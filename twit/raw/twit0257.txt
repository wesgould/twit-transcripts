[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   It's time for Tuit this week at Tech, the show that covers
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   the week's Tech News with the inked stained wretches of the new media.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280]   Starting with a man we haven't seen in ages.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   I think you've lost weight since you've been on the show.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   John C. Devorak.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   I think there's something wrong with the camera.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840]   He said, I look younger with the new lighting. You look thinner.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.280]   You look fantastic.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.640]   I think there's something wrong with the camera.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   I think I'm squished.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   I think it's you.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   I think it's you.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.280]   Maybe it's me. Maybe I've squished you.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   Let me ask you this, and I hope you won't take this the wrong way.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.000]   I've taken it the wrong way already.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.280]   Are you anamorphic?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.520]   What does that even mean?
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.680]   No, no.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   You're definitely not anamorphic.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   There it goes.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.760]   Also here, yeah, you heard him.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.040]   Steve Gibson's back.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   We so glad to have you.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   Hey, Gippo.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280]   Hey, Gippo.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280]   Gibby, yeah.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.800]   Gibson is the guy in charge at grc.com. He makes spin right and has been in this business
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.120]   for longer than mud.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.840]   We really wanted to get you on it too, John, on our gray hair edition of Twit.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   A couple of weeks back.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   Yeah, I missed out on that.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.000]   I think I was traveling or something.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.440]   That would have been a good one for me because I think you had Jerry on.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   Yeah, Pournell.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   Then we did it.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   And the next one will do will be in no hair edition.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   No hair edition.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   Also here we got a youngster, a young man, a non-shimpy who started covering technology
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.880]   when he was in high school with a site that has become now the site to read if you want
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.160]   hardcore hardware news, a non-tech.com, a non-great to see you once again.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   Thank you, sir.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.440]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.680]   Big story today and really the big story of the week and for the last couple of weeks
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280]   is the antenna story on the iPhone 4.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.440]   And on, you guys did a great job.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   We referred to you a number of times last week and the week before with your coverage,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.920]   partly because you and Brian were able to hack the iPhone 4 a little bit and give us
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   some actual readings.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.200]   Yeah, that was actually key to all of this because you'll actually even notice in Apple's
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   press conference, when they presented data, they still presented it in visual bar format,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   which is just, that doesn't actually tell you anything, right?
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.840]   Like it's not comparable, comparable between phones.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.080]   And luckily when the minute Brian got his phone, he was like, "Hey, I bet you I know
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.120]   how to enable numeric readouts on signal strength."
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.440]   And that's really what set it off.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.600]   Well, how did he do that?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.360]   Because one of the things that I thought this was kind of a smoking gun that Apple did
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.240]   in iOS 4 is they took out the diagnostic mode that allowed you to see exactly what kind
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.040]   of signal you were getting.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.280]   So they pulled out field test and, you know, and I don't know if you do that unless you
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.560]   thought the numbers were going to be very positive.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.040]   I mean, I don't like to go down the conspiracy theory path simply because there are a lot
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.960]   of things that, you know, it can go both ways, right?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.600]   But whatever they pulled it out, luckily Brian Clueg, our senior smartphone guy, he
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.840]   actually had quite a bit of experience with iOS, how it stores data and with jailbreaking
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   these things.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   And he found that, you know, if you, it actually stores the configuration of that little status
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   bar, that little status area when you back up your phone.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   So he thought, "Well, if I have a phone where I have this enabled on iOS 3, 2."
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.680]   And I used that backup once I put iOS 4 once I get an iOS, an iPhone 4.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.360]   And then I restore that backup on there.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.280]   You know, maybe it'll preserve that setting.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   Wow.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.360]   And thankfully and luckily enough, it actually does.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.280]   And Apple hasn't even pulled that out in 401 or 401 either.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   So we, and we were, we for sure thought that they were going to pull that out as soon as,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.160]   as soon as we published how to do it.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.240]   But no, it's still there.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.360]   So that actually helped us tremendously.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.040]   And your follow up as well, because you were able to go back and see how 4.01, which Apple
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.560]   released last week, modified things.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   And you have a great graph that shows the new way of measuring bars.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   It looks like they increased the dynamic range of the bars.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.880]   So a couple of things we noticed, and Brian again was actually the first to pick this
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   out.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.560]   One, you get more values, right?
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.960]   So for example, on, on prior to 401 and 401, you might see negative 113 dB and then negative
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.200]   100 dB, right?
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.760]   You, you might, there are a bunch of values in there that you would just never see.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.040]   And with 401 and 401, you actually, you just see a lot more numbers.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.660]   And that, that actually helps, you know, really tell you what's going on here.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:15.560]   This is the, the graph that is, is very telling that shows movement from 4 to 4.01 in the
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   signal mapping.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   And yeah.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   So that was actually sent in by a reader of ours.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.240]   We were working with them behind the scenes and he was like, Hey, I put this together.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.360]   Maybe it'll help your readers.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.120]   And then I sent him the data we got off of 401.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   And he just made a new one there.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.840]   And then the one below that actually shows it's something we made.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.720]   And that, that shows the comparison between 4, 401 and Android.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   So you can really see that, that Apple is being a lot more honest with how signal strength
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.800]   is reported now, which is impressive.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.640]   You know, we have to give them credit for that.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.320]   They, they're doing the right thing there.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.880]   It's almost linear now instead of log Rythmith, which it traditionally is log Rythmic, but,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.920]   but even more interesting, instead of going down to 113 dB below, it goes all the way
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   down to 121.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.240]   In other words, you'll still get a bar, even if you've got almost no signal at all.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   Yep.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.600]   And it really shows the, it's designed to show the improved sensitivity of the iPhone 4 wireless
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.840]   platform in general, right?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.720]   So antenna, baseband, radio, power amps, the whole deal.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.080]   It actually does a really, really good job down at 115, negative 115, negative 120, 121.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.360]   When we were talking about this, Steve with Jerry Pournell, he's, he made a point which
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.240]   I thought, and I've echoed several times, was really great, which is, these are digital
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.440]   phones.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.760]   And if it doesn't work, I mean, if you don't have enough signal, it doesn't work.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   If you do, it does.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.240]   It's really a binary situation.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.720]   What do you need bars for?
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:53.840]   And I got a very interesting email from a BBC satellite engineer, Dave in North Holt London,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   which I thought, and he called me out on this.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.960]   He says, "I keep hearing you say, 'Get rid of the bars.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   Show a binary.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.440]   You can make calls light.'"
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.000]   As a broadcast satellite engineer, I completely disagree.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.560]   The phone channel is very much like the satellite signals I deal with every day.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.720]   The satellite down links include forward error correction.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.520]   The receiver puts the signal back together and either decodes pictures or shows nothing
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   like the phone.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.440]   And it's binary in the sense that it works or it doesn't work.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.000]   However, when it's working, it's able to tell you how hard the error correction is working.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.640]   If it says it's not having to work hard, then we know we can take, say, 10 dBs of rain fade
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.000]   before we lose the signal, it's being broadcast.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.840]   If it says it's near the edge of failure, then we know if there's a thunderstorm, we're
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.080]   going to get a five-minute outage in transmission instead of a 10-second outage.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   And one of the other things that we know is that cell phones do dynamically scale their
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.080]   own power output as a function of the received power from the local cell tower.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   So if you have a weaker signal, you tend to drain your battery faster because the cell
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.080]   phone ramps up working on output power in order to compensate for the fact that it's
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.120]   got a weaker incoming signal.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.880]   So the idea of just having an on/off light is probably not good.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.080]   I mean, it's not enough.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.240]   The bars do actually have some value you're agreeing on.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.040]   Yeah, I mean, it's more of, I actually agree with the engineer that sent you that email.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.040]   It's actually more of a predictive visualization, right?
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.000]   It tells you the likelihood that something bad is going to happen or that you're going
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.200]   to be able to continue the call.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.040]   And that's actually one of the reasons why there's so much of an issue with this antenna
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.640]   bridging or attenuation problem because it really interferes with the predictive nature
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.080]   of that visualization.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.840]   It's no longer a prediction, right?
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.200]   There's this new variable in play, or at least more of an existing variable in play.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.600]   I trust the other problem too is that our head and holding it next to our head is going
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.280]   to change the reception.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.000]   And so you're not actually looking at the bars while you're talking.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.920]   You pull it away from yourself.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.560]   There is a delay in the bars updating.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.680]   But that's also one of the things that this changing is how close it is to you.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.000]   I talked to an antenna engineer on the radio show today.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.320]   He said, "I asked him, is it a bad design decision to put the antenna external on the
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   phone?"
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.680]   He said, "It's a bad design decision like, say, putting square wheels on a car would
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   be a bad design decision."
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.920]   He said, "Well, two things are happening here.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.040]   By touching the antenna, you're detuning it.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.600]   Your antennas are optimized for a wavelength.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.480]   Your finger changes the wavelength that's optimized for.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   You're detuning it."
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.720]   He says, "The meat of your hand is also attenuating the signal.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   It's weakening it."
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.640]   So those two things together really cause the antenna to do a much worse job.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.800]   But Anand, it sounded like your findings were that the iPhone 4 is still better than previous
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   iPhones.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   Yeah, and here's the problem, right?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.240]   So I don't like to do a lot of armchair engineering because I know these projects, you
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.760]   know, even the iPhone 4, they're worse than yours.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   They had cots in there.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.800]   They were there all night.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.280]   There were people in the parking lot at 3 AM and they were shocked when they found out
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   that the bar-
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   Well, I mean, they're worse than yours.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   Yeah, they're worse than yours.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   Still a lot better than me, right?
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   Right.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.760]   So I got to give credit for credit to do.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.360]   And I'll tell you the way I look at it.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.240]   There are definitely some areas where, especially in situations where there's very, very limited
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.760]   signal or very, very low signal strength, the iPhone 4 does very, very well.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.200]   This I would say is more of an annoying design decision or an annoying problem than anything
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   else.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.840]   But now here's where John Zeevorek gets involved because John, you and I are media guys.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.800]   And the first thing Steve Jobs does, he comes out on the stage and he says, he starts blaming
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   the media.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.080]   He calls it antenna gate.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.320]   He says, you know, the return rate on the iPhone 4 is far lower than it was in the 3GS this
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   time last year.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   You know, we only-
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   That's the only-
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   No, nobody's returning.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.200]   We only drop one more call per 100 than the iPhone 3GS did.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   He said, there's no problem here.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.120]   The media made the problem.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.800]   The sense to me, almost Nixoni and John-
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   It was weird.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.200]   A lot of people are wondering what if he's losing his marbles.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   I mean, for one thing, the media is the one that made this phone such a massive success
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.360]   in the first place because of all the planted stories.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.120]   And so then to blame the media for somebody just questioning the situation that we're
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.360]   talking about, the phone antenna and tenuation, is it's almost ludicrous.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.520]   I think, I don't think he should have done that.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.160]   I think it made him look like an idiot.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.400]   He also, again, in a very Nixoni and Way said, well, other phones have this problem.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   It's not just a phone.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   And that voice, too, I understand.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   That's his.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.440]   I have a dog named Chekker's.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.400]   I have a good cloth coat and the media are the problem here.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.960]   Well, so I would argue that, you know, there were some issues that were caused by the media.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.400]   I mean, it was a general lack of understanding of the problem.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   Really?
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   Really?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.040]   You think that we caused the problem?
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.120]   No, no, I- well, Leo, I'm not saying you caused the problem, but I'm saying this.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.080]   When we published our review, right, we went into it and we said, look, here's the situation.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.240]   It does drop more than other phones.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.640]   It is something that impacts all phones and you can reduce it by potentially coding the
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.600]   stainless steel with something that's a design decision Apple would have to make, or you
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.160]   just put a case on it, right?
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   And that was it.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   That's old.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.920]   He also blamed us for not buying more cases.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.080]   If you had just bought more cases, this was a problem.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.280]   Well, you know, and I think the problem isn't entirely how it was handled in the media,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   right?
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.760]   It was also an issue of how Apple handled it, right?
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.000]   They weren't forthcoming with this.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   And on top of that, even when they said that they were forthcoming with it in the press
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.080]   conference, they still really weren't, right?
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.840]   Like it's a downside to the way Apple conducts its secret projects, unfortunately, right
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   now.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.560]   But yeah, I think this did point out that this whole education through entertainment way
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:20.200]   of reporting news, you know, we're heading down a path that's not necessarily any better
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.960]   than where cable TV news has taken us.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.880]   And I do think he's right.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   I think he's fair in saying that, look, some of the media reports really criticized this
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   the wrong way.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.560]   And you know, I do think there was a lot of fair handling of it.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.880]   I think it was the media reports specifically you're talking about that handled this in
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.040]   some unfair way specifically.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.160]   Well, if you look at and, you know, it's not my job to kind of throw my peers out of
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.680]   the bus and I've never felt comfortable doing that because everyone does a good job at
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.800]   what they do and everyone has their own.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   Oh, that's a lie.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   Come on, Anand.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   Say it.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   Say it.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   Nobody really have anybody in mind.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.240]   Some people don't do a good job, Anand.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.920]   Everyone everyone has their own justifications for doing what they do.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.480]   And in my opinion, the problems I had were just going out of the question.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.200]   So John, you answer it then.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   Who did a crappy job?
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.840]   I think everybody did a fine job.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.240]   What job was there to do?
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.960]   People who are holding the phone, they couldn't get a signal and they bitched about it.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   I mean, they were right.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   Well, that was fine.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   Right.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:27.360]   The issue was characterizing in this light of, hey, it might be a phone by phone issue, right?
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.760]   Especially when the hard facts and the evidence were out there.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.400]   You know, we published numbers, right?
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.240]   We published numbers, we told people how to find, how to prove the numbers for themselves.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.960]   And we said, this is the story.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.320]   And what continued to perpetuate was this idea that, hey, we might need to recall, we
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.760]   might need, this might be on a phone by phone basis.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.160]   And all of that, in my opinion, didn't actually serve any real purpose.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   Right.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.760]   We established from the very start, this is a physical problem.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.320]   Like this is, this is an issue with physics.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.800]   There's no getting around it.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.920]   If you want to get around it, Apple would either have to get it.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.400]   I don't think anybody was arguing any differently.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.040]   I think the pundits who came out and said, oh, there's going to have to be a recall.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.720]   I think that's still a valid possibility because the phone is actually defective the
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   way it's made.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.280]   And sure, they're going to give everybody a free cover now.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.960]   But the fact of the matter is I don't think that anybody was unjustified in these particular
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   complaints.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.600]   If there was, I would also say that not everybody reads, you know, your, your report.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.120]   I mean, if everybody read your report, they'd be a little more knowledgeable.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.200]   I'm not going to argue against that idea.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.560]   But you know, I don't think it was that crazy.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.000]   Do consumer reports mis misstated or was there testing flawed and on?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   What do you think?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.120]   No, I mean, I think it seems like they're testing echoed our testing, which is fine.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.440]   And it's up to that publication, whether or not they feel that that's grounds for not
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.680]   recommending it.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.800]   You know, ultimately from my standpoint, it was a combination of, look, this is the
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   design decision.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   These are the design decisions that Apple made.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.680]   You have to take that into account with how good your AT&T reception is.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.120]   And if the combination of the two is bad, maybe you shouldn't get the phone, right?
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   But it's, it's really.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.640]   That's what I would say.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.840]   That's my recommendation is, and by the way, I think that what has happened here is good
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.880]   because there are choices now for three years I put up with really frankly bad AT&T service.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.880]   Just where I live.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.800]   I'm not saying everywhere where I live where I work.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.520]   And San Francisco, it's bad.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.320]   So I put up with it because there was no choice.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.000]   That was the iPhone AT&T.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   That was the nexus.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.120]   You had to do that.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.920]   As soon as great phones have come out on every carrier now, and I'm carrying a Droid X now
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.640]   from, which I love from Verizon, and it's like, I'm saying, oh my God, why was I putting
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   up with AT&T?
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.240]   That's because you're using it as a phone.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.760]   Well, I know, but it is a phone, John.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.040]   Well, I'm telling you, the whole iPhone phenomenon is more of a, it's, I wouldn't call it a
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.840]   cult, but I call it an environment that is completely, takes care of its users.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.760]   It's a totally different animal than any other phone.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.240]   And I think it has to be recognized as such.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   But not anymore.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.920]   And this is why I don't, I disagree.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.480]   And this is why I think that, yeah, it was blowing, I would say maybe, and now it's right,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.640]   it's blown out of proportion a little bit because people kept talking about it for day
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   after day after day.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.680]   I never seen so much stupid reporting.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.000]   And so I'll agree with that.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.360]   But at the same time, when you create an environment, it's like Facebook that lives among, it's
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.500]   kind of its own animal and something is, and it's injured, people are going to get all
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.600]   worked up about it.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.800]   And I don't think you can criticize them for doing so.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.680]   But you're saying Apple is hoist by its own petard.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.960]   I would argue that, that obviously, you know, Leo, you like your droid X. I think Android
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   is just as capable of the platform.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.720]   The difference here is really a matter of aesthetics and polish, right?
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.320]   Apple puts a lot of, a lot of focus on making sure the iPhone works like an appliance.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.680]   And with Google, you have more of like a portable computer.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.760]   And for some people, clearly there are a lot of iOS and iPhone fans.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.400]   And for some people, that's exactly what they want.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.680]   And for others, you know, there are a lot of Android devices sold.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.640]   I think, I agree with Leo, there's a good thing to have this kind of choice.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.920]   And the network isn't bad for everyone.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.080]   That's what's changed is now.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.600]   So now you choose the network that works best first.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.400]   You choose your, to me, what's changed is.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   So Leo, let's get this straight.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.440]   Let's stop.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.600]   So tomorrow iPhone, and actually this probably will happen by March.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.520]   iPhone is on Verizon.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.600]   Does that change your entire perspective?
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.280]   No, because, well, first of all, we make a lot of people happy because a lot of people
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.120]   have been waiting for that day.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   Maybe it would, at least gives you a choice.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.200]   My point is you should do what we've done for years until 2007 and the iPhone came out
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.760]   is choose a carrier.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.400]   First, who has the best signal where I use the phone?
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.160]   Then what's the best phone from that carrier?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.360]   The iPhone flipped it on its head.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.640]   You chose the iPhone and then you were stuck with the carrier.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.880]   That's what changed and it only changed for a couple of years.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.440]   And I think that window has now closed on that.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   I think you can, and that's to Apple's detriment because it means his competition.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.920]   But now you choose the carrier and then you choose the phone.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.880]   I think the position that Apple's in is one of having inertia now because they were first
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.720]   and had essentially the, you know, this whole sort of high-end smartphone market to themselves
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   for so long.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.000]   But with Android, this really, I mean, it's a game changer.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.440]   We're not going to see it overnight, but over time, I think it certainly will happen.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:27.680]   And I read that the AT&T exclusivity wasn't expiring until 2011 despite the fact that Bloomberg
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.520]   has said that they expect to see it on Verizon next year.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.560]   I was like, "This year is 20/11.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.560]   Hello."
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.560]   Congratulations.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.560]   What year is it?
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.120]   By the way, we want to welcome Lisa Bettany, who has joined us.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   Lisa is the most Lisa blogger and it's great to see you.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   Can I blame you?
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   Can I blame Canada?
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   Blame Canada?
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   Sure.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   Why not?
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   We just don't have.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.480]   Well, it felt like it.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   The traffic.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   What is with this traffic?
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.120]   Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.680]   Is there an event over there today?
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.440]   No, it's Doyle Drive, I think is what bit you, right?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   Over by the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   All that construction.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   Anyway, it's nice to have you.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.440]   Welcome.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   We're talking about the iPhone and Tenegate as, by the way, Sparky and Corona keeps correcting
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   me in the chatroom.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.040]   Apparently, Computer World was the first to call it in Tenegate.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.480]   But Steve Jobs picked it up.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.040]   That doesn't make him any less next Sony in the Wall Street Journal coined the term
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.480]   Watergate because Joel Shea, I'm not a crook.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   I guess the one thing that we haven't looked at and I know I respect a non's decision not
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.320]   to be conspiracy oriented, but doesn't it really seem to be the case that Apple did get
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.440]   caught fudging the algorithm for its bars?
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.600]   This idea that they were shocked that this formula was wrong.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.520]   I mean, the fact is the formula that they originally had ended up showing many more
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:57.160]   bars for their normal range of signal strengths compared to, first of all, what it is now
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.880]   and also what other phones were doing.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:06.080]   So from a marketing standpoint, you given the same amount of received signal strength
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.400]   by the iPhone traditionally with the equation that they had that someone deliberately
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.600]   set the parameters to somewhere, it looked better than other phones.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   It's a little loud.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   I mean, they kind of...
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   Yeah, that was cheating.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   That was a dirty thing to do.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   It really was.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   Dirty wrap.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   But everyone does that, right?
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.080]   So if you look at that graph that we just showed, the one at the bottom of the page that
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   Leo had up on the screen, Apple's...
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.440]   I mean, they're definitely worse if you look at 4.0 versus 2.2 on the Nexus 1, but they're
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.000]   not that much worse, right?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   Every all cell phone companies lie about this.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   It's just that Apple now had a situation where the signal would drop more than the competitors
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.160]   and that kind of exposed this as a problem.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.320]   But everyone does this.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.520]   Right now Apple corrected it and they corrected it pretty quickly.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.800]   And now they're actually more honest than a lot of folks have ever pulled out.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.560]   So now you can say the bars on the iPhone are the best bars in the business.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   Well, and Apple did say...
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.360]   Well, see if I had the testing.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.640]   Well, did say that they were using AT&T's approved formula for showing the number of
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   bars.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.240]   I think what they said was we used our own formula, but now we're going to start using
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   AT&T's new formula.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   Right.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   Now they're going to use it.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.880]   I think the implication was they used AT&T's old formula, but I don't know if they said
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   that.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   There's a lot...
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.720]   I mean, I don't want to spend the rest of the day talking about this, but there's a
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.320]   lot of stuff to analyze in here.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.480]   For instance, Steve Jobs pointed out that maybe they didn't notice this because...
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   Well, he didn't say it quite like that.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He said...
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   A reporter said, "How come I'm not dropping bars on my blackberry now?"
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.520]   And Steve said...
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.280]   He said, "Well, because we have an AT&T tower on our campus."
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.400]   But he also threw an AND of a Ryzen tower on our campus, which I thought was kind of
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   gratuitous.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.000]   You know what's overlooked in this entire story, which kind of fascinates me?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   What?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.160]   Because nobody talks about the manufacturer of this phone.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.560]   It's not Apple sitting over there in Cupertino cranking these things out.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.360]   Let's blame Foxconn!
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.920]   It's Foxconn.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.360]   You think it's their fault?
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.320]   Well, I'm wondering about it.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   Was designed in California made in China?
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.000]   I think the basic functionalities designed in California and the components are picked
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   in California.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.280]   But when these guys are given a design and Steve says, "I want it like this.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.840]   I want this thing around the outside.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   I want a flat screen.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.280]   I want a flat back.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   I want this kind of glass.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.960]   I want you to do it this way."
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.040]   They're the ones who have to put...
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.960]   They're the ones who have to micro-engineer where everything goes so it fits in the phone
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.400]   that Steve wants.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.920]   They're the ones who had to put this antenna on there.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   I mean, it wasn't like...
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   Exactly.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   I think it really does matter.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   It really does matter.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:46.000]   It really does matter that as Leo points out, there is an AT&T and a Verizon cell tower
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.320]   on the Apple campus.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.560]   So they're all being irradiated by these particular carriers.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   I mean, you could probably hold this thing any way you wanted to.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.840]   You're standing in the shadow of the cell tower and never lose any bars.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   Good point.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   You probably...
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   Right.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   Me, me, as a solid...
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.400]   One of the reasons I've shifted away from the iPhone, I used it for a long time, is because
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.920]   I finally dropped four or five calls in a two-day period last Friday.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.360]   I said, "I'm sorry.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   This is a phone for me.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.680]   I needed it to be a phone."
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.920]   I got the Droid X and boy, I love the Droid X.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.600]   And you had a good alternative now.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   Yes.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   That's the point.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.520]   Now we have an alternative and that's the good news around all of this entirely.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.920]   Well, I don't think it's fair to assume that again, I don't like going down the conspiracy
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.000]   theory or the speculation ramp here.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.160]   I don't think it's fair to assume that they didn't test this thing in low signal strength.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   I think they came out and made the statement that, "Look, it gets the best reception of
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   any previous iPhone."
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.760]   Clearly, they tested this in all kinds of environments more than we ever had, more than
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.280]   anyone else ever had.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.800]   I think this was just a conscious decision.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.440]   They knew this trade-off was there.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.560]   And they're on this yearly cadence, right?
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.240]   So if you look at any company that has to produce a product every six months, 12 months,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:07.120]   24 months, whatever, you do make sacrifices in order to maintain that cadence.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.680]   We see it with chip companies all the time.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.960]   We see it in all kinds of products.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.520]   So it's not surprising to me that, "Look, if Apple discovered this and they were like,
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.280]   'Look, we have to ship this thing in X number of months.'
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.320]   Usually when you come to the end of a project like this, you have a list of things that
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.960]   you want fixed, but you just couldn't get them in the schedule without slipping in.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.400]   So they just get kind of rolled up and put into the next phone.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.080]   I think we do know also, though, that Steve Jobs loves the design of this phone and against
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.240]   some objections somewhere in Apple engineering, he said, 'No, this is the way it's going to
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   be.'
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.880]   They asked them that at the press conference that was a Bloomberg report.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.200]   He said it was BS.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.520]   He said it was BS.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   No.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.720]   He doesn't like the design of the phone.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   No.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   No.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   That's a good question.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   No.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.640]   I think what he was saying was, we didn't...
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.840]   I think what Steve was saying very clearly is we didn't think there was anything wrong
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   with it.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.520]   We still don't think there's anything wrong with it.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.680]   He has to say that now.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.400]   We think it's just like every other smart phone, but okay, if you think there's something
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.760]   wrong with it, we love you.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.120]   You're the customer, so we're going to give you a free bumper case.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.320]   That's my issue there.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.960]   So it loses more signal than at least its primary competitors.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.360]   That's the only part of what he has said that is not totally true.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.640]   Let me tell you, the rim guy was pissed.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.800]   The Nokia guys were pissed.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   They said, "What are you talking about?
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.520]   We don't have the same problem.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.880]   This is a unique problem for the iPhone 4."
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   You agree?
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.160]   No, it's not a unique problem for the iPhone 4.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.800]   As we've demonstrated, as everyone's demonstrated, all phones will drop signal depending on
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.920]   how you hold it.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.280]   What is unique to the 4 is that it drops more signal.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   We measured something like 16 to 17 dB on the iPhone 3GS and Nexus 1, and then the 4
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.200]   drops like 24 dB.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.720]   That's a measurable difference.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.760]   That part alone, the fact that it drops more than the competition is what's unique to the
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   4.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.040]   I think we should repeat ourselves on this topic.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   Oh no, I got lots more to say.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.960]   If you wear your antenna on your sleeve, that's what's going to happen.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.680]   Can I interject from the ones?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   Please leave.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   Some sanity.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   Injects some sanity into this.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.520]   Okay, so there's all these technical issues, but what does it boil down to for the actual
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.640]   customers that bought the iPhone 4?
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.400]   Because I've talked to a lot of them, and it doesn't even matter to them.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   People who bought the iPhone-
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   They seem not to care.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400]   Some do, I care.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   You care.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   But you don't even like the phone, Leo.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.120]   You hate Apple because they won't invite you to events.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.480]   Let's get that out there.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.040]   Alright, it's true, John.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   It's true.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.440]   No, no, I do like the phone.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   I think it's looking a little antiquated compared to Android, but it's still a great
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   phone.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.440]   Right.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.280]   Honestly, when you look at, okay, it's an answer to your question.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.640]   What does it mean to end users?
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.720]   Like I said, it's really a combination of what's AT&T's network like where you use the phone.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.680]   That's exactly where we're aligned.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.880]   If it's borderline, if there's a good chance that you don't have a good signal to begin
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.840]   with, this is probably not a good phone for you.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.760]   Do you think, Lisa, that people who have iPhones are willing to put up with crappy service?
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   Yes.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   That's what you're saying.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   Yeah, I agree with Lisa.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.200]   I mean, I wouldn't call, I mean, I guess yes, I'm an Apple fan girl.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.760]   Well, you're sitting in front of a 3GS, not an iPhone 4, by the way.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.920]   Oh, well, yes, because mine's in the mail.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.320]   But I've been testing on one all week.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.600]   And I mean, for me, obviously, the camera really matters.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.840]   The HD video really matters.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:47.720]   But ultimately, when you subscribe to Apple and you have all Apple products, it doesn't
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720]   even matter.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.360]   That's a sad thing, but to me, it doesn't even matter.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.600]   It's sad.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   It is sad.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   It is sad.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.440]   I mean, I've been talking to people and people that love the iPhone, they don't care.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.120]   John Louis Gasey, who may, you might say, have an axe to grind.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.280]   He was a vice president at Apple under Steve Jobs.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.480]   He was there for a long time after Jobs left.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.000]   He started BOS.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And now he blogs.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   And I think he actually does a great blog at mondaynote.com.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.600]   And he says Apple mishandled this.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   He says, and Tenegate, if you can't fix it, feature it.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.480]   And don't diss your customer or the media.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.080]   He said, Apple basically decided it's not a bug.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   It's a feature.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.880]   He says, yes, it's a well-known problem.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.360]   But he says, this is science fiction.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.480]   I think we beat this up to death already.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.880]   So if I read those things, he just said, we just said.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.200]   He says, a customer complaint dialogue is structured around a two-position toggle.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.160]   It's terrible or it's nothing.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.120]   And it's not terrible and it's not nothing.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   It's kind of in the middle.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.760]   I mean, and as you said a nod, if your signal is good, then live and you like the phone,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   that's fine.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   And if your signal is bad and you want a phone that works, then there are other choices.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.760]   Okay, now I'm going to drop it, John.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   Now let's talk about Nokia suing Apple.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.280]   What are they suing Apple about?
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.080]   A bunch of patent suits.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   Oh, everybody.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.640]   Apple's suing everybody, everybody's suing Apple.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.280]   No, but Nokia's got a pretty good case.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   Really?
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.400]   All right, we're quickly all googling Nokia Apple lawsuit.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.320]   And I'll tell you this much.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.120]   The kicker nobody wants to talk about is, and I've been in these lawsuits as an expert
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:43.960]   witness on different things, and the kicker is Steve Jobs has publicly said over and over
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:50.040]   that if you're going to steal, you steal from the best and the good art of steel, and
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.600]   it's going to be thrown in their face.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   Interesting.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:01.000]   Nokia was not happy, by the way, about Nokia said, "We prioritize antenna performance
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.120]   over physical design, basically implying that Apple did not."
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:12.600]   Rims co-chief executives said Apple's attempt to draw Rims into Apple's self-made debacle
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   is unacceptable.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   Apple's claims about Rims products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.760]   understanding of antenna design and deflected attention from Apple's difficult situation.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.600]   These guys are coming out swinging too.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   Wow.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   They're not happy.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   I don't blame them.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.200]   Well, yeah, I mean, part of the issue is, I believe Steve said, look, as we're a, as
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.400]   we become a leader in the smartphone space, it's our job to educate consumer.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.640]   The problem is, whenever I have a company tell me that they need to help educate consumer,
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.320]   that's usually like the marketing bells go off and I'm like, "Hey, that's not your job.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.400]   That's actually my job."
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.160]   And that's the problem, right?
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.640]   They did this under the guise of educating the consumer, but they weren't totally forthcoming,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   right?
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.600]   All they said were, "Here's some pictures of bars.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.720]   Look what happens.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.000]   See everyone has the problem."
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.880]   And that's not how education works, right?
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.720]   If you sit in science class, they don't just show you pictures and then that's it.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.160]   I think if the media misrepresented at all, the only misrepresentation was that losing
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.840]   bars meant you were going to lose calls.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.800]   And I think that's a false correlation.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.160]   And so I think the media implied that the problem was the bars going down.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.720]   I mean, a lot of people have said that the reception on the iPhone 4 is actually better
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.120]   than the 3GS.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.680]   I think Apple's saying that.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   Is that not?
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.120]   What we've said conclusively is that in low signal situations, that's true.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.000]   As we showed in our second article, it really varies other times.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.560]   I mean, you will get either much better signal than the 3GS or much worse in kind of normal
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.400]   operating situations.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.080]   And unfortunately, there's just no real way to draw a thorough conclusion on that without
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.160]   one of Apple's $100 million labs.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.520]   That's a beautiful lab, too.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.040]   Do you see the pictures on the Apple website?
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.520]   Man, that's sweet looking.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   It looks nice.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.680]   I wouldn't mind one.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.960]   So the conclusion is it was a mistake to put the antenna on the outside.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   Yes.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.440]   But we're stuck with it for a year.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   Yes.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.240]   Until they do the next version of the iPhone.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.160]   Or at least they're going to fix something in a couple of months.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.120]   I think they're I think they're going to fix it because September 30th, that arbitrary
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.240]   day where they stopped in cases, that sounds to me like they figure Steve kind of even
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.160]   implied that in the Q&A.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.200]   We use that day because we think we might be able to, you know, fix this by then.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   It's not a software fix, right?
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.280]   And on, is it a hardware fix?
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.480]   No, see, I wouldn't actually go as far as to say it was a mistake to put the antenna
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   on the outside, right?
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.960]   So in our second article, we pointed out that, or Brian got a hand on his hand on like the
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:44.160]   perfect one mill captain tape that fits perfectly around the band.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.720]   And it fixes about half the problem and actually brings the phone almost in line with like
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.760]   the Nexus one and three GS.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.920]   So you know, maybe the laps is more in the materials engineering side of it.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.800]   You know, they might have just needed a non-conductive coating on the stainless steel band.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Well, that's what I think they're going to do.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   I think it's just that.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.280]   They're going to do so.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.400]   And there has even been a rumor that some people who've gotten newer iPhones, Lisa, tell
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.840]   us when you get your iPhone that, you know, you right now on the iPhone 4, you can feel
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.240]   a little dip where that black plastic thing is.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.200]   By the way, Steve said, you know, the only mistake we made, we put that black, that plastic
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.600]   thing and that called attention to it.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.800]   You guys, you found it.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.160]   How does anodeising help anything?
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   Isn't that conductive?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   No, they're not.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.720]   No, anodeising is an oxide coating and oxide is an insulator.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.120]   So insulating it, in other words, right.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.480]   And it sounds like that's what they've done.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.600]   People are saying it's a little smoother there than it was and it feels a little silkier.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   And so maybe they can.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   So we actually tested that.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.400]   I got a, the idea was, you know, anything made after week 27.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.960]   And the way you find out what week you have is you pull up the serial number and I think
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.240]   digits number four and five and to take the week.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.200]   So we got a week 28 iPhone, something that was bought like a day before our article went
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.400]   live and we measured resistance across that band to see if it was still conductive and
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   it was still conductive.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.600]   So I think it's too early to tell at this point if they are introducing a fix like that.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.640]   So there's no software software can't fix this, can it?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.200]   No, no, this is a, this is a physics issue.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.520]   We can't fix physics with software.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   Okay.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.160]   I think we've all learned something here.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.080]   We're going to take a break and come back.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.480]   Good news for the PC industry.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.880]   Great news for Intel, but even for AMD and I like to hear that.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.160]   Our guests, Lisa Bettany for mostly Lisa.com.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   So nice to see you.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.800]   So nice to see you.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.360]   Pete Cashmore was supposed to be here, but he's looking at houses.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Well, it's, it's impossible.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.640]   I mean, we've been looking for a place for the last week, but it's just like we're both
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.400]   in meetings or both doing things.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   No, this is the weekend.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.240]   This is when you go to the open houses and I thank you for for going it.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.600]   You know, Pete's going to pick a place.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.360]   It's got like lots of pinball machines and you're going to, you're going to love it.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.000]   It'll be fantastic.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   You know, it's going to be a guy house.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.040]   As long as I'm here, I mean, I want to be here.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.120]   I think it's it needs to happen.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   Bay Area here.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   You mean?
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   You're going to have to get rid of that iPhone though.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   Check it at the gate.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.440]   I've been using T-Mobile.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.640]   Have you with your iPhone?
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   Yeah, because I can do that.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   And how's that then?
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   Has it dropped calls?
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   No.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   Okay.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.280]   One more thing, Steve.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.760]   Steve, one more thing.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.640]   Steve could have blamed AT&T.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.840]   I was, I felt like Steve in his head is thinking, God, what a blame AT&T is so bad.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   And he didn't.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.600]   Was that a good, that's, that shows he has good impulse control.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.760]   I, you know, he's in the dog house with everyone.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.240]   Why didn't he blame AT&T?
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.600]   John, should he have blamed AT&T?
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.440]   Is it AT&T's fault?
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   No.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.840]   Fox guns fault.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.440]   Nobody wants to listen to that.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.400]   So it's goofy, but okay, John, we'll go with Foxconn.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   Don, non, should he blame AT&T?
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Is that really what he should have said is, look, I'm sorry, but it's AT&T.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.720]   No, no, I think, you know, he has to, everyone has to work in the realm of the reality that
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   is reality, right?
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   That's true.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   And reality is AT&T network.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   He shows AT&T.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720]   Right.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.920]   And this is the, this is the design they, they went with.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.600]   And I think the best thing to do is just be honest, open and willing to share as much
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.120]   data as physically possible.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.680]   And my only complaint is that they didn't do the latter part.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   And I'm just, go ahead.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.200]   I was just saying that I am pleased that they're, they're giving out the bumpers at least,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.840]   which I, you know, it's, it's the one thing that we asked them to do in our articles.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.960]   We said, look, this is the right thing to do other than a design change.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   Right.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   I agree.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   Make him, make him wear a case.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   An Anshampi is here from an on tech.com.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.640]   So nice to have you.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   It's your source for hardware analysis and news at an on tech.com.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.800]   Steve Gibson also here, grc.com, the guy who hosts our security now show.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.120]   It's always welcome in the Tutt cottage.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   More to come in just a bit.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.640]   But first I want to tell you about carbonite pro, a backup solution that is perfect for
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   business.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.320]   Many of it, you know, this all came about because carbonite, which created a great consumer
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   backup solution.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.920]   It's automatic backs up the cloud.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   It's a, e s 256 bit encrypted.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   It's under 28 business.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.760]   S L, you know, all the buzzwords.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.240]   It's just a great solution.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.360]   A lot of businesses said, well, we want this too.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.040]   So they were using individual copies of carbonite on every computer.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.360]   Well, that's fine, but, but carbonite said, well, we really should do better for business.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:38.440]   And they came up with carbonite pro, carbonite pro, designed for small business.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.680]   It's similar idea.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.520]   You put the client on all your computers.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.080]   No per seat charge you pay for storage used only.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.840]   It starts at $10 a month.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.520]   And it backs up automatically into the cloud, 128 bit SSL encryption.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.880]   So you never have to worry about the transport.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.040]   You can encrypt it once it's there as well.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.320]   So you don't have to worry about privacy.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.000]   You get a centralized dashboard, which is really nice.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.080]   So you know exactly which systems are backed up.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.880]   Your users can restore their files, not just on their own computer.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.400]   They can restore it from any computer they can get online with.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.080]   They can even restore it using the iPhone or BlackBerry applications.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.080]   Those are free.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.880]   So try carbonite pro today.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.720]   Absolutely free for the first month, 30 days free at carbonitepro.com.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.600]   Just all you have to do is just do a little thought experiment.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.360]   What would happen if our data was lost, if our backups were lost, would this business
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:38.120]   go on and you'll realize it's you need carbonite pro carbonite pro dot com.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:45.080]   People had a great quarter, best revenue ever in history, according to their quarterly
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.480]   report.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.800]   Furthermore, AMD would have actually had a profitable quarter, except for a write off
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.320]   they had to take on some factories that weren't so hot.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.280]   Is a nod would be a good guy to ask, because you cover the PC industry very closely.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:06.040]   Is this cost cutting or is this actual growth in the PC industry?
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.600]   I think Intel said, and forgive me, I didn't look at the in great detail.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.560]   It's like how many more billions of dollars did you make now?
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.200]   I think they accredited to a lot of their success in the enterprise side, which makes
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   sense.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.600]   You look at the growth of cloud services and just a lot of stuff going on in the data
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   center.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.080]   And AMD is hanging in there.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.280]   It's impressive that they've been able to do this much and have this kind of a turnaround
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.800]   with a brand new architecture, anything like that, which we will get next year.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.280]   So overall, I don't see the PC industry going anywhere.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.800]   It's still the foundation we need to get things like the holodeck and all the cool stuff
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.480]   we see in minority reports and stuff like that.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.760]   But you're not going to get that on a smartphone for another 10, 20 years.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.080]   Obviously, it's just not where the growth is happening right now.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.480]   We need the PC because we want the holodeck.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   I mean, it's true.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   No, you're right.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   You're right.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.880]   You got to write the software on a PC.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.520]   Intel's net income, $2.89 billion, 51 cents a share.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.000]   It's the best quarter they've had in 10 years.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.120]   In fact, the last time Intel's net income was bigger than $2.5 billion was the year
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.440]   2000 during the dot com boom.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.000]   And AMD's, as you said, AMD's report was also very positive.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.920]   In fact, Microsoft will report next week.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.240]   And it's predicted that, well, if this is true, if there's growth like this, Microsoft
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.960]   should also have a very, very good quarter.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.680]   So I guess that's good news.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.200]   It makes you wonder whether come, I'm sorry, John.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:51.600]   I agree kind of with the assessment that the business, we just witnessed as a bunch
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.280]   of pent up demand for replacement products.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.480]   I mean, there's all these old machines out there running XP.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.840]   Microsoft says screw that.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.120]   We're not even going to support it anymore.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.840]   You get SB three and you'll barely get some support.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.520]   You better buy some new gear.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.000]   So everybody bought a bunch of new computers.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.760]   I think they may sit on these computers for the decade for all.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.360]   We know there's nothing, there's no reason to have a quad or an eight core CPU.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.720]   We don't have anything to run on it.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.560]   I mean, it's really professional 3D work video encoding.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.960]   We're just bragging rights.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.000]   I mean, so I didn't experiment, right?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.640]   I've got like an eight core 16 thread desktop.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   And you're just saying.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.520]   Well, you know, so once Aaron Dale came out and started the new 2010 mobile core, I three
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.200]   I five, I seven, I was like, look, maybe this thing's fast enough where I wouldn't notice
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   the difference.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.720]   And part of this is just I'm crazy, right?
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.640]   But I seriously noticed the difference.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   I was like, this is too slow.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.240]   I have to go back to my desktop.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   But you know, John is right.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   What are you doing on there?
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Wait a minute, Nahn.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.840]   What are you doing on that thing that you notice the difference?
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:00.040]   How long does it take to boot Wordstar?
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.960]   You know, I do all of my writing and Wordstar.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.520]   So that's actually the number one benchmark.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   You and Jerry Prenel.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   Are you a gamer?
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   And on?
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   Is that why you need that?
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   You know, it's not all gaming.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.360]   I honestly don't have as much time for gaming as I'd like to.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.560]   And well, I'll say that for another time.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.440]   But no, it's, you know, I do all the in on tech work there, right?
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.480]   So I'm in the middle of publishing an article.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.800]   I've got quite a bit that I'm working on at the same time.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.400]   I'm not being coding videos in the background while I'm editing, I don't know, 200 or 300
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   photos.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.560]   I have all sorts of data that I'm manipulating and trying to circle them and browse all these
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   different sites.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.600]   And I just, you know, got like a security cam monitor for like seven security cameras
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   open in the background.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.680]   Like there's just a bunch of stuff happening.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.160]   So for a user like me, you know, the desktop is still where you can get that kind of best
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   performance.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.960]   But I will agree with John that, you know, the software just isn't that exciting to take
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   advantage of stuff.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   It is a yawn, isn't it?
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   It was.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.280]   And it's not going to get any more exciting with these iPhones and androids and the other
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.480]   platforms, but mostly those two platforms, because all the coders that are creative and
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.440]   that can dream up this stuff are going to put because of the even though the software only
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.240]   sells for a dollar, they can make like a million dollars overnight, basically, with some nice
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   little app.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.960]   Now, so I'll take issue with that simply because so this is the argument everyone made
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.240]   went into an AMD hit a gigahertz, right?
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.280]   They were like, the software is yawn, my computer is fast enough.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.640]   I don't need to do anything.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.200]   And the counterpoint to that is if we just stop there, if that was truly the case, we
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.440]   would have never gotten YouTube, right?
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.160]   YouTube was built on the fact that everyone had a certain minimal level of performance
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.920]   and they could all do flash decoding, flash video decoding on the fly.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.720]   And I think that's where we're going to go, right?
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.040]   So you imagine a future where everyone's got at least four whores or at least eight threads
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.480]   or whatever, and it's going to take some really crazy people, but they're going to be
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.960]   able to do something very cool.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.160]   I'm not willing to give up on the hardware race until I have my holiday, right?
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:05.160]   Seriously, that used to be my attitude until I witnessed what's recently going on with
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.480]   this, the shrinking platform, the little platform, the handheld pocket platform.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   It's really the future.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   It's so exciting.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   I think they're so exciting.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.040]   Look at the whole half of the show has already been talking about just nothing more than just
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.440]   one of these phones.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.520]   And that's the phone you don't even like, Leo.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.560]   No, in fact, I noticed that not only with my shows, but with the radio show with everything
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.520]   I do, most of the conversation now is around cell phones.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.680]   I resisted that for a long time, but it is where innovation is happening right now.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   It's a platform.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   It's the new platform.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   It's taken over.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   What happens in the AC then?
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   We're having a lot of things.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.960]   The AC is not becoming, it's going to become a commodity at some point.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:43.360]   I mean, I can get an extremely powerful machine built or I can build one myself for $600.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.480]   The thing is like it's like a cra from like the 90s.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   It's astonishing.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.760]   When a non-tuxed app is this, what do you have?
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.280]   You have 12 cores.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.600]   Do you have eight cores?
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.560]   How many cores do you have on this desktop?
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   Eight cores.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.600]   So it's a two-ply core.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.440]   You're not going to get any extreme.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.320]   So you can have 12 cores.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.040]   I have that, but it's on a testbed.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.520]   And what the hell?
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.400]   What the hell are you going to do with 12 cores?
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   You can't do it with eight.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   That's my question.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   That's the big question.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:16.280]   Right now, a lot of the core rates is doing really, really well and obviously in servers,
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.000]   data centers, stuff like that.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.280]   But again, I think all we're seeing two years ago, the excitement was over netbooks, right?
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.800]   Yeah, that was a good question.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.960]   By the way, it looks like an aberration at this point.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.600]   It looks like that was kind of a mass delusion.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.520]   Well, so smartphones are particularly exciting and they're going to be more obviously prevalent
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:43.640]   than netbooks simply because we're able to cram decades of innovation in the PC industry
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   into a matter of a few years.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   Right?
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.160]   So if you look at how long it took for Intel to go from in-order architectures to an out-of-order
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.000]   architecture with the P6.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.320]   And that was several, several years, right?
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.280]   And we're seeing that kind of innovation in a very, very short period of time.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.480]   And we're going to continue to see that going forward, right?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:09.080]   So as Intel and AMD Global Foundries everyone, as they drive these manufacturing processes
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   down in physical transistricized, you're going to be able to get, and the other thing
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.280]   is the innovation has already happened, right?
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.880]   People already know the best way to optimally design a single core CPU or a dual core CPU
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880]   whatever.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.360]   It's just a question of how quickly can we get it into the right power out?
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.960]   And I think that's a big reason that you're seeing a lot of innovation here.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.240]   There's simply all the tricks have already been invented.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.760]   That's a question of when can we get it in the right power out look?
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.360]   And that happens like clockwork right now because of Moore's law.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.840]   Did I put everyone to sleep?
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.200]   Is that what you're trying to do?
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.360]   Can I take it like a slightly less geeky angle?
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   Please.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   Absolutely not.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:55.720]   I mean, let's think of people who have never really owned a computer and all of a sudden
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:02.040]   own an iPhone and have the ability to edit movies to put photos online.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   That's exactly right.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   I mean, there's this whole generation like even someone like my mother who I introduced
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.800]   to Mac products like how about iPad?
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   Do you think that that's another?
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:17.160]   I mean, I've poo pooed the iPad so much, but I just got one and it is replaced like I
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.440]   had a MacBook Air through that window when I got my iPad.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.080]   I didn't hit anybody with that.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.200]   It just sort of skimmed off.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.440]   How many skips did you get?
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   That's cool.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.440]   I actually wanted to.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.000]   Wouldn't it be good to skip the iPad in the air?
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   That'd be fun.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.800]   But you know, it's replaced that for me and it's so zippy.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   It's so quick.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.560]   It's so like it's light and I mean, someone like my mom who just wants to, you know,
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:49.400]   surf a few pages, do maybe a couple emails, add photos, look at photos.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.200]   I mean, there's that whole generation who doesn't care about 12 cores.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.080]   They don't know from cores.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.640]   They don't know anything about cores.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.000]   They just want to surf the internet and look at their Facebook account.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.280]   And I think there's this whole generation and even you look at sort of teenagers who
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.000]   want to just like put photos on Facebook.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.800]   They want to maybe tweet a little bit and there's that whole generation.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:20.040]   I think that's sort of where Apple is moving away from power users to, I don't know what
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.880]   to call them, just the normal people.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   Yeah, the normals.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.360]   So here's the issue I have with that, right?
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.880]   So I agree completely.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.080]   For browsing the web, you know, smartphones do it well enough.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.960]   Something with a larger screen like the iPad does a really good job.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.780]   I would encourage you to download pages, which is a pages for the iPad, which is Apple's
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.160]   document creation software.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.280]   And try making a flyer, right?
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.160]   Do the things that they show you on the video where you have a flyer.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.720]   I did this for my parents a few weeks back.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.120]   I created a little flyer, they were trying to sell their house and dragged in the pictures,
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.960]   made it, you know, did it the way that they do it on the little videos.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.720]   And that thing got unbearably slow because it's slow, right?
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.320]   It's not a good computer is what it is.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.720]   I think that a really useful way of dividing all these devices we've been talking about
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.560]   is content production versus content consumption.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   This is what James was saying.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.720]   He says there the PC is a truck for some everybody needs a truck.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.320]   Some people will always need a truck, but some people just need a sports car.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:31.840]   And so our large, our large, large, multi core desk, your truck.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:38.080]   Our large, our large multi core desktop machines are our content production engines, which
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.040]   really do that well with large screens and keyboards and mice.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:47.880]   But you don't need that for for content consumption, which the phone and the iPad both do really
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   well.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.560]   And, you know, I would also caution everyone in making sure we're out of shame that we're
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.480]   looking at this as a snapshot in time.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:04.040]   You know, 10 years ago, if we said, look, the PC is going to be your primary TV device.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.800]   And you know, the these set top boxes and TVs in general, people aren't going to spend
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.280]   much time with cable TV anymore.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.880]   People would call you crazy, right?
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.760]   But because of this kind of, because the software and the marriage of the software and
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.320]   the hardware, we've been able to kind of change that.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   And bandwidth.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.040]   Yeah, and bandwidth.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.760]   And I'm really, you know, I think what we're looking at is a snapshot in time where, look,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.240]   what you want to do today is Facebook and browse the web and this and that.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   And I think these devices are excellent for that.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   But I think in the long run, you're still going to see new categories of devices, new
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.940]   usage models.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.120]   It's not going to end right now, right?
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.040]   Like this isn't the best against.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.400]   And man, I'm telling you that, holodeck, you get there.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.720]   That's going to require a completely different type of device, whether it's a PC, whether
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.880]   it's just a big box full of cores that lives in your basement.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.120]   There's some interesting things that are being worked on right now.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.920]   I'm still hoping for the hoverboard.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.680]   Yeah, that was the best part of back to the future.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.600]   I take a hoverboard over holodeck.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.160]   I hit my head.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.800]   So if you wanted a Microsoft can and who doesn't?
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   You better get it now because according to Electronista, Verizon is going to return all
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.440]   unsold kin devices to Microsoft tomorrow.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.480]   Oh, we got to get one.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.040]   All online sales of the kin one and two have been suspended.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.760]   Basically the kin, which according to Electronista has only sold 9,000 units.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   He's not only so.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   That many?
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   John Gruber said 503.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:44.920]   He based that on an anonymous Microsoft source.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.600]   The real question is, is this going to end up in a landfill somewhere so that Michael
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:54.040]   J. Fox can hoverboard to it and find it and say, "Ooh, look at this, a kin."
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.280]   The kin, I mean, I think they're marketing campaign because I've been looking at sort
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.280]   of...
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   What went wrong?
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.040]   I mean, you look at the success of the old Spice guy.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   I mean, look at that.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.560]   Well, we're going to talk about him next.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.880]   Yeah, the success of that versus the kin where they hired all these actors to go out and
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   meet with their people on Facebook.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.000]   Shoot pictures of their up shirt, T-shirt pictures.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.760]   But I mean, ultimately, it's just a giant brick of...
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.360]   Sasha Segan on PC Magazine said, "The Kin's are miss begotten crippled creatures compared
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.760]   to pretty much every other smartphone on the market.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.400]   They've been priced as smartphones with smartphone data plans and they'll be sold
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.480]   as smartphones, but they're stupid."
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.160]   I had that part at the end.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.800]   So it was a miss begotten device.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.760]   Yeah, I mean, it's just...
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   I want one!
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.880]   John, we should corner the market on Kin's.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   You know, one of the big creatures...
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   I think there'd be great collectors at him in some kind of future.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.880]   I think so.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.920]   Especially that Kin won because it was so little and cute.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   The little round one.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.960]   You could stick it right in your bra and carry it around.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   Nobody know yet.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   Oh, I...
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.600]   Hey, I stopped wearing a bra, Leo.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   What about you?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   I've marked myself...
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:09.800]   You've made a big deal of the fact that he was able to synchronize with the cloud, which
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.080]   I don't think anyone really cared about that much.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.400]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.800]   It's like big deal, you know?
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   We really want that.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   We want...
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.280]   Well, I didn't like this one just some months back.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.520]   Lose its complete cloud at some point.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.160]   And all these people had to get their phone...
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   That was the sidekick, the danger sidekick.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   The sidekick.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   Which is also...
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   Who's gonna trust them?
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.160]   It's also been killed.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.560]   Well, I would say that, you know, the automatic cloud syncing stuff, Brian flew the
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.560]   antenna guy from our iPhone 4 stuff.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.680]   He actually did an article called Microsoft's Cana Ulogy.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.400]   And that was the one feature that he actually said, "Look, all phones need to have this.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.480]   This needs to be in Windows Phone 7.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.320]   This needs to be in future versions of Android and iOS."
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.480]   It's truly like a great example of something that you just...
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.640]   That just works that you don't really have to touch.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.360]   Now, the other aspects of the can, obviously, that's why it failed.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.040]   But the idea behind this that, you know, you take photos, everything you do is just stored
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.200]   in your own personal account online that you can access from anywhere.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   That is kind of cool, right?
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.400]   Because ultimately, at the end of the day, that's what we want.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.080]   We want all of our content on any device anywhere, anytime.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.680]   And the problem is, the anywhere, anytime issue.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.680]   I mean, I have...
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.600]   Who was up in Port Angeles floating around looking for a specific place out on a peninsula.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:26.040]   And I was using an XS1.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.200]   And the phone just...
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.480]   All of a sudden, there was no signal to be had, because I was in Zissum Air, where there's
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   no signal.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   I only have no signal, zero signal.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   What good is the cloud going to do me?
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   And this is going to happen once in a while.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.880]   Yeah, but you still had local storage of information, right?
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.360]   But then what do I need the cloud?
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   It's for convenience, right?
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.640]   So say you're away from your phone, or say you're on someone else's notebook, and you're
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.040]   like, "Oh, hey, I took these pictures on my phone.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.240]   I don't have to show you on the phone.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.640]   I can pull it up on my notebook or on your notebook or on your TV."
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.040]   I mean, it's just...
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.640]   That added flexibility is very nice.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.240]   Well, you argue for the cloud.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.440]   I just find it to be just something that's going to cost me more money.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   Well, I know.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   And yes, the text.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.560]   The chat room says that Dovarik hates clouds.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.120]   I don't hate clouds.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.720]   He also hates puppies, kittens.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.280]   I hate puppies.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.920]   So I wouldn't argue blindly in favor of the cloud.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.360]   I just think you have to use everything to its benefits, to its strengths.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.360]   Well, and that's the key.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.240]   Nobody's saying, "Let's replace computers with the cloud."
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   It's and.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.240]   It's another thing.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   I mean, this...
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.240]   Yes.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.240]   Exactly.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.240]   So you see, that's cloud backup.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.240]   It's backup of your data.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.040]   I mean, it's not like you give up your data.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   You still have to buy...
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   Do you really need to...
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   Backup of...
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.440]   Using the cloud for backup is fine with me.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.840]   You know, I like it.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.360]   Because you're not relying on it.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.360]   You've got it.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.400]   Here's another reason to use the cloud.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   And on...
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   You probably...
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.000]   I know, Lisa, you're the idea that you use multiple computers.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.760]   And anywhere you go, you can get your stuff is very powerful.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   It is, yeah.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.840]   The cloud didn't become a hot topic till people had more than one computer.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.400]   And I would argue actually that this idea of where to store the cloud, right?
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:11.440]   Whether it's in Google's totally selfless hands or if it's maybe a little...
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   The home data center.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.520]   The idea of your cloud is stored at your home.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.040]   And that's just like you keep your safe full of jewelry, right?
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.600]   That's where you keep your data.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   That's where I love the Pogo plug.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.120]   I mean, that's really what the Pogo plug is.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.360]   Your personal cloud.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.440]   And the one thing, of course, that we bring up once in a while when I'm getting anyone
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.160]   agreeing with me, which doesn't seem to be the case today by any means, is that you
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.840]   can get bounced from the cloud.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.760]   I mean, what if they take a dislike to you using Google's all their services and then
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.880]   somebody says, "Nah, you know what?
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   We decided you're a spammer.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.040]   You can't boom, you're dead."
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.440]   People get bounced from Facebook.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.080]   But on the other hand, it's like saying, "Well, you better not have a website because
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.640]   what if Google bounces you, you'll never...
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   Nobody will ever find you.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   I mean, it's not going to...
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.280]   It doesn't mean you're not going to use it.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.440]   Just don't rely on the 100%.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   What about my data?
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.400]   My valuable data in this cloud.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   So, let's talk about it.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.840]   So I think the point is, it's a good thing to have, but it wasn't a feature that would
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.600]   sell the phone.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:07.920]   It's ultimately, I agree with an on, that it makes sense for future phones to have this
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.400]   kind of cloud-based backup because why not?
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.800]   The bandwidth is there.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   They're already connected.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.400]   It doesn't cost anything, essentially, because data and bandwidth are both now so cheap.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.120]   But people are not going to buy the phone for that feature.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   It's just...
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   By the way, I had a reason to do that.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.200]   Call them in market, watch about this phone and Microsoft's blunders here.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.280]   You might want to look up.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   This phone had no buzz.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.960]   This thing was a disaster waiting to happen.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   It did happen.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   It took six weeks.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   Yeah, it did happen.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   What am I saying?
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.760]   It took almost no time at all.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   You used an X-S1.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   Do you like that?
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   X-S1.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   I'm a big X-S1 fan.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   Google has killed it, by the way, officially.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   They're going to stop selling it.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   Wow.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   Which...
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   The X-S2.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   Well, and then they said there wouldn't be.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.920]   There wouldn't be anything rumors that there will be a Nexus 2.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:58.440]   I think it's nice for Google to have one phone that is pure Google so that you can see
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.320]   what the other carriers and the other handset manufacturers are doing.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.400]   You know, the Motorola Blur, for instance...
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.200]   What did you like about it?
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.720]   What did I like about the Nexus 1?
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720]   It's a great phone.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720]   It's got a great screen.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.720]   I love Android.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.240]   By the way, and one of the things that happens on Android is when you log into your Google
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.760]   account on a new Android phone, it copies all your settings over.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.320]   So it does have kind of that kind of cloud backup.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.840]   So my phone, if I moved to another Android phone and immediately recognizes me and puts
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840]   all my apps on it.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:32.040]   But don't you like how hard it is to get your iPhone, new iPhone set up?
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.040]   It's part of the fun.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   I got a drag icons all over.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520]   At least they put folders.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.200]   Thank God they put folders on there.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200]   I do like widgets.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.680]   I think widgets are a very nice feature of Android.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.080]   The ability to...
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   This is typical.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   Apple says, "No, no.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   We want you have a grid of four by four icons."
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   That's it.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.840]   And with a Google phone, you can have widgets.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   You can have a weather display.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.000]   You have time to display.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.320]   And I think that's nice too, especially for...
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.960]   By the way, we had on the last cranky geeks, we had a blur on the show.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.080]   And I just had nothing but trouble trying to find it because it was...
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   Well the new...
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   My phone choice...
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   It's not a focus.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   How do they do that?
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080]   Stop it.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.000]   What was that Woody Allen movie where the guy was walking around, he's always out of focus.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.280]   There's just something wrong with him.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.960]   I can't focus on him.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.040]   I would show you this, but I don't have enough cameras, but I really like this Droid X.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.360]   And I'm going to let Lisa look at my Droid X and see what she thinks and compare it.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.360]   It's big, isn't it?
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.360]   It is big.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   Stop it, John.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   I know what you're thinking.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   I'm not saying nothing.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.920]   All right, all right, all right.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.400]   That's what she said.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.080]   Since we got Steve Gibson on, it would be important to mention the cryptographic attack against
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]   OAuth.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.920]   Now, OAuth is an authentication and open ID, authentication standards used by many websites
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.680]   and by many users for single sign-on for login.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.320]   It makes it very easy to use.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.440]   Dig uses it, Twitter uses it.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.240]   Apparently there's something called a timing attack.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.000]   You want to talk about what that is, Steve?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.560]   I'm not up to speed on that.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.920]   I know about OAuth, but I hadn't run across...
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.400]   Well it just happened a day ago, so I'm not surprised.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.080]   By submitting signatures over and over again, cycling through characters and measuring the
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.640]   time it takes for the computer to respond, hackers can figure out the correct digital
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.640]   signature.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.960]   So that's what's known as a side channel attack where as a consequence of the design
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:37.960]   of a cryptographic system, some useful information leaks out through not the actual decryption
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   or not the success of the process, but for example, the length of time it takes to compute
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.280]   and so it turns out that you have to be very careful when you design these systems that
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.840]   you're not letting any information out through so-called side channels.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.720]   So what this means is that the algorithm behaves differently even when it fails, the
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:07.040]   way it fails, like the length of time it takes to fail, gives you some information.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   And if you really clever about what you feed in, you can end up discerning the internal
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   state from the way it reacts on the outside.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.760]   And when you get the internal state, then you're able to figure out what the key is.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.000]   So that's what happened.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.400]   This we're going to hear more and more of these kinds of things because Black Hat is
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.000]   coming up later in the month in Las Vegas and of course all the hackers are getting
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.920]   their proof of concepts together.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920]   And this is one of them.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.640]   They're going to demonstrate it at Black Hat.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.160]   The researcher who came up with it said, "I really think people need to see the exploits
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.960]   of it to see that this is a problem that needs to be fixed."
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.800]   Yahoo's director of standards, Aaron Hammer, Lahav, who is contributed with both Open ID
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.480]   and OAuth said, "I'm not concerned by it.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.520]   I don't think any large provider is using any of the open source libraries for their
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.200]   server site implementation."
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   And this is most important.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.920]   It's a non-trivial attack to execute, which I guess you would agree, Steve.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.840]   Yeah, also I would wonder if it even works over the nets, for example.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   It does.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   That's interesting.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.280]   Because of something called network jitter, they've been able to demonstrate it all over
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.280]   the net.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   Very impressive then.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.520]   Because I was going to say that the uncertainty in packet transit time, you tend to lose any
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.480]   timing information if it was going through lots of router hops.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.720]   But it sounds like they've managed to null that out too.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.480]   Internet developers have long assumed there are too many other factors.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.440]   Jitter that slow down or speed up response time and make it impossible to get the kind
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.840]   of precise results for successful timing attacks.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.360]   According to Lawson, he's at root labs.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   He and Nelson tested attacks over the internet, local area networks, and in cloud computing
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.960]   environments and found they could crack passwords in all the environments by using algorithms
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.760]   to weed out jitter.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   Very impressive.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.880]   Yeah, that's some that's some hellacious work even if it's not something you could duplicate.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.480]   That's what's pretty impressive about some of these guys.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   I'll tell you.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.080]   Speaking of the iPhone, were we?
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   I think we were.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   Sam Mateo.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   When were we not?
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.680]   Well, a couple more iPhone stories and we're going to move on.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.080]   I really want to get to the old Spice guy for Lisa.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:18.880]   Sam Mateo County officials have withdrawn a search warrant issued for gizmodo.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   Remember we got all been out of shape over this.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.400]   Well, it's just like a perpetual search warrant.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.120]   This story has baffled me.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:34.440]   Jason Chen was the gizmodo reporter who had the stolen or found iPhone.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:40.080]   Authorities searched his house in April and they wanted to keep the information that they
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.320]   found on those electronic devices that they confiscated.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.640]   Chen agreed to submit information that was on those devices.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.000]   But the search warrant drew heat from critics and me and many people on this show because
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.920]   they violated shield laws that protect journalists.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:04.840]   Mr. Chen's attorney went to the district attorney saying if you agree to withdraw the search
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.600]   warrant, we will grant you access to the information you are looking for.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.400]   What does that mean?
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.120]   Well, and this is why there's a shield law because you get the computer and yeah, you're
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.400]   looking for one thing, but it could be a phishing expedition.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   You could find maybe if this is a journalist that you are targeting, you could find other
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   source information.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.200]   So the attorney said, look, you're going to have problems in court with his shield law.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.760]   Why don't we give you the information you're looking for and protect the rest of the information
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   on his system.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.880]   They said, yes, and they dropped the search warrant.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.080]   Do we have any idea what information they were looking for?
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.760]   I mean, he's basically, I mean, what kind of information could it possibly be looking
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.680]   for that would incriminate him for anything?
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.240]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   I don't know.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.880]   I would say that anybody has been charged with a crime.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.560]   This whole thing is sketchy.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.600]   I think that I think what happened is that react and the district attorney in San Mateo
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.080]   realized that they had a problem with potentially an illegal search.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.680]   So they made a good, they made a deal.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.240]   They compromised with the, with Chen's attorney.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.960]   I think this is actually good news.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.600]   It means that those shields laws do carry some weight.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.920]   And, and, and I think as Mono did the right thing, they said, look, you know, we just
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.600]   want to protect our other sources.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.640]   We'll give you the information from about this specific thing.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   Hmm.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   Hm.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   Hm.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   Hm.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   Hm.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   Hm.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   Hm.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640]   Hm.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Hm.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   Hm.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   Would you buy an Xs to John?
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   An Xs to.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   You don't buy anything.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.480]   Would you accept a Nexus to free?
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   Absolutely.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   Let's talk about the old Spice guy and more.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.520]   The channel, the Vorac.com and Steve Gibson from grc.com.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.280]   We're glad you're here today.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.560]   We're glad you're all here today.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.560]   Thank you for coming in.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.040]   Hey, can I get a plug in?
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.040]   My Twitter numbers have not gone up much because I haven't been promoting it.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.520]   So I want people to, to sign onto the real Devorac and get me, I got to get some numbers.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.520]   It's like, you take a look at it.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520]   John, how many do you have?
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   How, how great are you?
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.520]   6800 something like that.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520]   How many?
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   It's nothing.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.520]   Nothing.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.880]   I'm going to get 68,793.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.120]   Need more bikini photos.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   68,000.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.120]   Is that your secret?
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   I'm just saying.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.400]   I don't want to see John in a bikini.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.480]   I saw O'Dokta in a towel.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.440]   And I'm still suffering from that.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.200]   I don't want to see John in a bikini.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.000]   I don't either.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.360]   I think you'd look better than O'Dokta in a towel, however.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.040]   Well, and I love, and I love all of it.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.880]   So John, what is your Twitter account name?
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.120]   The real Devorac.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.560]   Oh, but make sure you're spelled Twitter right because I spelled it with two eyes and
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560]   I got a, yeah.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.560]   And you get a Parker site.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   Parker site.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   Here it is.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.560]   No, no.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.400]   No, you're, you're, you're, you know, anyway, let's talk.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.960]   No, I want to, I want to show your page.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   There it is.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   There it is.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   What is it with the clouds?
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   It's a cloud.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.800]   You got clouds on your page.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.040]   Cloud computing, baby.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   Cloud computing.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.200]   Cloud computing, John likes.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.840]   Let's see who John's following.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.240]   All, all attractive women, John.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.680]   Bobby, who's Bobby Eden?
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.280]   Oh, that's the stripper that was going to give everyone who followed her.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.880]   I got some, some oral sex.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.120]   Everland teams, why, yeah.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.840]   Hey, why not take a chance?
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.120]   What, what does it hurt?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   You asked.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.440]   Oh, I'm happy I asked.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.240]   By the way, she's got 103,000 followers.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.640]   She started with 7,000 before she made the offer.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   It worked.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   Clearly.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.320]   She is, according to her Twitter page, number one Dutch poor star.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.640]   So John, what are you going to do for your followers?
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   Exactly.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.840]   I'm going to thank them profusely.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.840]   Okay.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.240]   We've already done on the profuse.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.800]   They're going to profuse all over the fusing all over them once again.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.040]   This show, and I'm sure they're very embarrassed at this point, but they're, they're, they're
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040]   asked, what am I supposed to do?
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040]   No, I asked.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.240]   You tell the truth and that's what I love about you, John.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.200]   John offers investment device and solar companies after attending intersolar.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.040]   What, what now you're caught?
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.720]   What are you, you retweeted the guy who's mad at you.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   That's good, John.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   That's the best way to handle that, I think.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.720]   That's, it gets me those big numbers I'm looking for.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:35.840]   The real Devorak follow him and maybe Bobby will notice the real Devorak.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.840]   Actually, Bobby is the no agenda porn star girl.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.120]   So like she's on your show?
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.480]   No, she's our official porn star, but she knows you come on the show.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   Nobody comes on the show.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.840]   It's not a show with that has anything other than two guys.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   You're hacking.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.280]   Well, there's your problem.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.640]   This show brought to you by squarespace.com.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.440]   You see, they just got an influx of some money.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.440]   Yeah, that's money.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.080]   Big 38 million, I think venture capital.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.000]   That's really fantastic.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.360]   They are once again, just the place to go.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.520]   If you want to build a new website, if you go to squarespace.com/twit, you can try it
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.280]   for a 15 days free.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.480]   You don't even need a credit card.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.280]   And if you decide to buy, use the coupon code TWIT and you get 10% off for the rest
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.840]   of your life forever, which is great.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.200]   And it's very affordable anyway.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:31.600]   They started $8 a month for both hosting and I think absolutely the best content management
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.920]   system out there.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.680]   You get these great templates that don't look like templates and then you can customize
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.440]   them to make your site look unique.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.480]   They've got incredible statistics and content management.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.560]   Talk about cloud hosting.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:52.560]   They are using some very sophisticated Java, a VPS technology that gives you instant scaling
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.840]   and great photographers as well.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.840]   Are you using them?
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.840]   No, I'm not.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:57.840]   But I, yeah.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   Why not?
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   We got to get you on squarespace.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.640]   Yeah, I'm on WordPress and I've been on them for ages.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.760]   I think squarespace needs to reach out to WordPress users because squares, people, you
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.200]   know, I, squares, everybody knows WordPress.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.920]   I've been around for ages.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.840]   Now that squarespace has a little money, I think that they should reach out because
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.560]   this is a modern platform in ways that WordPress absolutely is.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.880]   Well, now that I, I mean, I have my, my blog and then I have my portfolio and you know,
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.480]   I'm getting, look at the, go to squarespace.com, look at the examples page and then click portfolios.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.040]   Yeah, because I mean, I need a portfolio that can be viewed on an iPad and iPhone.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.040]   Right.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.560]   It needs to be mobile and right now the site that I have is Flash and, you know, it's
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560]   not good.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560]   It's not good.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.160]   Squarespace is just beautiful stuff that doesn't look templated.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.320]   That's what one of the things I like about it.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.800]   You can't tell it's squarespace.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.880]   That's not normally a selling point.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   But in fact, I think it is.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.920]   Word plus blogs tend to look like WordPress blogs, you know, you can kind of, oh yeah,
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.080]   I've seen it seamless importing of all your content from WordPress or moveable type or
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.600]   type add or blogger and out too.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600]   So you're not stuck.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.920]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.080]   There's a great iPhone app.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.320]   You'll love that.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.800]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.140]   Give it a try.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.560]   They really do great stuff.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.800]   And we do our inside twit blog on there.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.560]   We use Drupal for our big site because we have all these elaborate things.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.640]   And now I'm starting to wish I'd use Squarespace because it costs a lot of money for development
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.880]   and customization and it takes, there's delays and it's just, you know, it'd be so much
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   easier.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.160]   Oh, well.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.000]   So what do you think of this?
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.600]   I thought this was a really smart campaign on those spices part.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:43.560]   Oh, it's definitely the best interactive web based advertising that we've seen.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.760]   So we've talked before about the old spice ad I'm on a horse, which I love.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.240]   It's like one of the swan dive.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.280]   Well, and then there was a sequel swan dive came out a couple of weeks ago.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.800]   Weeding in Kennedy, the agency that did this just brilliant.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.240]   In fact, we did a video dissecting the I'm on a horse, how they did it piece by piece
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.400]   with the creatives.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.800]   I'm catching up with your Barney video, John.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.680]   I've almost got a million views on that.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   Oh, really?
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.040]   You better get another Barney video.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:15.480]   Go to the Dvork and censored on YouTube and watch Barney.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.880]   That's this is your marketing strategy.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   Yes.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:25.400]   So what old spice did is they got Isaiah, I can remember his last name, Mustafa, and
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.160]   he's a football player, really hunky guy, right?
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.120]   And they got him in and I think they must have just sat there and studio and watched
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.360]   people tweet him.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.560]   Well, it looks like they had him in studio for about two or three days and they were
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.120]   watching any sort of at tweets and they would actually do a video reply.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   Right.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.280]   And if you go through, I mean, there's like hundreds of them and there's like, you know,
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.720]   Kevin Rose and we talked about that last week because we know Kevin and he kind of said,
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.960]   get well, Kevin, but I, but there was a wedding proposal there.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.920]   Oh, you know, Lisa Milano have been going back and back back and forth.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   I mean, it's so smart.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   I mean, it's the engagement factor that really has made this as popular it is.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.000]   Isaiah Mustafa.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.840]   His daughter, Haley, Santa, my Twitter saying, why is it you look so much like my dad?
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   Like my dad.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:24.280]   Well, Haley, the truth is scientists have discovered that there's a parallel universe
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.040]   and your father must live in that universe that parallel to mine.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.880]   Unfortunately, I happen to be more successful, well known and richer than your dad.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.800]   So just because I'm so rich, don't expect your father to be rich because he's probably
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.880]   a struggling actor who no one has ever heard of.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.080]   So you'll have to keep playing with those old toys.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.720]   But if I were you, dad, I'd buy you anything your heart desires.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.720]   You deserve it, monkey.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   Oh, that kind of sweet.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.000]   So comes up with that on the fly.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.560]   Well, I obviously they have a team of copywriters sitting there.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Yeah, it's a writing, such smart writing.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.120]   There's the, let me see if I can find the marriage proposal because that is, that is
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   really good.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.120]   This is, this is how you, this is how you do a viral marketing, right?
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.240]   Even did Reddit did, did one where they, he gave them sort of an answering machine.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.680]   So you could just like piece together all the different numbers and create your own message
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   on your phone.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   Really?
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   So you could do an old spice.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   You could do.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:32.840]   So why does this work with so many other social media efforts by big companies just are terrible.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:39.440]   But I mean, obviously being successful on YouTube is huge, but also just the, like I
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.320]   said before, like the engagement factor that people are engaging in this and then you get
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.960]   all the retweets, then you got all the people on YouTube talking about it.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.800]   And I mean, it's just, and the right.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.520]   I have a thought on this too.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.520]   Okay.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.920]   Go ahead, John.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.280]   Every one of these things that's worked has a sense of humor.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280]   Yes, funny.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.800]   It's got to be funny first.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.120]   And all the ones that are serious never work.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   That's my thoughts for them.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.120]   That's good.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.120]   Thank you.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.120]   I'll be here all the week.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.120]   I'll give you another shot in a second.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   Right.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.120]   Like just say again.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.520]   They're not trying to push anything on you.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520]   That's what you know what?
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.720]   It's there you go.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.000]   They never mentioned old spice in these things.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   Well, they do a little.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   Well, they do.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.160]   I mean, he's saying, but in a very tongue and cheek way.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   Here's the marriage proposal.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.960]   I can play it.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.440]   On Twitter, J.S. Beals tweets.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.880]   Can you ask my girlfriend to marry me?
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.280]   Her name is Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.960]   J.S. Beals.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.320]   Thank you for your tweet.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.760]   And I'd be honored to honorably honor your honorable request.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.240]   Miss Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain, it seems like yesterday that you met J.S. Beals.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.400]   But your love is blossomed from a seed into a fully grown love plant.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.960]   Now it's time to fertilize that plant.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.000]   This is part I like the lights, dim.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.920]   Well, you make J.S. Beals the happiest man in the world and marry him in real life.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.440]   The candles roll back out.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   The lights come back up.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.840]   It'll be eagerly awaiting your reply.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.840]   Eagerly.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.960]   E. It's really good creative, Leo.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   It's really good.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   It's good writing.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   Good writing.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   That's what makes it go.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.560]   And of course we're playing it.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.520]   Everybody, I'm sure retweeting it and sending it to friends.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.960]   By the way, she said yes.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960]   Oh, nice.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.520]   Would that work for you?
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520]   I wonder.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   I think it's...
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   Eagerly not.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520]   I think...
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.120]   Well, I remember reading, you know, sometimes people call the sports events.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.440]   They call the scoreboard and they say, "Would you put the merit proposal up on the scoreboard?"
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.760]   And I was reading, I think it was at Yankee Stadium, the scoreboard people say, "Yeah,
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.360]   we get two or three a week last minute.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   Stop the proposal.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   Please don't do it.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   Whatever.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.360]   Oh my God.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.720]   I've made a horrible mistake."
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720]   I sobered up.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.720]   I sobered up.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.200]   That's probably what it is.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.920]   Anyway, so I think success and congratulations to Isaiah Mustafa, who has now been on every
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.120]   TV show and he's probably got a great career ahead of him.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.160]   And again, credit to really the creative behind this at Weeden in Kennedy because they
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.000]   did a great job.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.360]   I'd be interesting to know how it's converting to sales of Old Spice rather than just...
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.840]   Ah, very good point.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:42.280]   The Old Spice YouTube channel has 75 million total views, 75 million.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.320]   Now, how much do you pay for an ad on the Super Bowl?
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.240]   A lot more for a lot less, right?
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:55.560]   Let me see if they say there's any figures on sales.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.640]   Sometimes these commercials are so good and so clever that you completely lose track
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.520]   of or if they can indicate what it is they're selling.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.120]   You're just transfixed by how fun they are.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.360]   It's like, "Okay, what was that commercial for?"
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.280]   Well, an old doctor makes an interesting point.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.320]   He says, "Nobody uses Old Spice."
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.200]   This is like grandpa's aftershave.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:23.680]   But if you compare it to, say, Axe, that's really prevalent, it's really out there and
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.560]   it's sort of like right there when you walk in the supermarket.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:31.000]   People are all about Axe and they're sort of ad campaign.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.800]   I mean, it is possible that people could sort of switch to something.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.360]   Because they're like, "Oh, the Old Spice guy, he's so cool."
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.360]   Right.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360]   And then they smell it.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.280]   Hold on, does anyone actually think the Axe guys are cool?
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.320]   I just thought that was just a big joke.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.480]   Yeah, you know who does my 15-year-old son?
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.800]   It's not aimed at anybody over 13 or 14.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.040]   That was my very last audition that I went to.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.280]   You went to an Axe audition?
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280]   Yes.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   That was it.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   That was it.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   That was it.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   That was it.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   That was it.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280]   What was that?
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280]   Oh, gosh.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.280]   I can't even remember.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   Maybe three years ago.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.280]   And I walked in.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.680]   And it was a group of girls and they're like, "Okay, we're going to pretend that this Axe
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:17.120]   is like, you know, it's like raining Axe and you get really, really horny and you watch
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.520]   these two dogs having sex and you really turned on by that."
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.520]   Oh, dear.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   Wow.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   And that's when I walked out.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520]   You actually walked out?
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520]   Good to see you.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.520]   Good to see you.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   I have a master's degree.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.520]   Why am I here?
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.160]   I am not going to watch that.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.760]   Dogs fornicating.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.480]   So in comparison to...
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.680]   Did they actually have dogs or was you supposed to imagine that?
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.720]   No, it was all in our imagination.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   Oh, gosh.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   So yeah.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.880]   But that, I mean, compared to that kind of advertising, like, you know, the old Spice
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.280]   guy will carry a lot more weight.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   I think...
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   There's a...
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   Hey Leo.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.920]   You remember a high karate and English leather?
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.920]   Same thing, the high karate.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.920]   Okay.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   English leather.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.600]   Wasn't that the one that said all my men wear English leather?
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.280]   Oh, they wear nothing at all.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280]   Yes.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.160]   And then the karate, the guy had to chop...
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.160]   He had to do karate with women.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   He had to do karate with women.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.160]   We had a bunch of bruisers.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.160]   Women were attacking.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   No, bruisers.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.160]   Women, they were attacking.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.160]   Oh, it's women attacking.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.160]   That's where the ax thing comes from.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.160]   And ax is just...
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   I don't know what the point was ax.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.000]   It's high karate all over again.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.600]   But the thing I will underscore in every single one of these, and Lisa, correct me if
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.840]   I'm wrong, they all smell horrible.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.440]   You don't want a guy to smell like that.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.000]   Well, I mean, old Spice smells like my high school boyfriend.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.240]   That's the only thing that could make old Spice is a little bit of nostalgia, right?
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.720]   It's because he was 15.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.120]   He had a buck 50 to spend on aftershave and no taste.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.920]   No, he used his dad's.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.920]   He used his dad's.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920]   Smells like grandpa.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.680]   Smells like grandpa.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   So this is...
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.880]   I think you made a really good point.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.560]   Does this sell more old Spice, or does it just make the brand hip with no actual benefit
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.560]   to the brand?
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.200]   Well, I mean, brand recognition is huge.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.120]   And I think eventually it does translate.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   And if it's...
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.000]   If something's a crappy product, it's not going to save it.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   But we will remember.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.880]   It's the old Spice guys.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.520]   We've already bought that.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]   That's one...
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.080]   You know who's the winner here?
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.320]   Isaiah Mustafa.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.320]   Yes.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   Nobody else.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   I don't think old Spice sells more...
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320]   I don't know.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.280]   I wonder about the winner, old Spice.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.640]   I wonder if it's been reformulated because I remember when I was a kid.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.640]   And then I remember the smell of it.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.120]   It smelled like blackjack gum when I was a kid.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.120]   No, it smells like...
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   Smelly lashes in turpentine.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]   It was great.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.760]   No, it smells like gin.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760]   Really cheap gin.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.600]   I mean, old Spice also does have a very extensive deodorant line too, right?
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.800]   So it's...
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.240]   And not to sound like a deodorant reviewer or anything, but that is a big part of it too.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.240]   I think it's made with gin.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240]   I think it's made with gin.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.240]   The chat room used the deodorant.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.120]   Wait a minute, Steve just said something.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   Say that again.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120]   I think it's made with gin.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   I think so.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.200]   I hope that might be a little pricey.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.080]   But it is a good name for the show.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.240]   It's made with gin.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.920]   Facebook reaches half a billion users.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.080]   It finally happens.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   Wow.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.080]   The...
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.600]   There seemed to be a little bit of a slowdown enough take among certain groups, men 18 to
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.360]   34 in the US and so forth.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:22.440]   But Facebook is now starting to beat Orkut in India, which is where Google had two strongholds,
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.880]   Brazil and India for its failed social media network.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   Facebook's even beaten them in India now apparently.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.400]   They're coming on strong.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.560]   Half a billion.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.560]   They're now...
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.720]   Okay, to put this in perspective, there are now more Facebook users than Windows 7 licenses.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.320]   There are more Facebook users than the number of people in the entire United States.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.560]   There are more Facebook users than the number of daily Twitter posts.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.560]   There is a Facebook movie.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560]   Oh, I want to see that too.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   I don't know.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.560]   I see that.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.560]   The accidental billionaires.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   When's that out?
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]   Creepy Zuckerberg.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.560]   When do we think Google me is going to happen?
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.680]   You know, all evidence points to soon.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.160]   Google says it's announcing its music service this summer.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.560]   That could be what?
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.120]   And through September 21st or something.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.280]   And I think Google's going to make a big push along these lines.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.960]   I really do.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.120]   But can it win over?
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.240]   I mean, if everybody's on Facebook, why would you go anywhere else?
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.680]   Right, you're in that network.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.160]   It's beyond critical mass.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.000]   It's just rolling out.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.680]   And this is the audience that I was talking before that has no technology or computer
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.760]   knowledge, but they want to play Farmville and they want to.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.800]   They want to catch up with their high school sweethearts.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.560]   They want to hook up with their former employees.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560]   You know, co-employees.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   That kind of thing.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.880]   I think that that's being used for business a lot now too.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.120]   I see Facebook being mentioned on corporate sites and corporate flyers and things all
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   the place.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.800]   That's that old spice thing trying to be hip, right?
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800]   Look at LinkedIn and where LinkedIn.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.880]   I mean, LinkedIn used to be the sort of business.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.880]   Right.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.080]   And Facebook was like where you put your embarrassing junk photos.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:15.800]   And now it's like, you know, LinkedIn sort of fallen off and it's all about Facebook and
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.800]   people.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.000]   I'm waiting to feel out of touch because I don't have a Facebook account.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   You know, I killed my--
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   And I'm just waiting to see.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.960]   You can start over to Marlio.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.720]   You'd have your old numbers back about a week.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.960]   But then wouldn't that be kind of embarrassing to say, oh, I can't back?
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.160]   No, you have to stay off it now.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]   You've seen it.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   You have to put your stake in the ground.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160]   I can't go.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.640]   I mean, I have my tail between my legs.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   I can't.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   Do you miss it, Leo?
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.480]   Was it doing something for you that you really feel like you don't have now?
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   No, I don't.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.480]   Well, that's interesting question.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.920]   In fact, when you do delete your Facebook account, you get this row of people's pictures
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.440]   randomly chosen from your followers saying, Lisa Bettany is going to miss you.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.840]   Your mother's going to miss you.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.720]   So there's this big guilt trip they lay on you.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.360]   I don't miss using it.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.360]   No.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.080]   And I don't feel like I'm in any lesson touch with Lisa because I don't see your Facebook
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.080]   posts.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.200]   I do feel like I'm less in touch with some people than I don't really care about.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   But if you really care about that.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.280]   Yeah, I mean, ultimately, like for me, the people that I'm closest to, I still call and
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.520]   like see on a regular basis, right?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:23.280]   And because Facebook is so public, but I mean, I do have to be a censored version of my
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.360]   self there simply because it, I mean, that's the way you deal with the privacy issues.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.320]   I'm willing to bet everybody here uses Facebook not personally, but as a marketing tool, as
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.160]   a publicity tool, as a, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   Yeah, but I'm also, I'm also at the point where I don't call people.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.960]   I don't see people in real life.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.840]   All my friends are on the internet.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.400]   Like I don't, I mean, somebody said that.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.000]   So you don't have like one person that you've known all your life that you do.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.280]   You do pick up the phone and call.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.360]   You don't have like that one or those one or two people.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.800]   She's left broken hearts strewn behind her.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:06.600]   I like, I like being in my, my little world where I'm in my dinosaur pajamas and I'm
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.280]   in my little safe place and I'm just communicating via the internet.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.800]   So you like Facebook because it lets you wear dinosaur pajamas.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.800]   And it is successful.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.840]   You don't have to have a outward face.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:19.840]   So you use it personally.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.960]   And on it sounds like you use it professionally, mostly.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.640]   No, I use it for both.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.280]   But the thing is that like, so I've got readers, manufacturers, and, you know, my actual friends,
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.520]   as friends of on Facebook.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.840]   But I do the same thing when I'm out, like having dinner with, you know, if you and I
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.640]   were have dinner somewhere, I'd still watch what I said because I don't know who's around.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.800]   But you and I might planned dinner on Facebook.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   Yes.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   That's true.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   If we wanted to make everyone else feel really awkward for not being invited.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   Right.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.040]   John, John, what do you think?
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.080]   You were poo pooing all this?
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.360]   No, I mean, I think Facebook serves a purpose.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.880]   I think a lot of people find it useful.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.200]   I just have not.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.520]   I mean, I subscribe to certain things and I get on board with this and that.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.840]   And once in a while you say something.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.840]   I said, well, that's a good idea.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.320]   I'll give it a shot because you're always you.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.000]   Yeah, that's what I miss is that kind of chance.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.760]   But I use Twitter that way a little bit.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.480]   I use Twitter to get some some information back and forth.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.120]   I use LinkedIn.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.720]   The rest of the stuff I haven't been using.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.640]   I've been thinking about four square and whirl I'm probably going to play with because the
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.480]   CEO is an interesting character.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.480]   Whirls kind of neat.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   I've played with it a little bit.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.240]   It's just like Facebook is just like another thing to do.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.600]   And then I say, and then they say it's addictive for women mostly.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.320]   And I see my wife and daughter and they're on this thing all the time.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.040]   I don't want to be like that.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.800]   It's just it's too big of an opportunity in the marketing.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.680]   I mean, that's that's what I think is that what that's the one.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.480]   I've noticed that it varies depending on what you do.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.120]   So you're a photographer?
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   Yes.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.920]   And so it actually works really, really well for photographers.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.720]   And that's one thing I've seen.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.200]   From my perspective, I don't know.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.080]   It's like it's a great way to stalk people.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.080]   Right?
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:05.840]   Like that's the number one thing I see people doing is just learning information about other
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.920]   people that they don't really have the means to get any other way.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.400]   That's true.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.360]   And in terms of whether or not like Google's attempt is going to do anything to it.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.120]   Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's the same thing for any market.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.120]   Right?
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.280]   Market share is gained in lost in periods of transition.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.040]   There's no real transition right now for social networking.
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.720]   So I think things are going to stay the way they are until that next big idea comes forward.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:33.440]   And generally speaking, new companies and smaller companies are ones to kind of get
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.600]   on board with new ideas before the established players.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.560]   And I think that's the only time we'll see a change in market share.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:47.760]   Google just acquired a company this week called MetaWeb, which is a search engine that they
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:52.520]   say connects data in more meaningful ways than just links.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.640]   And some have said that the reason Google wants them, they obviously have a very competent
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:01.560]   search engine, but they want to get smarter about the results they're turning in.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:06.380]   And frankly, it's being John Miller writing a PC world says this is actually going right
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:07.440]   up against Facebook.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:13.520]   This is part of Google's attempt to continue to keep their dominance against Facebook,
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.760]   because Facebook combined in the social graph with search results gives you all of this deep,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.560]   rich information.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.400]   And Google's afraid it cannot do that.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:26.080]   Google said we've acquired MetaWeb, a company that maintains an open database of things in
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.080]   the world.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.680]   Working together, we want to improve search and make the web richer and more meaningful
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:36.320]   for everyone, which is the kind of silly rhetoric that Mark Zuckerberg has used about Facebook.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:40.120]   Well, think of all the data they're amassing.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.440]   Facebook has more data.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.440]   It's ridiculous.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.640]   And that translates to a lot of money.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.640]   Right.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.640]   Potentially.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.120]   If they can convince users that it's okay to reveal this information.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.480]   Is Google able to index into Facebook?
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.480]   No.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.760]   Because non-Facebook users are not able to see Facebook pages, right?
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.120]   You have to join in order to be part of the network.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   Right.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   That's an advantage.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.720]   Because they have information that Google can't get.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.280]   Uh, WikiLeaks is in the news.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.840]   Of course, the US government would love to, uh, love to get the guy who started WikiLeaks.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.760]   Especially bull, especially since it released that secret video of the, uh, US airstrike
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:25.760]   in Iraq.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:34.600]   The site's founder, Julianna Sanghay made a rare public appearance at Ted, Ted Global.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.560]   He said, we're overwhelmed by our growth.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:40.000]   The site can't keep up with the volume of new material because it doesn't have enough
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.520]   people to verify it.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.800]   He says the attention that WikiLeaks gotten has helped it because people are just great.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.680]   I found a place to give this information to.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.680]   CIA honey pot.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   CIA honey pot.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.680]   Hello.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.680]   Really?
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   Hello.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:57.680]   Really?
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:02.120]   So you're saying don't give information to, well, if you do anonymize it, I guess.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:09.240]   If it goes through a tour network or something, but then again, um, I ran across a rumor
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:12.400]   about a month ago, which I was never able to pursue.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:17.960]   It didn't really spend that much time, but the rumor was that WikiLeaks was formed by
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:24.400]   monitoring a tour exit node and capturing documents that were coming out of a tour anonymizing
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   system.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.280]   So I think we got to look more into this Julianna Sanghay.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.280]   Interesting.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280]   Mm.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.280]   I don't know.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.760]   I think WikiLeaks is actually fantastic.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.240]   Don't you seems like a very good thing.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.240]   It's like a pro event sort of thing.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.520]   And I think a Sanghay deserves a lot of credit.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.960]   WikiLeaks operates out of Iceland and Sweden among other places.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:48.960]   He cannot come to the US.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.440]   In fact, he's had to cancel three public appearances in the US, including one in June
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:59.080]   at the conference of investigative reporters and editors in Las Vegas because of his fear
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.120]   of the US authorities.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.880]   I don't think it's a CIA, John, unless they've got, they've really gotten clever.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   And there's gotten clever.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.880]   I think there's no evidence.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.880]   So they do.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880]   Is there clever?
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:11.880]   Clever?
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.880]   That's what they did.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.880]   Have you written legacy of ashes?
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:14.880]   Really?
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.880]   Clever?
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.880]   I'm totally suspicious too.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.360]   Well, I'm getting some bone head and things they've done, but the, I'm not, well, I'm
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.000]   not, I'm just not buying it.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.200]   There's the whole, there's the whole story, the whole backstory behind that operation is
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.200]   just fascinating.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.600]   That's just doesn't sound right.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.600]   I love it.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.360]   I love your conspiracy minded theories.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.040]   It's not, it's not a conspiracy.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.760]   Some guys weren't for the, what's the conspiracy?
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.280]   I mean, it's just a, you know, a business.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.680]   You thought you thought Facebook was a CIA honeypot.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.800]   I think Facebook might be Facebook.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.840]   Well, we know Facebook has an investment from the CIA's venture farm.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840]   Exactly.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.920]   And you don't think they're investing in then saying, well, whatever you guys want to do,
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.920]   just go do it.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.480]   You know, we'll cash in later.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:59.280]   There's no, you know, but chat room says I'm naive because I don't believe it.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.280]   I'm just naive.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.560]   A whole bunch of people are saying that shut down the chat room immediately.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   I'm sweet innocent.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   Do your Nixon.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560]   I'm going to get back to that.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:15.360]   I'm going to wear my dinosaur, but drama, a dualist commercial and dinosaur chamois.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.400]   It's time very quickly to talk about go to meeting from our friends at Citrix, the affordable
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.320]   way to meet with clients and colleagues.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.760]   Look, a business trip, it's ridiculous.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.440]   A thousand dollars, according to America Express, the average cost of a business trip.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.800]   I used to fly up to Vancouver.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.760]   You'd stay at the beautiful Opus Hotel.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.400]   You'd have lovely flights on Virgin America.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.080]   I would just, it would be fabulous, but a thousand dollars later, whereas for $49 a month,
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.240]   you have as many meetings as you want.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.800]   As long as you want, as often as you want up to 15 people at the same time, you show
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.400]   them what's on your computer.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.000]   They can show you what's on their computer.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.360]   You can pass control around.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.360]   You can collaborate together on the same document.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.360]   Go to meetings.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:59.040]   If you are still traveling for business or perhaps even worse spending time on conference
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.920]   calls, which has to be the single most painful thing ever, try go to meeting.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:10.160]   You try it free right now by going to go to meeting.com/twit30daysfree.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.160]   Go to meeting.com/twitplease.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.160]   Do me a favor.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.480]   Give it a try.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.760]   You will, I think, love it and it's how we do all our meetings.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.120]   In fact, if I could figure out a way to do twit with go to meeting, you'd probably like
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.120]   that.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.360]   At least you wouldn't have to go through all that traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.800]   But then I wouldn't get to see you.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:33.680]   When Lisa's here, I feel like I'm on my own private version of the holodeck.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.560]   John, was that a duck call?
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.040]   Do you actually have a duck call?
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.040]   I do.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:46.120]   A real one too, an acme, which is one of the world's great duck calls.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.520]   This show brought to you by one of the world's great duck calls.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:52.920]   Now, by the way, these things are very handy to see the acme duck call in Made in England.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.560]   These things are quite handy in a theater during when they're showing something very
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.880]   serious and it's like it starts getting pretty bad.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.280]   You just let the duck call loose and you get a huge laugh.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.840]   You can't lose.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.800]   It's a guaranteed laugh.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.840]   I wish I'd had a dream.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.480]   I went to see Adam Sandler's grownups.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:10.480]   Do not go see that movie.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.560]   There's not a laugh in the whole movie and I could have used that duck call a couple of
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560]   times.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.880]   Lisa, so you play with the Dred X?
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.480]   It's a too big for you?
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:20.680]   I don't know if this can fit in my back pocket.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.680]   Yeah, maybe not.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.480]   The way I'd like it to.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.160]   You don't want to sit in a phone though.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.400]   Really, you would put your phone in the back pocket?
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.880]   Well, I'm not a very good girl.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:35.520]   I finally got a purse, like an actual girl purse because before I was just carrying my
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.480]   camera and my camera bag.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.120]   So I got a girl purse so I can go off.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.480]   You know, come to think I have never seen you carry a purse.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.480]   I know.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.480]   I didn't think about that.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.840]   You guys are men carry the purse.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   I carry a purse.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.240]   So I guess I'm a very good girl.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.680]   That's a MERSH though, I think.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   It's a MERSH.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.720]   So by the way, I put my E71 milk in my back pocket too and sit on it constantly.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   Do you?
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.560]   Not only is it bad for the phone, but I think it could cause sciatica.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.120]   Oh, maybe, maybe.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.680]   I haven't used the word sciatica since I used old Spice.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.400]   I feel like I'm grandpa.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:18.520]   Actually, you know, old Spice Mentos comes to mind.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.520]   Remember Mentos?
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.240]   This was Grandma's Mint until they started advertising on MTV.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.240]   That's true.
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.240]   And then it became hip.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.240]   The Fresh Maker.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.480]   Oh, and then they, but they did the Coke, the Pepsi.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.120]   And then they put it in Pepsi and became even Hipper.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.480]   But, but have you ever eaten the Mentos?
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.880]   No, they're horrible.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]   I love them.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.520]   They're not that bad.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.520]   I like them.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.520]   They're chewy mint.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.520]   I predict.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:48.320]   I predict a resurgence of old Spice based on this small sampling of consumers who think
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.800]   Mentos is hip.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.560]   No, I said it was hip.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.560]   They were just chewy and tasty.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560]   Delicious.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:58.960]   I never got the whole like mint as some sort of a refreshing candy thing.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.920]   It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.920]   Really?
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.560]   Yeah, you know, I just, I need it for mint purposes, right?
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.080]   I don't need it for like any other purpose.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.200]   I actually want it.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.800]   I want to ask you, and maybe that's cultural and on.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.240]   Did you, did you grow up in the States or did you grow up in India?
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.600]   No, I grew up in Massachusetts.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.920]   Actually, only my dad's Indian.
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.920]   My mom's Iranian.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920]   Oh, interesting.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.120]   I was curious, you know, if you have Indian in you, it just it kind of takes over any
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.120]   other race.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.000]   Well, the name is what made me think you were in.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:37.960]   There is a quite a controversy about this iPhone app that is an ad for a skin product that
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:45.080]   is sold Vaseline face whitening that is sold in India to literally whiten your skin.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:51.480]   And they made an iPhone app of that of this, which is kind of controversial.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.120]   What's the app do?
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.920]   Yeah, you transform your face.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   It whitens you.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920]   Well, it shows you.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:57.920]   Well, it shows you.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.480]   You look like I was just in India back in December and you know, it's, it's funny.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.560]   It's like human nature, right?
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.120]   You always want what you don't have.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.360]   And so everyone here wants to be tan and everyone over there just wants to be like
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.720]   billboards, right of creams and stuff like that that'll lighten your skin.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.200]   It's just like, I mean, humans are weird creatures, man.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.440]   They just ultimately wanted a similar product in Japan.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:25.840]   We risk cancer to look more like you and then but go to India and they and they want
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.240]   this.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.120]   There's a Vaseline men be prepared page.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.520]   That's a there's a Facebook app.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.000]   I thought it was an iPhone app Facebook app, which will whiten your profile image permanently,
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   I guess permanently.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.560]   Yeah, it's the Michael Jackson sense at all.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.360]   Well, you know what, John?
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.480]   You're not alone because a Wall Street Journal reporter tested the Vaseline skin whitening
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:54.640]   Facebook app and remained unconvinced of its result.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:59.120]   Now that's hard hitting journalism.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.120]   Thank goodness.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.360]   All right, I don't know.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   I just thought I'd bring that up.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.680]   I don't know if there's a story that I've not killed the show.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.680]   I know.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.960]   Maybe I should just go home now.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.200]   I got nothing else to say.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.360]   Anybody else have anything you're talking about?
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.640]   You killed the show, Leo.
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.800]   I literally killed the show.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.960]   Well, it's five o'clock.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.960]   It's time to go home.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.120]   Oh, so it is.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]   So it is.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120]   So it is.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.560]   John C. Devorek is at channel Devorek.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560]   That's the place to go.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.720]   If you'd like to see what John's been up to and he's been up to a lot, mostly no good.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720]   Well, there's a lot.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.240]   I still didn't get to my 69,000 followers with the show here.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.240]   Damn.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.240]   All right.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.240]   Last chance.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240]   We can't stop the show.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240]   It's only live.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240]   Wait till the thing airs.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.080]   When this thing goes, airs will 300,000 people are going to hear it and they're all going
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.480]   to start following you, John.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480]   You know what I like though?
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.720]   I really like the idea of holding this show hostage.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   Like we're going to stay on the air until John.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.920]   How many do you want, John?
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.920]   I need only 60 more, 59 more people.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.160]   I'll be at 69,000.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.280]   That's all I wanted to get to today.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.280]   You just, well, that's easy.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   Jack room.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280]   The real Devorek.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.280]   All right.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   Let's see.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.440]   You have 68,943, 57 people.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.440]   That's all we need.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.200]   Get those phones ringing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:18.040]   We're going to stay on the air until John C. Devorek has 69,000.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.040]   Thank God.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.040]   You didn't say 70.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.040]   69,000 followers.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.760]   All right, everybody, please go to, you know, the problem, John Partley is you've probably
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.120]   saturated the Twitter audience.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.120]   I think so.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.560]   There's, you know, you have a lot of shows.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.560]   That's the, yeah.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560]   We're at 68,956.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.640]   Let's roll that tote board and see.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.400]   Like Jerry, do Jerry Lewis.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.640]   ♪ You'll never walk alone ♪
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.200]   ♪ John, we love you ♪
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.000]   ♪ I want to tell you this man, this man, this John C. Devorek, this man, he does this for love ♪
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.600]   And now it is ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   We have 69,000 and nine.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.600]   There we go.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.600]   Thank you very much.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:58.600]   Thank you very much.
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.600]   I'll be here all the week.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600]   God, we can't sell this show.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.600]   Oh, man.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.960]   I thought we were going to be here all night.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.240]   Lisa Bettany is at mostly Lisa.com.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.720]   That's where you go to find her photography.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.760]   Now that you're moving to the Bay Area, I know that Alex Lindsey and I are both fighting
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:12.880]   over you.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.360]   We both want you to do shows for us.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.360]   Oh.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.720]   I'd love a photography show with you.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   I would love to do a dot-dot-dot-dot-show.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.680]   And I'm sure John, I mean, Alex has probably already come to you.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   Can I put my plug in?
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.520]   What's your plug?
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   Congratulations.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.520]   Wow, that was a big story that I completely forgot.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.520]   Camera plus.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:29.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.520]   Now tell us about this.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.040]   It said you made like $150,000 in the first month.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.480]   A bit more than that.
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:36.640]   You're kidding me.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.920]   But now, was that the giveaway you think to put that over the top?
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.080]   Well, I mean, the app is great.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.760]   So I think it just sort of, I mean, obviously there's the marketing power behind tap, tap,
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:48.760]   tap.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.760]   They're amazing.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.760]   And they've made great apps.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.240]   There's that behind it.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.840]   And I think just a lot of people are sharing the photos.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.640]   Obviously, my great effects.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.400]   So it's $1.99 and you sold like $200,000 worth.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Well, how many?
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.920]   I mean, I think we've done a quarter of a million.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:08.920]   In the first month.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:09.920]   Yes.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.920]   Holy cow.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.160]   So I think I should get a job with you.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.880]   Forget you'd get a job with me.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:22.680]   I mean, this is this, I haven't got the money yet, but it will certainly change my life.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.680]   It will.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.680]   That's great.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.680]   That's why you, that's why you and Peter buying a house.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.960]   So you know, it can be a girl house.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.040]   Camera plus the ultimate photo app.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.400]   Go to C-A-M-E-R-A-P-L dot U-S.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.800]   Wait a minute, why am I looking at John C. de Vorac when I could be looking at Lisa?
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:38.800]   There you go.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   Better idea.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   It's the duck call.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.800]   The duck calls us.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.280]   The duck is calling me.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.000]   I just ordered one online, by the way.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.560]   Did you realize I'm on Haslam?
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.160]   Did you really need a duck call?
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   Wow.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160]   Oh, they do.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160]   Good.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.160]   But you should order Lisa's product.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.680]   People have to realize that this woman is really an outstanding photographer.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   She really is.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.680]   She's amazing.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:00.680]   I really love this stuff.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.000]   And she needs to probably become better known as sex.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.560]   Hi, I'm Lisa Bettany.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.680]   As a photographer, I'm passionate about one thing, capturing moments.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.680]   And my dinosaur gene.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.480]   Literally I've noticed that some of my best shots aren't taken with my expensive DSLR,
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.480]   but with my iPhone.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.520]   So this is an I can't stop working with tech.
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:19.520]   I can't stop.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.520]   I can't stop.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.520]   Sorry.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.520]   I'm just scrolling.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:27.200]   If you want to see more of Lisa Bettany, camera plus C-A-M-E-R-A-P-L dot US or go to her
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.200]   website, must leave at least.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.240]   I'm sure you have a plug on mostly Lisa, right?
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240]   Yeah, mostly Lisa.

[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.240]   A little bit.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.800]   It's great to see you.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.800]   Thank you, Steve Gibson.

[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.440]   Yeah, Friday.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.440]   No, Thursday.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.440]   Thursday's on the Twit Network.

[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:03.880]   Oh, you know, I suppose we've got to go late in plugs.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:07.400]   I suppose we've got to go through everybody's Twitter account.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.400]   Do you know what?
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:13.000]   This is a big deal, John, because Steve was like the last Twitter holdout.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.080]   Now it's Jerry who's the last Twitter holdout.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.320]   Did Jerry start one?
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   I don't know.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.600]   Jerry can get big numbers pretty quick.

[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.000]   What is your goal?
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000]   What is your goal?
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   I don't know.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.120]   I don't want to leave.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.040]   I mean, it's sad when...
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.240]   You've got 21,000 followers now.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240]   Come on, you're doing fun.

[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   That's what people say.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.240]   They don't have a lot of those magic numbers.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.280]   I have good followers.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.440]   I do though.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440]   They post...
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440]   I love looking in people's pictures.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.280]   Come on.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.920]   It's the quality.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.720]   Not the quantity.

[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.600]   Oh, easy enough.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.720]   Do you use it for any or is it just personal?
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:49.240]   I use it just to kind of followers get like little tidbits on stuff I'm working on.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:56.240]   You might see a benchmark or two, or like we've been using it to show off like smartphone
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.200]   battery life and stuff like that as we finish the test.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.040]   And there you see the retweet.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.040]   See the retweet?
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   Yep.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:10.000]   So yeah, you just get kind of a little bit of inside info on what I'm working on, when
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.920]   I'm working on it, things I'm running into and stuff like that.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.680]   Well, let's get his follower count up to as long as we're at it.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.160]   Thank you, John, Anon, Steve, Lisa.

[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.960]   I want to do a little plug from-- I don't usually do much plugging, but we are going

[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.520]   But that's not the plug.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.400]   The plug is I'd like you to come see us.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:47.640]   We're doing a meetup Friday, July 30th at the Hyatt Dearborn in the Archimedes Lounge
