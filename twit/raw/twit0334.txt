[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.760]   Well, hello, and happy holidays to you, Leo LaPorte,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   your chief, Twit.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.800]   Yeah, you know what's coming.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   We don't have a new show for you this Sunday.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.160]   We're doing a best up.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.840]   Hey, it's the week after Christmas.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.360]   Nobody's in town.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.440]   And we thought there may be a few good things
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.120]   to happen in the year 2011 that we could look back at.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.520]   Remember, if you haven't seen it, it's new to you.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.720]   This is actually-- we'll kick off with a tribute.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.080]   Twit wouldn't exist if it weren't for all the great people
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240]   we bring on Twit.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.400]   That's one of the fun things about the show for me,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.440]   is getting some of the best tech journalists in all
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.000]   of the world to come on our show.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.120]   Here's a little montage, some highlights,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   of the variety of hosts we've had on Twit all year long.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.680]   Enjoy.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   And yes, we're back for a brand new year 2011.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.280]   And I thought, given a brand new year,
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.360]   I'd bring in the three oldest farts I know.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800]   In fact, I believe combined, we've
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.880]   got between the three of us, four of us.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.320]   We've got 250 years of experience,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.280]   starting in the lower right-hand corner.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.400]   I'll do this in reverse.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.280]   Larry just observed that you have the three longest running
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.400]   technology colonists in America who are still writing.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   On the air right now, starting with Larry Maggid,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.840]   who is at CBS News and his website LarryWiseWorld.com.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.120]   Barack Obama is joining us-- wait a minute.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.200]   I don't think--
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.880]   His lips don't move.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.800]   Where'd you get that, John?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   This is what-- this is part of the gift you sent me.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.360]   You sent me this Fez that says Twit on it.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.720]   And there's your MacBook Air.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   A second.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.440]   And then you sent me the wrong says.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.600]   Hey, Jerry.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   Hi.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.800]   Great to have you.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.480]   Windows is all right once you figure out how it works.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.720]   But it's just like going from Windows to Mac
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.040]   is always a little confusing.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.320]   And with Macs, everything is either very simple
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.800]   or it's utterly impossible.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280]   So you don't have to fight with it.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.240]   You don't figure out how to do it.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.960]   It just either just works or you give up.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.120]   Like that.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.320]   That's very apt.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.640]   It's time for Twit.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   Woo!
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   Oh my god, Champagne's all over the place.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   It is the sixth anniversary episode of this week in tech.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.880]   And you know what's so cool?
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.760]   We got all of the original characters together again.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.960]   We got the old band back together again here, Kevin.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   A little champagne.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.520]   Thank you, sir.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   Kevin Rose.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.480]   Let me pour you a glass.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.080]   Formerly CEO of Dig, host of Dig Nation, part owner of Revision--
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.680]   or if I guess full owner of Revision 3,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.040]   I don't know who owns Revision 3.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.520]   And--
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.240]   And--
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.040]   It was something else.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.120]   Oh, that milk thing.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   He's in a Belgian trans band.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.880]   That's right.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.680]   He's here.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   Milk, ink, Kevin Rose.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.200]   Great to have you back.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   In the studio.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.000]   Thanks for coming up.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.440]   I'm still here.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.960]   Six years.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   That's insane.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   Six years.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.440]   We're going into our seventh year.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.080]   And it is--
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.320]   I'm just really thrilled--
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.640]   We should take her to the 21st Amendment.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.120]   I know.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.520]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.760]   Now, I'm not counting that one.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   That was Twit Zero, which you were all at.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.040]   I don't know if-- Robert, were you there at the first one?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.480]   No, I think I was like the second one.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.400]   I still have those MP3s.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.280]   We still have to play it.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   I could play it if we want to hear them.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.720]   We still have them online.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   If you go to twit.tv/1--
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.200]   There was no video back then at all, right?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.760]   It was just to be great.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.200]   No, we didn't do video.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.840]   The first video was 20 episode 23 of things.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.480]   You were going to probably a $800 DAT player.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.280]   And you could probably buy something that does that now.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   It's crappier than that.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.560]   You probably do it this elephant.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.480]   You want to hear the first--
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.080]   This is a slate.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.600]   We call it Revenge of the Screenset.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.680]   The s***s.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'll say I have to bleep it because she forces, please don't.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.680]   Number one.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.360]   David Prager is also here in the studio with us.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.280]   Great to have you.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   Great to be back.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.200]   From revision three.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   Also here, Robert Heron Heron Fidelity.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.440]   And you were on the first one, weren't you?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.160]   Yeah, I think it was Robert Kevin, Patrick Norton.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.480]   And he's in absentia.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.720]   David wasn't on the first one.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.240]   But he was on the zero.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.040]   So, okay, I wasn't on zero.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.720]   I was on number one.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   Here's Robert.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Ah.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.520]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   And I was pulling you all up on Skype on one instance of Skype.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720]   And we had to back up with the DAT record.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.120]   Cheers.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.720]   Cheers.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.120]   Wow, what a--
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.760]   It's 10 more years.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.320]   10 is that all I get?
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.120]   We had a game.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.360]   All right, we had our seventh year of this week in tech.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.160]   John C. DeBorpe, people say, well, where's John?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.320]   John C. DeBorpe did not join the show till episode five.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.000]   You're right, Kevin.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.200]   Our first video episode was until 23.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.960]   We did that at the Apple Store.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.840]   And I'm all sweaty in it, because it was just me running
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   around and wiring the whole thing up.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.840]   And I just worked up a hell of a sweat.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.080]   I forgot it was video, I guess.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.760]   That was challenging.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.040]   And Roger Mcguin was with us over there.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.000]   You were there for that, right?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.720]   I remember doing it.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.840]   I remember doing it at Apple Store.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   It was one at the Apple Store, yeah.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.760]   And then we started doing it in a bar for a while.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.160]   Remember that?
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.960]   That didn't work out so well.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   Oh, it was up here.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.480]   That was kind of fun, though.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.360]   You bought all those Canon XL2?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.560]   That's what you got all around you.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.440]   I bought those because I wasn't doing video.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   So I bought these cameras, $14,000 worth of cameras,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040]   thinking we were going to do video,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.920]   and then we abandoned it because it was such a bad idea.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.440]   It was so hard to do it in bars and coffee shops.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.320]   Came back here, continued to do it for audio.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.600]   Just started a video about three years ago.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.880]   And now we're streaming 40 hours a week.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.400]   We had 55 million downloads in the last 12 months,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.760]   5 million a month now.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.320]   That is awesome.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.360]   And we're building a 10,000 square foot studio,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.680]   which we can barely afford.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.600]   But you need it.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   But you can see we're jammed in this room.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.280]   I can't do any more shows.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.800]   We'll be right back with a great panel.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.760]   We've got Brian Brushwood in studio.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.040]   Nilai Patel from this is my next.com.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.480]   Danny Sullivan from searchengineland.com.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   And my good friend, what's his name?
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.720]   And he'll be-- there he is, the Gmail blog.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.560]   No.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.640]   Tom, I screwed up here.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.600]   There we go.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.320]   I can give you a hand.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.040]   Yeah, Scott Johnson.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.360]   There we go.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.640]   No, goddamn it.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.320]   There he is.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   No.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.160]   There he is.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.440]   No, I give up.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.360]   We'll get you Scott later.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.800]   It's time for a twist.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.640]   Time to talk about the tech news of the week.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.200]   I am back.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.560]   And I want to thank Tom Merritt for doing such a great job
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.840]   for me while I was gone.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   Episode 290.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.800]   Now I missed a couple.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.280]   But boy, we have a great panel joining us right now,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.920]   starting with Cara Swisher, who actually came to the studio
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.240]   with her dog Finneas.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.680]   I did.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.240]   Hello.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.880]   Very nice from allthingsd.com.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   This is the brains of the operation.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.120]   Finneas is?
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.280]   He's actually about the most adorable dog I've ever seen.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.920]   I really--
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   He is.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.760]   I got my pound and I urge everybody to adopt dogs.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   A rescue dog.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   Rescue dog.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.880]   Oh, is he a sweetie?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.520]   We have a great panel starting with the throbbing Joshua
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.960]   Tupulski.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.480]   Easy.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.000]   Easy.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.080]   Easy after a chief.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   I like it.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.000]   Maybe if I don't say anything, we'll just go away.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.360]   Editor-in-chiefofinggadget.com, he seems to be
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.200]   silonning a little bit.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.080]   Just a little bit, just for you.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.280]   He's a little throbbing.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   Great to have you Joshua.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.320]   It was a big week for iPad 2.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.720]   We'll get his take on that.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.560]   That lady is Gina Smith, my old friend, who--
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.920]   she was on Twitter a few weeks ago.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.720]   She's a new editor-in-chief of Bite Magazine at bite.combyte.com.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.160]   Which is coming back, I'm happy to say.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   It's a sure thing.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   OK.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   This is the ugly side of the table.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.720]   Let's take a look at the attractive side of the table,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.320]   joining us right now from techcrunch.com.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.040]   Alexia Tzotz, it's great to have you.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.880]   Finally, up for all this time.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.800]   Very nice to meet you.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.680]   Welcome to the show.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.200]   Thank you.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.920]   I haven't met you.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.680]   Please to meet you.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.400]   How are you?
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   Thank you very much for being here.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.240]   Sitting to her left, Jolie Odell, formerly of Mashable.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.560]   Now at Venture Beat, congratulations on the new gig.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.240]   Thank you.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's great to have you both.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.960]   And you know what the deal is.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.560]   We talk about the week's tech news,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.600]   interspersed with profit-making commercials.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   I think a doctor is beautiful.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.240]   Exactly.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.480]   I don't think he's ugly.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   Oh, I'm going to have luck for a year.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.240]   I can't get a hairy ticket.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   And a rabbit's foot.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.040]   I'm good.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.720]   Hey, you shaved your head just for the shot of it.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.560]   I keep a smile for you, Uncle Leo.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.040]   Now Alexia drove up, and I understand that she was reading
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.760]   you the stories so you know what we were talking about today.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040]   Because I don't know how to read.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.360]   We have a great team here.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   Again, all in a studio with us, which I really like, it's fun.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.880]   And I kind of mockingly called this the couples Twitter,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.280]   because it is.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.440]   It's two couples.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.120]   You don't mind me calling you a couple, do you?
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.400]   It's not a secret.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.040]   Sarah Lane, the host of the social hour, iPad today, TNT,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.760]   my old friend from Tech TV.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.280]   Hi, Leo.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.680]   It's good to see you.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.960]   I'm very rarely here on a Sunday.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's kind of fun.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.760]   It's a little quieter.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.720]   And yet there's much larger studio audience.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.920]   Yeah, everybody.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.200]   Also joining us, her bow.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.760]   Can I call you a bow?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.320]   We've done promissoring, so yeah.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.120]   Have you really?
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.760]   Where's my promissoring?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.040]   No, he was talking about--
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.840]   MG and I have been promissoring.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.240]   MG Seeler, my bow is here.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.920]   Of course, the best writer on techcrunch.com.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.440]   Don't tell Mike I said that.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.800]   And Paris Lemon on Twitter.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.720]   Good to have you both.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.200]   Welcome.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.400]   Is this your first time on Twitter?
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.080]   No, you've been on Twitter.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.640]   I've been on Twitter before, but not in a while.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.840]   So that's it's Austin.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   It feels like the first thing.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.120]   That's what it was.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.840]   And then to my right, we have yet another couple,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.360]   the great Veronica Belmont from techzilla.com.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   It's been on Twitter many a time.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.480]   About.me/veronica.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.760]   Also the host of Sword and Leslie with Laser with Tom Merrin.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.120]   Yes.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.360]   Which is a wonderful show about sci-fi and fantasy books.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.880]   Yeah, we actually just saw George R.R. Martin down
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.360]   at the Fox Theater in Redwood City.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.480]   Did you get his autograph?
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.520]   Tom-- well, yeah, he was doing a book signing.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   The author of Game of Thrones, Flash of Kings.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.400]   I'm just starting class of Kings, so I'll be ready for the next season.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.840]   Nice.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   Good.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.440]   I love those books.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:22.800]   They're great.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.440]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.480]   Sitting next to her, her longtime companion.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.760]   Right.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.480]   Couples twin.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.720]   Most awkward twin ever.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.080]   I feel like Bob, you've been--
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.280]   I think we need to know it.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.640]   This is not the couple's-- not couple's twin.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.800]   This is "Beards versus Banks."
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.080]   Beards versus Banks.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   That is.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.840]   Look at that.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.880]   Wow, that's absolutely true.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.200]   You're on.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.600]   And I am just thrilled.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.240]   We've been able to get people in studio for almost every show
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.120]   since we moved to the Brick House studio.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920]   But there's one guy, but I always wanted that.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.800]   One guy I could not get.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.160]   For the longest time, Mr. Merlin Mann is in here in studio
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.660]   this.
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.160]   Hi, Leah.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.080]   Mr. 43folders.com, Merlin Mann.com.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.240]   And his great show on the 5x5 network with Dan Benjamin
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   back to work, productivity, communication, work barriers,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   constraints, tools, and more.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.200]   Is there anything you left out?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   Anime.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.800]   There's no anime in that show.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   We have a whole manga.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.160]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.920]   Now, we have a manga corner.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   Manga corner.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.000]   5x5.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.960]   Thank you for having me, Stevie.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.280]   For those of you who haven't been here,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.400]   it's extraordinary in here.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.920]   It's a lot like the Captain Nemo ride.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.680]   It is.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.480]   It's a thrill ride.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.440]   Well, we're really glad to have you back, Merlin Mann.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.600]   Very nice to see you.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.960]   Haven't seen you in ages.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.440]   Also, here, really glad to have him up here for the first time,
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.040]   Mr. Harry McCracken from the technology--
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.800]   technologyizer blog.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.000]   Great to see you, Harry.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.160]   It's nice to be here in person.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.840]   We've ever had you in person.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.000]   I mean, if I knew you were so close to Copperfield,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.680]   I would have come down--
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.440]   You like the bookstore?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.120]   I love that place.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.360]   We have a great independent bookstore.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.160]   Still, one of the last places in the world,
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.480]   I think, with an independent bookstore.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.840]   And also, unfortunately, we haven't got Dwight to come up
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.520]   from Houston, maybe some day soon.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.360]   Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle,
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.800]   blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.000]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.240]   Hey, Leo, how are you doing?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   Very hot here.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.880]   It's really hot here.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.840]   It's muggy.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.400]   I bet you don't--
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   No, it's not too muggy, but I'll tell you something.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.320]   I'm going to show you something that's kind of amazing.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.400]   Whoa, no, no.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.160]   That's not real.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.400]   Yep, that is real.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.560]   That's now.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.080]   Those look--
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.280]   That number looks as fake as the TMZ picture of Steve Jobs.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.840]   I don't buy it.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.800]   I don't buy it.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400]   I think you're going to be photoshopping it.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.680]   It's the second day in a row.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.680]   It's got a hundred and a half.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.160]   I'm here.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.840]   Harrible.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.920]   It's diver to it.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.960]   We are at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.520]   And when I say we, I mean we.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.680]   Boy, I think this is the biggest panel we've ever had.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.640]   And it's not full yet.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.200]   There are more people still to come.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.000]   Let me introduce everybody.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.120]   I'll start from my right here with the great Robert Herron.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.960]   Hey, hello there.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.800]   It's good to see you again.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.600]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.000]   Robert's an original Twitter.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.500]   Oh.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.240]   It's good to be here.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.960]   From the very beginning.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.880]   I'll see you yesterday.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.360]   It's great.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.680]   You do home theater, so we'll talk a lot about big screens
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.440]   in just a little bit.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.880]   Awesome.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.720]   His company is Herron Fidelity.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.280]   It is.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.680]   And you still do a HD nation on as part of Texility's days.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.680]   Exactly.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.040]   Also, if we slide the mic to the right,
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.680]   because we have to share Mike's, Becky Worley from ABC News
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.960]   is here and TNT, of course.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.480]   Hi, Becky.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.640]   It's great to be here with you.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.480]   My old friend.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.080]   You did this best CES ever.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.320]   It's my best CES ever.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:23.840]   No joke.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.760]   I don't believe it will find out.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.840]   I'm not just being perky.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.640]   I'm just having a great time.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.600]   She turned down the hair.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.360]   I read her Facebook.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.320]   She said, I realized I was being defensive and doing
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.280]   the helmet hair thing.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.840]   Don't use hairspray as a crutch.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.920]   That's not a good idea.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.280]   She almost poked my eye out.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.520]   That's what Schuud's here for.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.560]   We'll see that in a moment.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.080]   First, let's go to table two.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.960]   And Tom Merritt.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.560]   Good to have you.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.080]   No, they owe.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.960]   TNT.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.080]   He's been doing a great job here.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.680]   TNT and everything else covering the show floor.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.320]   I live at CES now.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.880]   It feels like it doesn't have my life before this.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.800]   Me neither.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.120]   That's actually a true feeling.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.720]   And there really is.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.840]   Have we always been here?
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:57.960]   It's like--
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.000]   It's only the third day.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.720]   You understand?
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.120]   No, that's not too clear.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.840]   Actually, your fourth day, my third.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.640]   Sarah Lane is here.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.480]   Thank you for being here.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.120]   Sarah Lane, also from TNT and iPad today.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.560]   She doesn't need your mic.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.000]   She has her very own.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.640]   Thanks, though.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.520]   She also has the largest laptop.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   I do.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.800]   It's a 17-inch laptop, the largest laptop in the land.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.840]   That's only because the guy to your left
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.480]   didn't bring his Brian Brushwood.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.280]   Rocket the iPad.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.760]   Hey, it's my first CES ever.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.240]   Is this?
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.000]   Oh, we're going to get a CES.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.520]   We're going to see how it feels to have your cherry
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.840]   popped in Vegas.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.320]   Oh, thank you.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.440]   And just a little bit.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.320]   That's actually good.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.560]   Now, we need to have one person who's never
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.000]   been here before to kind of give us some perspective.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.720]   All right.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   I Justine is also here.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.600]   Justine is Eric.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.360]   I don't think it's here.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.920]   I justine.com.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.800]   You don't need a computer.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.920]   I got my mini iPad.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   You're set.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.480]   The mini iPad, that's all you need.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.120]   It's great to have you here, Justine.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.920]   You were working for Spike for a little bit.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.160]   Yeah, that's neat.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.520]   That's fantastic.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.160]   I saw you sitting in a very cool--
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.360]   was it Trans Am or something?
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.160]   It was a needle scar.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   I don't know.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   I'm not either.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.000]   But it was nice.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.440]   It was nice.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440]   Well, hello, Austin!
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.380]   You.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.320]   We are at Momo U.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.240]   It's cute.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   And we are hot up at you.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.720]   Nice.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   You.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.080]   A whole bunch of twin heads with us today.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.960]   And you are great.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.160]   You guys are great.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   We are at South by Southwest, which, of course,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.840]   is where the geeks gather every year.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.760]   Nerd Fest 2011, South by Southwest Interactive.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.560]   We have such a great bunch of people on Twitch.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.000]   We have probably 20 people on Twitch.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.280]   So we're going to move through it pretty quickly
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.080]   and maybe get some more people in here and everything.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.800]   But let me introduce the beginnings.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.920]   What a great panel to start it off, starting on all the way
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.800]   on stage right with Ryan Block from GadgetGGT.com.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.280]   Woo!
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.360]   Sitting next to him is partner Peter Rojas, also from Gadget.com.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.360]   Jeff Travis from this week and Google the author
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   of what would Google do in the Edge?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   Jeff Teweid.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   Next to him, Gina Trapani, a formerly life hacker.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.560]   Everybody's favorite geek.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.880]   She's got the geek watch too.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.400]   She's got that very cool watch with the nanol out there.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.040]   Look at that.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.800]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.600]   These are my fine site, Lorneo.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.000]   Lorneo.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.560]   They were handing out onion papers.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   There's actually a physical paper.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.640]   We have a special South by Southwest edition of America's
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.240]   finest newspaper content rolling out this week on the web.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.800]   It's amazing.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.360]   It's incredible.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.160]   We're covering it.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.000]   Pseudolive.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Pseudolive.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.480]   Pseudolive.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.040]   I love the onion.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.520]   It's awesome.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.280]   It's always good to have you on baritone.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.360]   Also sitting right next to him at Callie Lewis,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.640]   Callie Lewis from Geekbeat.tv.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.360]   And my crowd surfing partner here, Lisa Bettany.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.280]   [CHEERING]
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.440]   There's one person there would not be tweet without.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.560]   It's this guy.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.120]   John C. Devorak.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.760]   Here are his greatest hits.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   Well, that's a look at the week ahead.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.800]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   Catch Tom Merritt.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.760]   Every single day we cover detectives.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.800]   And then, Cleo, here's a look at some of the welcome, Tom.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.200]   Can I ask-- can I ask Tom a question?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.320]   Yeah, would you go ahead.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.720]   Tom, don't go yet.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   I think John asked.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.040]   Hey, Tom, I wanted to ask you a question
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.320]   about that phone.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.160]   That rim thing.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.920]   You know the rim thing.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.480]   I mean, I mean--
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.560]   What about that camera thing going on?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   Yeah, what the hell is--
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   Where's the camera thing?
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.440]   You know what was the web--
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.760]   Shakes off Blizzcon down an hour.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.280]   He's a little more limited than Siri.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.360]   I just got to tell you right now.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.760]   All that more is what will be keeping an eye on you.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   Oh, thank you, Tom.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.360]   Tom, Tom, before you go, I wonder,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.880]   where's that the Science Festival in--
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.480]   where is that?
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:37.920]   Where is that?
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.000]   No, where is it?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.520]   Tom?
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:39.840]   Hello.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   That's an interesting question, John.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.880]   I'm going to have to get back to you
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.760]   because I have to go cover this thing right now.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.440]   But hold that thought.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.760]   And next time you're on Tech News today, we'll talk about it.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   Good work.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.200]   I was wondering how long it would take.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.600]   Just keep trying.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.440]   Tom Merritt and Tech News today with IAS Actar and Sarah Lane
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   on every Monday through Friday, 2.30 in the afternoon.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.680]   You get your daily fix of Tech News
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.480]   with people who actually know what they're talking about
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.440]   on the Twit network.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.640]   What are you doing?
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.800]   What are you doing, John?
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.640]   I'm watching you.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.720]   You're being disruptive.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.800]   I am, yes, I'm sorry.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.880]   Give me that chewing gum.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.200]   Give me that same go, you just started acting like a show.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.280]   I'm going to send you the--
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.360]   Anyway, thank you for being here, Brian, Richard.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.120]   Tom Merritt, the host of TNT, our daily-- actually,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.720]   how are you going to do this?
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.880]   What?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.520]   The week ahead.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.560]   Oh, I'll just go over there and do that.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   Will you just go over there and do it?
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.600]   Normally, I'm just over there.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   So I'll just-- OK.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   OK.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.280]   Do we do that now?
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.760]   Really?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.800]   We'll see.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.280]   Let's see.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.720]   Let's check in right now.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.640]   Tom Merritt, who hosts TNT.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.800]   It does the--
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.360]   I'll give him a couple of minutes to get over there.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.480]   He does our great daily news show, 2.30 PM Pacific, 5.30
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.280]   Eastern Monday through Friday.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.920]   Tom, what's coming up on the week ahead?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.840]   Here's a look at what will be covered on Texas today.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   Hey, this is Bogas.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   This is Bogas.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.960]   It's the last day of Science Hack Day in San Francisco.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.840]   Also, Mario 3D Land launches.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.160]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.040]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.080]   Thank you, Tom.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:09.720]   That's great.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   Right over there.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.320]   Ran over there, did that.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.520]   One take Merritt, people on--
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.440]   Beautiful.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.960]   Beautiful.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   Well done.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.200]   That was amazing.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.000]   Well, Eileen was inserting those on the fly.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   That's amazing.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.280]   We have the best production team in the world.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.040]   Did you notice that you have a different t-shirt on now?
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.160]   Did you change it on the way back?
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   No, he doesn't.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.040]   No, try that.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.560]   We know.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.440]   Why would you change that?
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   It's called magic.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   You have that purple thing on just a minute ago.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.840]   What'd you do to put it back on?
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   It slides into the--
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.680]   It leaves.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.720]   He probably just did the deal.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Keep trying, John.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.920]   He got the Grinch of the way to--
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.840]   With Cotton, he was perfect.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.920]   I'm not going to be beaten at this game.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.840]   You know, I think for one thing, E-Lop is very much--
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.560]   he's got the same cadence and style of Bill Gates when he speaks.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   And there's a certain cadence that comes out of Microsoft.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.800]   That is-- you know, it's just Microsofty.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.240]   And I've run into a bunch of these guys,
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.920]   and they come out of Microsoft as executives,
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.840]   and they go to other companies, and they do the same thing.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.400]   They have all these ideas, and they think
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.280]   that they're going to be successful with them.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.120]   But I'm always thinking they never
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.520]   seem to get it that when they were at Microsoft,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.440]   they were part of an anopoly company that really didn't
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.960]   have to do a lot of original thinking.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.920]   And they didn't have to make the right decision.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.640]   The right decision at Microsoft was let's don't kill office.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.080]   And let's don't kill windows.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   And that's the only decision you have to make.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.440]   Anything else you do is just as gravy.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.440]   And--
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.840]   Good, do you think this is not a good idea?
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.280]   Yeah, I think it's not a good idea.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   I think they should have at least--
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.480]   although nobody asked the question,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   I was very disappointed in the media,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.680]   because they didn't ask the question of ELOP
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.120]   whether or not they kept the option for Android Open.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.760]   He did mention that they were keeping--
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.080]   It doesn't sound that way.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.200]   Doesn't sound that way, but he did keep the MIGO option open.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.680]   So it's a possibility.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.600]   Yeah, what they did is they said,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.280]   we're going to partner up with Microsoft.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   They're going to give us Windows Phone 7.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   We're going to give them Navtech mapping.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.040]   And it's going to be a tight partnership.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.960]   We'll be able to actually change the interface,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.840]   which nobody else has been able to do.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.560]   Symbian becomes what they call a franchise platform,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.720]   which I guess is Finnish for we're phasing it out.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.640]   And then MIGO becomes a research and development platform.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.600]   They're going to put out one MIGO device this year.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.880]   And he keeps saying, he kept saying today in his announcement,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.240]   and it's going to be the disruptive platform of the future.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:28.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.440]   Saving it for disruptive stuff.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.720]   I don't know what that means at all.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.560]   Well, the other thing, anyway, there's
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.920]   a couple things going on in Finland.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.960]   There's a walk out at a couple of the factories.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.160]   The employees are irked about this guy and the whole process.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.920]   And there's a term going around Finland called Goof, G-O-O-F.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.080]   And it refers to get out of Finland,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.240]   because everybody believes that Microsoft is either going
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.640]   to do a deal and either buy most of Nokia and outsource it
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.120]   to China and pretty much closed down,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.880]   killing 150,000 jobs in Finland.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.280]   This is what they believe at in Finland.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.440]   And so this is problematic, because if you bend to Finland
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.320]   or if you study how the Finns think,
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.760]   it's not very compatible with Microsoft the way they think
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.280]   in Redmond, Washington.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's just culturally different.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.880]   I think this guy should have taken a little more cultural
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.520]   anthropology.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.080]   I think there's a lot of issues here.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.400]   It's going to be fun to watch what happens.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.560]   I mean, I hope they're successful, but I doubt if they will be.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   And I also think they're going to--
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.880]   I'm just so surprised, because I think if Nokia doesn't evolve
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.440]   in this way, there's no way they're going to stay alive.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.880]   I mean, Microsoft excels at getting their software out
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.120]   on devices, whether it's Windows or Windows Phone 7
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   or whatever platform they're trying
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.400]   to spread across the world.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.720]   That's what they do best.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.560]   And Nokia has been making hardware forever,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.600]   and they make more hardware for phones
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.960]   than I think anyone else in the world at this point.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.600]   So the idea of getting Windows Phone 7 on Nokia devices
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.520]   across the world, I think it makes perfect sense
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.320]   for both brands.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.000]   It may not be good for the people in Finland, but brands.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.120]   Well, here's a couple of questions then.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.480]   One, why can't they do the same thing with Android, which
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.000]   has apps, and we're in the world of apps,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.280]   and Microsoft has none.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.720]   They have 8,000, I think.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.280]   They're growing apps, though, and they're
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.920]   going to absorb all the apps from the open
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   into their store also.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.400]   It's weak.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.840]   Anyway, your argument, how would that not apply exactly
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.680]   the same way to Android?
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.360]   Here's what the problem is, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.560]   is that the Windows 7 phone, straight up,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.840]   when straight competition with Android and the iPhone,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.760]   shows no traction.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.280]   Now--
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.840]   I disagree.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.080]   Well, I mean, I'm just reading the monthly numbers.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.040]   Apparently, they sold a whole bunch of phones right off
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.160]   the bat, and then the thing went dead flat
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   after they filled the channel up.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.360]   They haven't released any numbers.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   They haven't released any numbers.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   There are some research companies that have said,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.920]   I have to dig this up now, apparently,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.000]   to back up my own story.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.480]   When Microsoft has a hit, they release numbers,
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.960]   and they trumpet them.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.440]   And they have not released any numbers here.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.840]   And I think that they are not selling these at all.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.600]   When you use one of these phones,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.080]   when you use a Windows phone, it's a great phone to use it.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.200]   But the problem is, is that no one's
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.840]   going to try it in the era of Android
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   and in the era of the iPhone.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.720]   I don't know necessarily that the race is over.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.480]   But you've got two people who basically,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.640]   two companies that, in terms of mobile,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.040]   have become clueless, and they're drowning,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.240]   and they're trying to cling to each other in order to survive.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.080]   And there's no indication that they'll do better together
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.520]   than they would have separately.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.680]   They won't be any faster.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.360]   They won't be any more agile.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.480]   And they're not going to have the same kind of mind
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.120]   share that Android and Apple do at the moment.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.080]   I kind of disagree on that, because I think, like I said earlier,
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.720]   Nokia makes really good hardware,
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.080]   and they've got the reach worldwide.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.560]   And Windows makes good mobile software, I think so anyway.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.720]   And so I think the combination is actually a really good fit.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   And I think it makes the most sense for both of them
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.200]   to kind of go into a partnership together.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.560]   And their power is combined.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.920]   They're kept in cell phone.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.680]   I don't know.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.160]   But no kids do a great job of making smartphones these days
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   that people really fell in love with.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.680]   And maybe with the combination of Windows Phone 7,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.640]   it will be something that they can do going forward.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.480]   Because I mean, feature phones are the way of the past.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.200]   It's smartphones and even lower price smartphones going forward.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.240]   And Windows, Microsoft can make that happen for them.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.080]   Well, like the Indians like to say,
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.280]   two turkeys don't make an eagle.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.760]   So TV app in your lap.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   That's by the way, the ones--
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.080]   TV app in your lap.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.120]   That's there in your lap.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.040]   App in your lap, get it.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   App in your lap.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   App in your lap.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   Come, hurry up.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.640]   Because you're probably the one guy who could be.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.280]   What is that around here?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.320]   This is-- it's so far no problem.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.360]   However, I do fear when I see these bandwidth caps put on.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.920]   There are-- I'll tell you, I've been
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.480]   hurt outside the US in countries like Canada and Australia,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   where they have much lower bandwidth caps.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.520]   Many of our viewers in Australia can't watch the video
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.880]   because it would use up their bandwidth cap.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.160]   And I fear that that time is rapidly coming to the United
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.320]   States.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.600]   And it's-- and it's by the way, it's
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.640]   not an interest to protecting their constrained resources.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.600]   Because-- and John and I, you've had this fight many times
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.720]   with me over the cost of bits.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.600]   I don't think it's that.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.440]   I think it's to protect their entrenched businesses.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.040]   They're cable, premium cable channels.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.880]   Well, that could be, Leo.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.760]   But let's take another look at this.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.160]   What has the government done about all these antitrust deals?
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   Every time an opportunity comes for them
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.920]   to say no to something like this AT&T up-cutting buyout.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.760]   They don't say no.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.800]   They just-- they encourage it.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.840]   So what is the government going to do if you put the FCC
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.440]   in charge?
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.920]   They're going to encourage more of this.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.880]   And then who's going to get--
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.400]   the thing is there-- I don't see that they're doing,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.480]   but anybody any good.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   Now, the net neutrality is already hearing.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.600]   And it's all boiling down to the point
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.440]   where you're going to have to buy a license to do the show
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.280]   you're doing right now.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.200]   That's the only way it's where it's headed.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.760]   They haven't done anything any good for anybody.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.960]   They're not stopping this AT&T merger, which
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.800]   is a disaster with T-Mobile.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.640]   I don't want that.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.120]   Nobody does.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.720]   They're going to get more milk.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   But I think having this kind of telemetry built into everything
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:21.440]   and--
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.680]   It's all free.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.880]   They're going to hook everything up to Powerline IP.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.680]   All the appliances in your house are going to be--
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.400]   Well, they're doing it now.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   I've got a smart meter on my--
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.560]   It's going to be worse.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.320]   And then eventually the refrigerator
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.920]   is going to have an LCD screen on.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.040]   It's going to be hooked to the internet.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.400]   And all you're going to get every time you go to the refrigerator
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.160]   is an ad.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.120]   Yeah, Safeway.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.280]   Here, buy some more of this.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.000]   Buy some more of that.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.680]   There's a coupon.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.360]   Hit this button.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.040]   It'll print it out on your computer.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.520]   I mean, who needs this aggravation?
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   We got enough ads already.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.320]   It's driving everybody crazy.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.400]   It's ruining the world.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.600]   Philip K. Dick wrote a great, short story about that,
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.280]   where ads on every possible surface of--
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.640]   I still think is a good thing to put them in the urinals.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.840]   Having an ad there.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.160]   You know we have in our urinal.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.240]   We have a little bumblebee.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   Hey, by the way, you're urinal.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.440]   It's broken.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.320]   You have a high-tech urinal.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.840]   It's broken.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.520]   And I get it.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:09.680]   It's broken.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.120]   You got a bunch of high-tech toilets here.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.520]   By the way, never if you go to this toy,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.560]   don't ever push the button that says RT.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.440]   It doesn't stand for retweet.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.080]   Anyone who knows jokes will get that.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.240]   Obviously, Scoble knew what you were talking about.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.040]   Let's talk about retweeting.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.000]   One last--
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.200]   Everybody's back in their seats.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.040]   The only guy who does--
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.240]   Whoa!
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.480]   He just shot those--
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.280]   That was a twood.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.760]   That was very shush-wood.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.480]   To see a slowly-walking JCD looking
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   and then just whip out a gun right at your face.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.920]   He frags you, man.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.800]   I sold a drink.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.680]   He should be on the game.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.920]   There was some part of me that thought this is how it ends.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.520]   Unsastinated by John C. de Vorac on Twitch.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.920]   That was possible.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.360]   We're going to--
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.720]   Lueb is Louis Klimmer's entrepreneurial show
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.440]   that goes on in Paris December 6/7.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:00.920]   The nape--
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.080]   John, get--
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.560]   No, no, it's not a joke.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.840]   Oh, we have to pay our own way.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.240]   And we are--
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.360]   We're-- Twits going to be in Paris.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   We're going to have a booth there.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.000]   We're going to interview people.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.400]   We're actually going to broadcast from Lueb
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.960]   for those three days.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.320]   Junk it.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.840]   All--
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.760]   What company is--
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.880]   I don't understand whose--
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.840]   Did you not invite John?
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.480]   Oh, that's it.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.000]   He's grumpy.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   He's not.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.120]   How could it be a junkie if there's
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.400]   no company that we're sponsoring it?
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.920]   I don't understand what the junket part is.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   He's a junket.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.000]   It's a junket?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.720]   Well, if it's a junket, I like it.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   And--
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.560]   I want to thank you for scoble.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.880]   Are you going to go on?
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.440]   I am.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.960]   Awesome.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.440]   Excellent.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.360]   Well, I hope you and scoble will come by the IBM booth.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   Junk it.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.840]   It's great coverage.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.640]   That's going to be a lot of--
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.440]   I think that's a show, Tails.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   Junk it.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.920]   Junk it.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.280]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.200]   And then, yes, we will be at CES for another junket.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.560]   Junk it.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.880]   A junket which costs us about $50,000.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.000]   Is that OK?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.400]   It's OK.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.600]   Can a junket cost you money?
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.680]   Apparently, it does with you.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.600]   You're not doing it right.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.920]   I'm not doing it right.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   [BELL RINGING]
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.200]   And--
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.360]   Steak's done.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:12.800]   I don't know.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.760]   What do you use that timer?
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.560]   Is that just to say hi?
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.080]   Oh, look.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.520]   He's got a little--
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.520]   No, he's got a little--
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.320]   I've decided that everyone should have one of these tap
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   bells.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   I agree.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.160]   [BELL RINGING]
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.000]   For their desk at work.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.640]   Nice.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.160]   And--
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.720]   So somebody-- you're busy, you're hunched over the computer.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.160]   You got this thing on your desk, and somebody
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.560]   wants to talk to you?
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.080]   [BELL RINGING]
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.280]   That's a good idea.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.120]   My kids would like me to have one at the dinner table,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.400]   because I'm always in my nose buried in a device.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.120]   They could ding my bell.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   [BELL RINGING]
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   Ding dats bell.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   [BELL RINGING]
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   Ding dats bell.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   Ding dats bell.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.120]   Ding dats bell.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   Ding dats bell.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.520]   With apologies to Anita--
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520]   What is her name, Anita?
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.040]   Baker.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   Baker.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   Anita.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.560]   Anita.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.800]   Anita Hot Pocket.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.920]   Let's-- I have to ask you both.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   I know I think John is a Windows user.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.160]   Are you a Windows user?
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.000]   Becky, where are you?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.320]   No, I'm predominantly a Mac user,
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.920]   but we have Windows machines at home.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.880]   I try and stay fluent on both.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.400]   Me too.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.920]   I think it's important in our jobs.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   John, you-- you-- mostly Windows, right?
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.480]   So here I--
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   Yeah, mostly Windows.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.560]   Did you look with interest?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.320]   If you go to microsoft.com/presspass,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.600]   there's a lot of video of Steven Sonofsky
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   at the D8 conference, and then of somebody
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.800]   at the Computex Conference in Taiwan
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.960]   demonstrating the new user interface.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.360]   It's-- well, it looks like Windows Phone.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   It's so weird.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.040]   I don't like it.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.600]   I think I wrote a column about it.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.240]   I think it's in PC Magazine.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.120]   I think it's a disaster if they implement it.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.040]   Well, I'm sure they are.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   Clearly-- Are we on cycle for disaster?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.480]   What does it go?
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.160]   98, disaster?
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.960]   Emmy.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.480]   Emmy.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:39.980]   Emmy.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.840]   Emmy was disaster.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.400]   Windows XP good.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   Windows Vista disaster.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.080]   Bad.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.160]   Windows 7 good.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.400]   So this would be the-- This is disaster.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.000]   Disaster time.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   That's what I'm--
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.120]   So we're right on track.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.920]   It's like the Star Trek movies.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.520]   So I'm saying.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.280]   Why don't you like it, John?
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.400]   Well, I think for one thing, I don't think that the model--
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.880]   I think it's a done deal what a desktop computer should be
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.840]   like, how it should be used.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.160]   Those-- that interface that we're talking about,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.800]   that they're trying to replace it with,
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.440]   is for small screens, it's-- the reason it's designed--
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.480]   there's a reason it was designed the way it was designed.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.920]   The reason that Steve Jobs brought it into play,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.160]   because it was the thing you could use with your finger
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   and a touchscreen and a small touchscreen.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.920]   And you needed to--
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.680]   You know, you need these icons to move around.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.120]   Have big icons.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.600]   There's a rationale for it.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.360]   There's no rationale for this stupid interface
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.200]   to be on a large 21-inch, 27-inch screen.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.440]   It's crazy.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.840]   So we're talking about, just for people who haven't seen it
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.400]   or are listening, we're talking about the Metro UI that's
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.600]   on the Windows Phone 7.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.440]   It has the large tiles that each represent sort of a concept,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.640]   or, you know, like social, or contacts, or phone,
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.280]   or-- but this would have--
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.840]   specific-- it's almost like-- they're
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.040]   trying to create almost like an expose interface,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.520]   but for Windows and using it, marrying it with the Metro UI
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.480]   that we've gotten to know on the phone.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.800]   It's a touch interface.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.280]   Exactly.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.800]   Now, here's what my theory is.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.840]   My theory is that Microsoft has had nothing but difficulty
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.880]   adapting its operating system to the phone.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.120]   And what they've always tried to do since the very beginning
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.840]   with Windows-- before Windows Phone
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.400]   when they had their first smartphones
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.240]   is they took the big Windows interface from a desktop
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.680]   and put it on the phone.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.080]   So now, instead of separating these two
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.840]   with separate items and separate things,
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.400]   they keep wanting to have them all the same,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.360]   because I think they figure that all their users
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.920]   are complete idiots, and they can't go from one model
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.800]   to another.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.920]   So they're going to take the phone model that they know
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.880]   works on small screens and move it to the desktop.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.600]   Now, I think they can save themselves by having a little butt
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.720]   you can push that would throw you back to the real.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.280]   They do.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.840]   That's what's so strange about this,
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.360]   is it really is just a shell--
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.080]   It's a skin.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.920]   --on top of what looks like when it's a--
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.440]   Look at it.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:51.940]   Look at it.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.800]   Picture of it up on this video.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.080]   It looks dumb.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.920]   This is the default that will show up on all computers that
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.080]   ship with this, and you have to revert back to the--
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.720]   It looks like a kiosk.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.080]   Kind of thing you find out, a kiosk getting Macy's.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.320]   Well, all right.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.160]   See, and there's the start menu.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.920]   So he slides it over on the right,
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.680]   and you can just jump underneath it.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.160]   And so when you have Microsoft Excel or Office or whatever,
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.480]   and you need to have that kind of--
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   let's face it, get real Windows control, you can get there.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.880]   But let me play devil's advocate here.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   One of the things that the iPad really proved to everybody
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.480]   is that there is a market for a simpler computing experience.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.720]   The iPad requires a touchscreen interface
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.280]   that requires your finger or thumb or something like that
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.560]   to move things around.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.920]   This is not what desktop computing is about.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.520]   This even has a pop-up keyboard, which is idiotic.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.960]   I have a real keyboard.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.800]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.560]   Why do I need this pool crap?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.000]   Well, I guess this is one UI for all devices.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.960]   So if you've got a tablet--
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.880]   That's the problem.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.840]   They have their heads up their butts with this one UI
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.760]   for everything they do notion.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.080]   They're crazy.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   I kind of feel bad for Microsoft.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.720]   God, Devorak, I miss you, man.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.520]   That kind of-- I mean, there's so many bad things
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.120]   going on in the world, but this pisses you off so much.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.720]   It's so comforting to me.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.280]   I'm not about other stuff, too.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.080]   This is-- I'm still trying to play devil's advocate here.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.880]   I think it's a great tablet UI.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   It's a tablet UI.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.480]   Really good tablet UI, but why try and put this on?
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.240]   How do the HP touch smart sell?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.320]   Because that's a touch desktop with--
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.760]   using Windows Vista or Windows 7.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.160]   Look at this.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.960]   They're very proud of this.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.080]   It's got a split keyboard you could type with your thumb.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.160]   I don't think that they've been set in the world on fire,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.040]   and I still go back--
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   So now, see, you've got Excel.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.400]   So you have a normal experience,
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.440]   a Windows experience underneath,
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.600]   but you can slide it to get tweet a drama.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.960]   You know, there's this core.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.360]   This is great for that ubiquitous kitchen computer
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.200]   that every PC maker wants to sell.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.360]   And that's the touch smart.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.280]   Wait, the touch smart.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.000]   So that you can touch, you can treat it like a tablet,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.560]   but then you can move into a multitasking.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.440]   You have more detailed input output with a keyboard
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.520]   and a mouse, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.800]   What if we're just old farts who just want things to stay the same?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.480]   No, that's not it, Leo.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   The desktop metaphor, which was developed in 1980 something,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.520]   1984, I guess, mainly, or '82, or actually
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.680]   when the Xerox Star came out, established.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.280]   And then it was tweaked and tweaked and tweaked.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.600]   This is like the automobile.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.160]   You can drive a 1935 car, because it's been--
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.440]   the model, how it works, where the gears can start
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.640]   with the pedals.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.160]   It's finally established itself as this is the way
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.360]   it should be.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.720]   Why would you change it so radically out of the blue?
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.400]   This is like people dreaming up some crazy car
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.160]   where the wheels in the middle.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.760]   And you got the pair of scopes.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.600]   It's that tomorrow on Monday, Apple
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.840]   will be talking about Lian, OS X line.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.320]   It's new operating system.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.080]   And they're not even going this far.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.680]   I mean, they have a full screen mode.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.320]   Because they're not stupid at Apple.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.800]   No.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.440]   Oh, oh, John really regrets that window, Zirin.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.960]   In fact, I'm sure he's mad about us running it
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.640]   again.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.800]   But hey, he was on fire.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   He was on Fuego.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:17.960]   And you know what?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.680]   Time will only tell.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.320]   But I have a feeling he might not be far wrong.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.000]   John C. de Vorek has been a big reason why
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.200]   Twitch has been so successful over the years.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.280]   Twitch's in its what?
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   Sixth year.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.520]   This will be year seven coming up.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.200]   And we decided in 2011 to get more John on the show.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.720]   And I think you'll agree.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.800]   A tweet without John C. de Vorek is
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.400]   like a fish without a bicycle.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.120]   We're going to take a break.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   Come back with more.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.160]   But first, a word from audible.com.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.840]   Our sponsor, since almost the very beginning on Twitch.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.680]   And for good reason, I've been an Audible subscriber since 2000.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.800]   It'll be 12 years this January.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   12 years of listening to great books on Audible.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.920]   You know, when I first started listening to Audible books,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.640]   they only had a few thousand titles.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.080]   Now, over 100,000 and more new titles all the time.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.760]   In fact, it's pretty much become the case
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.240]   that when a big new book comes out,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.680]   the same day the hard cover comes out in the bookstores,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.840]   the audio book comes out on Audible.com.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.320]   It's why most of the time now, I'm listening to the new books.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.360]   And there's good reason.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.440]   I don't have time to read.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   I'm sure you don't either.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.240]   But we always have time when we're stuck in the car,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.000]   working out at the gym, doing housework, working in the garden.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.800]   There are plenty of times when you can't hold a book.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.600]   But you would like to read a book.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.800]   And I probably wouldn't get much reading done all week
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.120]   long if it weren't for Audible.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.320]   And yet, there are hours and hours each day
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.200]   that I cannot read, but I can listen to Audible.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.360]   That's why I recommend Audible.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.840]   And I encourage you to give it a try.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.800]   We've got a special deal for a Twit listeners.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.040]   Two books free.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.400]   Go to Audible.com, browse their 100,000 title collection.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.480]   I'm sure you'll find some books you want to listen to.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.280]   Really, the problem is that you only get two.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.520]   Probably you'll find hundreds of books you want to listen to.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.360]   This was a good one.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.480]   I listened to this this year.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.440]   This was a perfect example.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.320]   I got it in the hard cover.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.400]   I got it on the Kindle.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.280]   And I got it on Audible.com.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.680]   And absolutely, the only way I could get through this 600 page
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.360]   book is because I was able to listen to it on Audible.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.160]   I read it in a whole-- and one week.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.640]   One week.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.880]   I know many of you are probably still
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.720]   trying to slog through it.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.800]   If you haven't read the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson,
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.920]   yet, very good choice on Audible.com.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.240]   Another great one is that new Stephen King novel,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.040]   November 22nd, 1963.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.840]   Just started that unbelievably good.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.960]   But that's just two.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.720]   Here's the deal.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.680]   Go to Audible.com/twit2 and sign up for the platinum account.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   That's going to give you credit for two books.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.960]   You don't actually actually have to pick the books right away.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.000]   You can now-- now that you've signed up, browse,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.280]   you have a whole month to pick your first two books.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.720]   You can cancel it anytime.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.400]   There'll be no charge in that first month.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.880]   But those books will be yours forever.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.040]   So take your time, enjoy, browse the Audible stacks,
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.200]   find some books you want to listen to, and then sign up
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.280]   at audible.com/twit2.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:08.000]   Play on your iPad, your iPod, all the Apple devices,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.840]   even the Zunes on the Kindles, yes.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.640]   And of course, on your computer.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.840]   They've got a great iPhone and Android app, too,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.240]   by the way.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.440]   The Android app is great.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.720]   You have your whole library there.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.200]   You download any book you want to listen to.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.000]   In fact, for our trip for the holidays,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.240]   I fired up the Android app and downloaded a ton of books,
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.600]   including that Stephen King book,
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.480]   and now I'm going to be ready to listen.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.720]   See, there it is, 112263.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.600]   That's the book.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.440]   Now, we continue on with our trip down memory lane,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.680]   the year 2011 Twit style.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.640]   This was a big story.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:50.280]   Google, in a shock to everyone, buys Motorola,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.680]   one of the biggest Android phone manufacturers.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.120]   Here's how we covered the story.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.800]   This was a-- you know, August, I usually think of August
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.880]   as a slow week for news, a slow month for news.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   But this was not a slow week.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.440]   No, this was absolutely not.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.480]   Amy means.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.080]   Oh, did someone--
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.760]   A couple of things.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.480]   Let's start with Monday.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.880]   Work our way by day.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   Work our way.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.200]   Work our way by hour.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.400]   Yeah, practically.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.960]   Big shock, really before even the market opened on Monday,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.360]   Larry Page announced that Google had spent $12 and a half
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.520]   billion and purchased Motorola mobility.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.920]   That's correct.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.640]   A shock for anybody here?
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.440]   A shock for me.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.480]   Did you expect that, Peter?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.200]   Yeah, I mean, I was surprised.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.560]   It's a big deal because they're buying a hardware company.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Even if they bought it for the patents or whatever reason,
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   I mean, the fact that Google, which has always
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.680]   been about software and services, would get so directly
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   in the hardware business, is a really big move.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.960]   It's a big change for how Google thinks about itself
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.520]   as a company.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.440]   Some people positive that perhaps there's a message--
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.480]   Microsoft partnering with Nokia, Apple owns their hardware
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.120]   business-- that maybe if you want to make it in smartphones,
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.640]   you need to have a hardware partner or be in the hardware
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.320]   business.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.960]   That doesn't seem--
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.640]   do you think that's true?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.520]   And not for Android.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.680]   Android's advantage is so many manufacturers.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.520]   Well, I mean, there's an argument to be made, right?
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.560]   The counter argument is that it didn't work very well
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.320]   for Palm and then HP.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.600]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.240]   But I think--
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.400]   Remember, that was Thursday.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Spoiler alert.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   That was Thursday.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   That was Thursday.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   No, on Monday.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   No.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.200]   Or did that?
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.560]   Yeah, I mean, it is--
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   you know, it's about a battle of ecosystems, right?
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.960]   And it's about a battle of who can create the best
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.600]   experience and creating a great experience really means you
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.200]   have to not just create good hardware or great software.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.720]   You have to really integrate those two things together in a
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:40.080]   way that consumers are going to have an amazing problem-free
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:40.960]   experience most of the time.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.440]   It's a risk, though, to Google, isn't it?
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.680]   That the Samsung and the LG and all these people will get
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.520]   pissed off and say--
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.160]   I mean, what Apple does is hardware software, but at the
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.440]   end of the day, they're a hardware company.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.760]   And they'll say that.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.040]   And at the end of the day, Google is an advertising
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.280]   company.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.480]   Not even a software company.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.640]   Not even a software company.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.800]   And you can see that from Android.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.960]   I mean, Android is--
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.800]   although it is the number one mobile service right now, it's
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.840]   a mess.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.840]   They're doing what Windows did a decade ago.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.560]   And I think that it's going to be really, really difficult
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.600]   for them to take over Motorola and integrate it and create
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.800]   great products in the next few years without shooting
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.040]   themselves in the foot at the same time.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.200]   It was about patents, wasn't it, Paul, really ultimately?
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.560]   Yeah, in fact, I expect them to get rid of the hardware a
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.200]   bit eventually.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.720]   It's been at all.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.840]   They need it, and it actually hurts their relationships
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.600]   with their partners.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.720]   Absolutely.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.000]   Google had about 1,000 patents going into this.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.560]   They missed out on the no-tell patents.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.800]   Apple and Microsoft made an unholy alliance to swoop
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.440]   those--
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:37.600]   The bell, I think.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.960]   --the bell would be.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   The term weird.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.800]   On the hardware side, I do hope that they bring back the
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.600]   Skypager.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.320]   Because it's just a great device.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:49.760]   You're kidding me.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.240]   And a star-tack phone.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.920]   And I think those were two excellently executed devices
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.240]   that really saved the world.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.960]   You're subtly making the point that good Motorola mobility
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.000]   hasn't really been on cutting edge for a while.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.680]   I don't mean to dis-moderola, but I do think that those
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.720]   devices were actually really cool.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.520]   I love the stars.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.400]   In terms of the patent thing, I joked earlier this week.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.080]   I didn't--
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.160]   how many tech writers got into this business to write about
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.240]   patent law?
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:12.520]   Right.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.640]   And suddenly we are.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.880]   And it's just-- it's really--
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.400]   I'm not even a full-fledged tech writer.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.120]   I'm an enthusiast, and I love to talk about this stuff.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.960]   But patents know.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.320]   These guys should just fight.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.760]   They should go out into the middle of a desert with a sword,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.120]   some kind of broad sword or side or something, and just
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.040]   have it out.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.240]   And Larry Page and Steve Ballmer go at each other's throats.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.360]   And whoever wins gets the thing that they're fighting over.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.320]   If it is about patents--
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.080]   I wouldn't want to go up against that guy in a desert.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:37.760]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.320]   He's a prisoner in a mode.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.400]   He's a prisoner in a mode.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   Warrior suit.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.560]   He's a big guy.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.600]   But he's a quick size alone.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.320]   I feel like Larry Page is a little squirrely.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:47.840]   Or Larry Page.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.520]   And he's going to sit there and suffocate.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.600]   So in a battle--
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.920]   This is what I wanted to bring our discussion to.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   One, we're not talking about patents.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.200]   Starting off with a physical comment.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.600]   I like the sword thing.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.160]   You forgot to mention Razor.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.720]   I did.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.800]   I did forget to mention Razor.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.760]   The sword and a razor?
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.600]   No, the razor, the--
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   The foundable razor.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.720]   Oh, the great phone to razor.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.600]   I mean, when they put Android on that, it's going to be epic.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.680]   But it will be 2.2.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.720]   It's about patents.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   It's about mutually assured destruction.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.880]   It's about having now what 12,000 patents to counter,
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.240]   anybody who wants to come off.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.520]   I don't think it's just about patents.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:23.840]   No?
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.000]   I don't think it's just about patents.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.720]   I think it's also about them being really concerned
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.800]   about Android's long-term prospects.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.160]   Well, there weren't many if you get sued to death, right?
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.840]   And Apple's going after Samsung saying,
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.680]   you can't sell products in the US
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.840]   because it's running--
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.480]   because you're copying our phones.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.240]   And I think that's preliminary suing Google.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.880]   Or maybe they'll just sue everybody around?
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.240]   They're going to sue everyone around.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.280]   I mean, I think the frustrating thing
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.960]   is that Google missed a really big opportunity
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.240]   with the whole Nortell thing to come out and say,
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.280]   look, this patent system is fundamentally broken.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.560]   We're only playing this game because we have to.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.360]   And we're going to start putting our efforts into lobbying
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.200]   Congress to change and reform the patent system.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.240]   That's what came to my mind.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.320]   Is there's $12.5 billion just basically thrown away
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.880]   that could have been used for all sorts of innovation
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.040]   because you had to defend yourself against patent laws.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.520]   Or buying every member of Congress.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.200]   Well, how much could they be worth?
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.240]   Like 1,000 each?
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.040]   Well, there's 5-- well, 538 of them.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.360]   And then you take-- you divide--
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.760]   well, yeah, give each of them half a billion.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.600]   That's a cover.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.120]   That's a cover.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   A couple of years.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.360]   The problem that we-- this is a much, much bigger problem
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.080]   that the patent law just doesn't cover.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.040]   Like software.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.160]   And I mean, the patents for the ones that exist to--
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.080]   if I slide my finger across my phone to unlock it,
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.680]   like that should be really given a patent.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   I mean, come on.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.120]   There are thousands of these things
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.480]   that exist for just the most esoteric little things
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   on a mobile device.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.800]   And I don't think the patent office
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.120]   is any concept of what the hell is going on right now.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.840]   Can we patent walking by the--
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.840]   I'm sure somebody's driving--
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.480]   I remember someone patent a toast.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:52.960]   Did that?
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.480]   Yeah, a couple years ago.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.360]   A couple years ago?
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   Does that mean I have to send them--
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.480]   What patent examiner would look at a patent application
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.200]   for toast and approve it?
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.080]   Well, you know what they do is they just look to see
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.120]   if it's there already.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.760]   And nobody's done toast before.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.120]   Why?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.040]   This is brilliant.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.480]   I have a patent.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.000]   No.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.960]   What's your patent?
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.440]   My patent is--
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.240]   So you're part of the problem.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.440]   I'm part of the problem.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.680]   Nick, Bill, and the--
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.320]   We knew that already.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.920]   Come on.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   Thanks, guys.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   I'm--
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.200]   I have a patent for--
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.880]   if you have an RFID on your phone and an RFID on your computer,
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.280]   that when they connect, that they
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.680]   can communicate with each other and send information.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.440]   Now, did you--
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.160]   To do this patent, do it--
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.440]   Do it in your way.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.600]   --you just merely have a concept and patent it,
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.920]   or did you have a prototype?
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   Built a prototype.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.240]   See, that's what it used to be.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.600]   You'd have to build something and show the process at work.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.120]   And that is a much better way, I think,
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.440]   of making patents work.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.480]   Yeah, we did it with the New York Times.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.080]   As an experiment?
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.800]   Why used to work in the research labs?
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.520]   And we prototyped all this stuff.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.320]   And so we had this idea of content following you around.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.800]   So let's say you're reading an article on your laptop,
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.400]   and you don't finish it, and you pick up your phone
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.800]   and we'll weigh the RFID chip and say, hey, you left.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.320]   I love that.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.720]   Send in the rest of the article on this phone.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.520]   By the way, that is one thing that Motorola did have,
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.480]   not only patents in, but also some products,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.200]   is NFC in your field communication.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.600]   Yes.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.680]   And that's something Google's very interested in promoting.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.240]   So that might be some value.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.040]   Set top boxes also.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.840]   They're one of two big set top box companies.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.320]   Paul and I talked about this on Windows weekly.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.280]   We love Motorola.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:21.840]   Love them.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.360]   Terrible.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.640]   This stuff is crap.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.880]   Only made worse by scientific Atlanta, right?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.840]   I mean, these bars are very loud.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.960]   It's a subtle institution.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.440]   Very loud.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.320]   There doesn't seem like any way that they could put Google TV
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.080]   into these boxes.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   What's Google TV?
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.760]   $300 later, you explained.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.560]   I mean, I think the problem is that when it comes to set
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   top boxes, it's not a consumer device.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.240]   Thank you.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.960]   You know, the people that are buying these are the--
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.200]   Cable companies buy it.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.680]   And so if you do something that cable companies don't like,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   if you put some software on it that they're not happy about,
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.800]   they're just going to not buy it.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.520]   Such a Google TV.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.080]   They'll kill you.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.120]   Right.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.800]   The last thing they want is for Google TV
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.440]   to get in between them and their relationship
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.640]   with their advertisers.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.120]   That's the first thing we want, of course,
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.040]   but it's the last thing they want.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.520]   Yes.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.480]   Once again, size time.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.840]   I think swords--
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.840]   Swords--
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.320]   Razors.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.120]   Razors?
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.480]   That's what I thought he was talking about.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.320]   Swords and Razors.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:14.840]   A weapon.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.320]   There we go.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.680]   As a weapon.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.320]   Use your razor as a weapon.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.280]   Anything else to say about Motorola?
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:19.800]   Motorola.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   Motorola.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.960]   Is that the name that we've decided on?
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.600]   I think that dramatically--
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.120]   Google Rollers.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   --or resistance to the Motorola.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   Google Rollers.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   Sounds like a roller rink.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.640]   Google Rollers.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   I'm sorry, when you just go--
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.160]   Google Rollers.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   --what comes out on the other side.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.440]   Google Rollers sounds like a late night TV
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.160]   hostess for horror movies.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.840]   Hi, I'm Google Rollers.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.600]   It's so specific.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.200]   I'm the rich fantasy world.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.440]   That's all I'm going to say about that right now.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.240]   Uh, Googlerella.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.040]   See, that's--
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.840]   That's on a--
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.640]   --Googlerella with you.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.160]   Like a band.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   Japanese monster movie.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.480]   So do they rename the razor the "graser"?
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.320]   Ooh.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.760]   And that's the step too far.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   Everybody was OK.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.600]   The Goo-Tac.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.080]   Um--
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.520]   Oh, god.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.000]   All right, we're just going to stop with this.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.920]   Uh, D8 happened this week.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.800]   Actually, D9.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.400]   D9.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.600]   One more-- one more.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.760]   One better.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.320]   That's the All Things Digital Conference.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.200]   We actually-- we asked Cara to come in.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:20.960]   Cara Swisher to come in.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.240]   I think she was very busy.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.760]   We'll get her on a future show.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.840]   But they had-- they did a great job, a great panel,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.640]   including Google's Eric Schmidt.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.240]   The Schmidt?
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.200]   The Schmidt, who was very presidential.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.160]   He was so mellow compared to his other wonky appearances
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.520]   where he said at least one complete wanger of a statement.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.280]   But he was-- he was controlled.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.880]   The-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the--
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.560]   Scuttlebutt, as he wants to run for-- for prez.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:44.920]   Oh, what?
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.240]   You know, he didn't get the commerce job.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.840]   That would have been a stepping stone, you know,
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.960]   at least some service.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.160]   Here's Cara Swisher just asked him,
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   what-- what did he do wrong as CEO of Google?
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.720]   Well, if you-- when we talk about the identity discussion
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.280]   we have about Facebook, when I went back and looked four years
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.760]   ago, I wrote memos which talked in general terms about this.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.480]   I did nothing about the memos I wrote.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.080]   Three years ago, I wrote memos that talked about this general
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.880]   problem.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   What's the-- what's the problem--
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.360]   The Facebook identity problem online that people
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.520]   don't have a way to create a personal identity
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.200]   and that Facebook has done that.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.120]   By basically giving people--
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.240]   Stealing a march on Google.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:23.740]   Right.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.240]   OK.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.080]   So I would say that's probably the thing that I--
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.280]   I clearly knew that I had to do something,
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.600]   and I failed to do it.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.840]   And why was that?
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.960]   I think I was busy.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.680]   I didn't even--
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.760]   At least you'd say I was drunk, because that's
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   what I always say.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.640]   That's one thing.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.280]   He basically owned up to the fact
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.080]   that he calls it the identity problem.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   And he says-- and I'm quoting here-- Facebook,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.320]   it's the first generally available way
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.240]   of disambiguating identity on the internet.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:52.800]   OK.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.200]   So Twitter has that too.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.400]   So you're @beckyworley.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.280]   You're the only one and only @beckyworley.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.360]   Beworley.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:58.880]   Or beworley.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.240]   Yes.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.480]   OK.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.520]   Well, that's important.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.720]   BWORL-Y.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.440]   You're John, you're the real Devorak.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.040]   I'm at Leola Port.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.520]   So Twitter has that.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.400]   Facebook, kind of, but not really has it.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:11.800]   Because--
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.520]   I have a fake John Devorak on Facebook.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:15.960]   What is that?
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.280]   Facebook.com/fakejohndevorak.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.760]   No, it says me.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.560]   It says claims to be me.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:21.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   Oh, there's a Leola Port.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.080]   That's part of the problem is that there
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.440]   are many people with the same name.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.040]   I mean, Devorak maybe is not so common.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.400]   Well, actually--
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.320]   Yeah, but I know this claims to be me.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.480]   Right.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.880]   Well, hey, look, this is even worse.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.720]   Here's John LaPorte.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.960]   So that's kind of--
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   Oh, I just kind of have a mashup.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.160]   Looks like our love child.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:43.920]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.120]   Search for the wrong name.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.480]   So I said search for John Devorak.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.240]   I mean--
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.760]   No, and this is-- which one is you?
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.800]   Is that you, John?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.240]   No, I never use Facebook.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.000]   There it is.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.520]   That's the phone.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.760]   That's not you?
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.800]   No, no, I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   How could it be me?
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.240]   I'm going to like it anyway.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.520]   But see, the point is, is that--
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   You let a bunch of people--
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   I can play.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.720]   I put you on there.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.120]   You don't have an account.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.760]   No, that's not me.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.200]   Sure.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.720]   He's just making this up to get people to like it.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.960]   But that's why I don't think Facebook has won this one.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.760]   For instance, if I type Facebook.com/LeoLoporte,
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.360]   it's not me.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   But this is one of those places where we may or may not
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:24.840]   be--
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.440]   It's you.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.960]   --be--
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.480]   Nevermind.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.840]   Our situation may not be germane to the average Joe,
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.720]   because for the average Joe creating an identity online,
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.760]   it's not an identity for a public face.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.560]   It's an identity in their community.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.720]   Yeah, but I think eventually, don't you
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.360]   want to have a unique identifier on the net?
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.200]   It may not be John Smith.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.040]   If your name is John Smith, it might be something else.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.080]   But don't you--
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.480]   I mean, chat handles, for instance,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.080]   are kind of considered unique.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.400]   It is kind of bad form to copy somebody's channel.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.600]   Don't you think ultimately, just as we have a unique phone
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.440]   number, will want some sort of unique identity on the net?
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.640]   I think that was the fear is that Facebook was going to steal
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.360]   this or Twitter was going to steal this in Google.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.640]   That's why they created Google profiles.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.160]   But they don't have a competitor.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.280]   They don't have a competitive product.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.360]   That hasn't gone anywhere.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.200]   No.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:10.640]   No.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.120]   I thought it might.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.360]   I don't think there's anything unifying or ubiquitous
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.320]   that's made any kind of a play for this except Facebook.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.440]   And Google did have an opportunity, and they blew it.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.640]   And that was what Schmidt was owning up to,
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.440]   is that they had the opportunity.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.760]   I think he's overstating the case.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.120]   I don't think that--
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.640]   I agree with you, Leo.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.600]   I don't think they actually had that.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.640]   They didn't blow anything.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.480]   They couldn't do it.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.920]   And that was Mossberg's follow-up.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.880]   He said, well, you tried.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.920]   It wasn't that you were busy.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.400]   It was that you failed.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.480]   It wasn't that I was busy.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.240]   I sucked.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.800]   And good for Walt for following up that way.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.720]   I think he's right.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.600]   I don't think they missed--
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.080]   and you know what?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.960]   Three years ago, did you think of Google
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.720]   as a source of identity or a search engine?
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.640]   They're a search engine.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.600]   They're still a search engine.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.400]   He also talked a lot about this gang of four.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.680]   Well, that was interesting because he left out Microsoft.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.960]   And I think there were a lot of people in Redmond
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.560]   who were upset.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.280]   He said, the people that power technology today
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.080]   are Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   Yep.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:08.600]   And--
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.160]   Would you disagree?
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.720]   No.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.160]   I think his point was they are the four broadest consumer
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.880]   brands that have gone to a global level.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.040]   And while Microsoft may be a very powerful tech brand,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.560]   they have lost their cache as a consumer brand.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.480]   Well, he did admit they were a good enterprise brand.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.920]   He just said they're not a consumer.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.120]   You agree, John?
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.640]   Yeah, I agree 100%.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.600]   I think, in fact, if it scares me a little bit,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.360]   if you look at how successful, particularly Facebook
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.200]   and Amazon, are, it's a little scary.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.000]   I don't want them to be this successful.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.280]   Two more things he said.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.760]   Use a Mac for security.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   If you care about security, use a Mac.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.360]   Apparently, he was wrong on that one.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.320]   Yeah, those days are over.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.240]   You buy in that.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.080]   I mean, don't you guys remember Mac.Simpsons.don't.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.360]   Remember that virus?
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.000]   The way back then?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.680]   The first viruses I ever experienced were Mac viruses,
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.800]   but that was OS9.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.880]   That was a long time ago.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   Yeah, but I mean, that's the point.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.720]   It's like, so we've seen some malware,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.320]   but does that mean that the party's over?
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.440]   I think the party's over.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.480]   And you know why I think it's a numbers, in my opinion,
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.080]   it's a numbers game.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.720]   There was a good article on the ultimate--
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.640]   I'm sorry, the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.040]   I can't remember the guy's name.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.560]   But he says, purely a numbers game,
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.720]   because Apple has now gotten to the point
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.200]   where about 17% market share of all computers,
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.920]   because so many Windows users have become so security
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.560]   conscious, it's about 80% of Windows users
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   are protected by anti-viruses.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.280]   So the 20% of Windows users that are unprotected,
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.680]   70% Mac users unaffected, it's about the same number.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.480]   In other words, the Macintosh platform
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.160]   represents a good opportunity now.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.560]   Yeah, it's easy pickings.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.280]   And it is because these people are--
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.240]   and I include myself-- completely unsecurity conscious.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.640]   Yeah, living in a fantasy land also.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.320]   I think that it's a self-selecting, more affluent
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.320]   community, because the computers are more expensive.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:56.880]   Think about that.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.600]   If you can hit the Mac, people don't you want to.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.640]   Although I keep saying-- and I keep waiting for it.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.880]   The real gold-- the pot of gold is in the cell phone,
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.760]   an iPhone.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.720]   The minute you can figure out a way to get on somebody's iPhone,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.760]   you've made it.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.600]   Gold and--
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.120]   Everything's on it.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.800]   You know, John was telling me that there's
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.960]   a market in New York City for taxi cabs, for lost phones.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.440]   Taxi drivers know exactly where to go to sell a--
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.760]   you drive up in the guy in the corner, give you 100 bucks,
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.160]   and they give you more money if you've popped the battery.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.280]   And so what they're not looking for the phone,
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.720]   they're looking for the data on the phone.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.200]   So if you've popped the battery, the person who
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.440]   lost the phone can't erase it or deactivate it.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.200]   So now the bad guy has the phone.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.760]   And it's loaded with personal information, contactless,
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.800]   all sorts of stuff, credit card numbers.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.920]   So there is already a market for the hardware.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.400]   I think it's just a matter of time before people
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.680]   start hacking the cell phones.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.760]   One last thing on Schmidt, and then I'll shut up about Schmidt.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.320]   No, I like Schmidt.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.880]   When pressed on which was the third mobile OS,
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.000]   you know, obviously Android OS--
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.600]   Why phone, Android?
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.160]   He would not answer.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.880]   He doesn't want to say Windows, and he doesn't want to say Blackberry.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.960]   Yeah, he doesn't know.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.920]   He doesn't want to say Pre, or whatever it is.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.480]   Yeah, WebOS.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:10.960]   WebOS.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.400]   I mean, that was interesting to me.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:12.400]   WebOS.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:12.880]   WebOS.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   WebOS.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.400]   WebOS.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.840]   WebOS.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.120]   You don't think HP can pull it off?
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.760]   No.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.240]   And they said-- who was it from HP?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.000]   You said they would license WebOS.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.880]   Did you hear that?
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.320]   Did the proficers say they'd license WebOS?
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.640]   Yeah, to HTC.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.880]   It was a hypothetical question from Josh Topolsky,
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:29.720]   but I thought that was--
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.520]   That is interesting.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.760]   Yeah, and he didn't want-- it was sort of an SE grin when he said it,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.880]   but you know, he said it.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.240]   I think if Microsoft does end up buying Nokia,
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.000]   and apparently that's been something that's been around for a while.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.080]   It's always been an option for Microsoft.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.400]   They end up buying Nokia.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.720]   And with the way Nokia's stock price is stumbling in there,
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.800]   trouble that Nokia's been having.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.280]   I think this could very well happen.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.320]   Then that's a pretty credible third platform.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.080]   You kind of-- you forget WebOS.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.960]   You probably can forget BlackBerry, too.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.800]   I mean, there's still BlackBerry adherence out there.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.360]   No, they can't do both.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.520]   It's going to cost them $20 billion for either--
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.760]   they're both about the same price right now.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.560]   $20 billion for either RIM or Nokia.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.760]   They cannot afford a $40 billion deal.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.320]   Who would you buy?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   Which would you buy?
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.280]   If you could buy both.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.400]   You'd buy Nokia.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:18.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.160]   Because not so much for the US, but you buy them for international.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.160]   Because you need a hardware play, obviously.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.800]   But now if you want to buy them for, like,
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.680]   kind of changing direction, again,
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.200]   because there's still people addicted to the RIM Blackberry.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.240]   I mean, I still see people see it.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.560]   Oh, Tons of Black.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.480]   I have to use this.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.720]   You know where they use it a lot now in high schools?
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.120]   You wouldn't think kids would use it.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.240]   But kids love BlackBerry Messenger.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.640]   I see lots of kids typing away on their BlackBerrys.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.760]   It's less expensive.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.200]   It's the next step from the sidekick.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.920]   Basically, when sidekick has started to go away,
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.200]   BlackBerry is the next thing.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.760]   And I also think this is a West Coast buy.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.600]   And who ruined sidekick, by the way?
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.520]   Who killed that?
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.760]   Microsoft.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.240]   By the way, if your data was on sidekick servers,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.640]   they turned it off this week.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   So say goodbye.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.080]   And then, of course, there's a Microsoft kin.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.280]   Well, there's always that.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.520]   That's really cool.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.640]   I'm so depressed about reading Steve Jobs' book.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.120]   I'm listening to death.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.880]   It was been made off the leaks.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.720]   We're pretty sick.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.240]   All right, let's go.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.440]   And now there's floods in Thailand.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.280]   Let's talk about Thailand.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   Thailand is up.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.880]   Now, we should actually really call it Thailand,
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.800]   because it's a very serious--
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.480]   So let's go, Nick.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.240]   So have you seen the pictures?
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.600]   I mean, it's devastating.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.160]   Devastating.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.000]   Well, is this because they're not properly
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.200]   planning for these floods?
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   Absolutely.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.440]   And they're over building the urban areas.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.200]   And they're over building the factories and everything.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.040]   They're not planning.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:48.680]   There's no planning.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.120]   You look at Bangkok, and it's just scary.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.160]   Well, one of the things that's happening
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.000]   is that there's been this flooding,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.720]   and as a result, thousands of factories
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.280]   have been shut down.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.520]   Mostly hard drives, right?
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.040]   Well, a lot of hard drives.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.000]   But it's not necessarily just the hard drives.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.440]   It's little springs and things like that from hard drives
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.120]   that are built around the world.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.040]   Parts that are being built in China cannot be put together.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.880]   It's affecting tons of stuff.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.560]   Yeah, I mean, there's people that are dying.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.040]   There's people that don't have jobs.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.280]   There's people that can't support their families.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.520]   There's all of these different things that are happening.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.560]   And environmental devastation.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.880]   And as Nick wrote, it's also about the cloud.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.320]   So one of the things I didn't realize
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.680]   when I started reporting the story was
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.400]   I was looking at it from the consumer standpoint.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.880]   So the next two quarters, they're
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.200]   going to be making about 30% to 35% less hard drives, which
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.040]   is about 50 million less per quarter, which
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.040]   is going to have huge effects on consumers, right?
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.920]   So you go to buy hard drives.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.960]   It's going to-- your computer is
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.640]   going to be more expensive, so on and so forth.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.800]   We're already seeing price gouging.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   Yes.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.560]   Even though there's no shortage yet,
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.400]   people are already raising the price.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.760]   But the bigger problem is the massive drives
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.920]   for Oracle, Facebook, Google, Apple, all these companies,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.080]   the Word of Fire cloud computing.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.960]   So Apple, for example, which is now expanding iCloud
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.200]   and has Syrian, all these things, is going
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.400]   to need to continue to expand its drives as a unique--
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.080]   So they use the same consumer hardware?
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.440]   No, they use different drives, but they're all made there.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.280]   And in China, where the other drives are made,
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.000]   they're at 98% capacity.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.800]   So there's literally nothing that anyone can do.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.080]   And so there's two problems that are going to happen.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.680]   One, they're not going to have enough drives
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.920]   to expand the internet.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.880]   But the other problem is that the drives that exist,
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   they're going to have to take engineering resources.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   Facebook, for example, will have to do this
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.960]   and figure out ways to get the most out of the drives that
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.800]   are there so they won't be innovating as quickly
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.560]   and as much as we can.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.960]   Although we heard this story before,
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.720]   I mean, in the tsunami in Japan, we were very worried
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.440]   there would be big shortages.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.360]   I remember the ram factories burning down
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.120]   and everybody was concerned to be shortages.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.240]   There was price gouging.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.760]   But in the long run, there was some resiliency.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.920]   You think there's no resiliency?
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.120]   Well, in the long run.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.320]   But in the short term, I mean--
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.680]   When things-- when you are decentralizing production
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.000]   like this, there are obviously trade-offs.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.040]   And a big one is, sure, you're not--
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.320]   it's not all in the same place, but it's not all in the same place.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   So this does have an impact.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.240]   Nick is right.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.000]   I mean, this will have an impact at all levels of--
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.340]   in technology that are where these factories
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.520]   are coming into play.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.480]   When you're changing the assumptions of a business model
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.100]   and an innovation model that took something that
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.240]   was scarce storage and then made it plentiful.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.840]   And an abundance of storage changed how it goes.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.880]   50 bucks for a two terabyte drive for Cry-L-L.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.680]   So you look at the scaled up services
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.840]   that Nick is talking about that's built
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.920]   and it's how your Gmail storage just grows and grows
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.360]   and no thought of it.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.480]   And what's the engineering behind that that
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.320]   has assumed zero cost storage effectively?
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.960]   Could there be an unintended consequence
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.940]   that maybe they figure out ways to be more efficient as well?
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.580]   Yes, but they haven't been efficient.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.420]   I remember when I, in the late '90s,
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.540]   when I was working as web startups,
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.380]   and one of my jobs was to figure out
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.140]   how to make a web page less than 100k.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.180]   And it was taking photos and optimizing them,
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.900]   and all these different things are trying to make it easier.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.400]   Good things.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.900]   No, that was a good thing.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.780]   We've gotten really lazy with being economical when
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.580]   it comes to data.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.580]   And both prices make you lazy in every part of the economy.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.700]   And also, when about food, think about--
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.340]   are you some oil?
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.140]   Think about any sort of--
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:08.140]   That's true.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.540]   It's like a five world economy.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.700]   You know, the five world economy, right?
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.940]   I mean, we have-- we're treating things like they're just
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.900]   infinite, right?
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.500]   There's an infinite amount of hard drives
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.440]   that are going to be super cheap forever.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.340]   So we don't have to worry about optimizing our data.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.400]   And we really-- that speaks to the cellular problem, too.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.520]   I mean, we have this massive network congestion now.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.080]   UCA-TNT is-- the service is awful a lot of the time.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.040]   And the reason is because we are pushing far more bandwidth
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.820]   than we really have.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.880]   I mean, we're pushing into far more bandwidth than we have.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:42.440]   When I was in Ireland, I left my phone on accidentally.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.960]   And I barely checked my email.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.000]   And just even the background things that were happening,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.400]   like sites checking, GPS, and things like that,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.440]   was megabytes and megabytes after a day.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.200]   So it's happening in the background all the time.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:57.640]   Did you get it?
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.760]   Have you got your bill yet?
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.720]   I had a phone call with AT&T.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.080]   And I said, look, come on, guys.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.360]   Give me a break.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.120]   I don't want to pay you $60,000.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.720]   Have you ever heard of the New York Times?
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.120]   I know David Polk.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:09.720]   That works.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.560]   Yeah, that works.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.160]   And then they hang up on you.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.360]   We're going to double these charges.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.840]   No, no, it's weird because our economy--
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.120]   we're assumed that our economy is one of abundance
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.720]   because we're in an information age.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   We don't have these constraints of physical goods.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.680]   Natural resources--
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.880]   --that age still depends on metals, water, petroleum products,
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.760]   and manufactured goods that are susceptible to natural disasters,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.520]   which are still events that we fall victim to, both on a human skin.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.760]   And this speaks to a larger issue with the way these things are produced.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.240]   I mean, there is no connection here between--
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.240]   and really anywhere in developed countries where
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.880]   the things that you buy, there's a connection of understanding
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.520]   where those things come from and how they're made,
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.440]   and what the cost is, what the human cost is,
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.520]   what the monetary cost is.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.280]   And I think that as technology culture becomes regular culture,
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.800]   we're going to start to see things that we don't like to see.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.880]   And I feel like we need to address them at some point.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.840]   We're already starting to see them and start to address them a little bit.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.600]   But on mass, we're not really doing it.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.120]   And I think eventually we're going to have to take a look at how these factories are run,
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.560]   where they're run, why they're run, the way that they're run.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.600]   And start thinking.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.880]   Well, I want to get really depressed.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.520]   Have you seen the slavery footprint project?
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.000]   No.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.240]   Oh, how many slaves work for you?
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.240]   So there's-- by slaves, I mean, people
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.800]   who are essentially working for free or are in bondage and servitude some way.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.400]   There are, they estimate, 27 million of them in the United States.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.200]   If you go to this website, which is slavery footprint.org,
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.320]   and there's an iPhone app as well, you can calculate it.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.400]   It's a very depressing--
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   So it's an iPhone app, which is built on a product.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.080]   Well, yeah, just owning an iPhone is not a choice.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.960]   What is the name of the game that was banned from the app store that was basically--
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.600]   it was a game where you played as the children who were mining the materials that
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.280]   were used to make silicon.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.040]   And the last thing--
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:04.560]   It's all really conscious.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.880]   The last thing Apple wants you to know is that, of course.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.360]   Well, this is something--
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.920]   Joshua, I mean, this is something that I think that we kind of overlook as journalists
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.680]   too is look, ooh, look at this shiny new iPhone 4S.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.280]   But thinking about the things that went into this and the people and everything,
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:25.400]   it's something that Apple has managed to put behind this magical guard.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.200]   So we don't know how the magic trick is put together.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.280]   And really, it's not necessarily--
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   Most companies have--
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.880]   I mean, everybody hits--
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.320]   It's completely-- you don't see it.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:41.040]   And I actually did a panel a few years ago, and I moderated the panel, and it was about
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   recycling.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.680]   And we were talking about-- I was talking-- there's a rep, I think, from Panasonic there,
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.520]   and I was talking about the fact that new TVs come out every few months with just the
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.680]   most incremental, minor changes.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.360]   And there's evolution of technology and innovation.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.440]   And then you're just pushing it out because you need a new product on the shelves.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.640]   And I think that at some point in the near future--
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.200]   And look, I mean, this is our business.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.200]   We report on this stuff.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.880]   So it's kind of-- there's a give and a take for me to think about and to talk about it.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.160]   But the truth is, we're confronted with it all the time.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   This is a great example.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.040]   And we see it more and more now as we get exposed to how this stuff is really made and
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.000]   who's making it.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.600]   At some point, we're going to have to start to think about the global impact of this,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.000]   or I think we're going to be in trouble.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   Well, we're not-- I mean, it goes far beyond the cell phone.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.240]   It goes to-- look at Auto.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.880]   We just made cars, made cars.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.280]   We're just starting to slow that down a little bit.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.000]   And this is where you reach the limits of our version of capitalism.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.360]   Because real capitalism would take into account all the costs.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   Correct.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.280]   And so that the market would assume all that information, absorb it, and reflect it in
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]   the price.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   And the fact is, we don't.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280]   Our oil is still cheap.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   Our light is warm.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.880]   It's too cheap relative to how much it actually costs to get this stuff done.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.840]   So this is just the major side effect of an industrialized society where things are relatively
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.840]   easy day to day.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   It's like a tornado.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   Right.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.920]   But even something like subsidizing a phone, I mean, if everybody had to pay $600 to the
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.200]   phone with the actual cost of the phone, would it change our buying--
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.960]   What a case on a scale.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.160]   I think it would change our buying habits a lot.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.120]   And I'm not sure that that would not be a good thing.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.560]   I mean, I'm fine with paying-- well, I mean, maybe I can say this because I'm in a different
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   position than a lot of people.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.760]   But I don't expect things that are nice and work well to be necessarily cheap.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   I think that's a real illusion that everything--
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.720]   Well, this is why Brian Lamb quit gizmodo, essentially.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.200]   He said that he was pushing him to get a good tourism.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.320]   You need to buy another TV next week and another TV next week.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   No, I understand.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   I feel the same.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.960]   I often wonder-- I question that myself all the time.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.120]   And I wonder if somebody were risky enough to say, I'm going to make stuff in the United
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   States.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.880]   I'm going to charge what it's really costing to make this.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.160]   You make it to what lasts?
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.440]   So that would people who have been buying cheap Chinese gadgets all their lives, would they
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.440]   buy this stuff?
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.640]   Would they spend more to buy this kind of-- to support our economy?
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.360]   I mean, we shop at farmers markets sometimes, right?
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   I think we would.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.960]   I'd like to see somebody think out of the mocks that way, to be honest.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.480]   And I agree that it is-- there is some element of that where you, every day, are we pushing
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.480]   this stuff.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.680]   But look, there is a community that's really interested and really wants it.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.760]   Our habits will change, and they already have changed.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.240]   Our phone buying habits have changed, and now they're accelerated.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.720]   But that's going to change in the future, too.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.760]   I mean, as we reach a point where you're not buying a new computer every year, every
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.360]   two years, and I think that we'll start to see that with phones as well.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   But at some point--
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   I don't think the whole industry is moving towards six months.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.840]   The whole point is working.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.480]   We're in the midst of insane innovation.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.960]   I don't think that that's going to continue--
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.760]   It's going to get worse.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   The indicator is it's going to get worse, not better.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   It's going to get worse.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.480]   The only thing that will stop it is an economic collapse.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.040]   But we are headed straight towards that.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   What's the difference?
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.600]   You think the only thing that will stop six-month phone is economically collapsed?
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   Economic collapse, absolutely.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600]   Absolutely.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.320]   No, I think that at some point we're going to start to level out.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.880]   I mean, we're just at a point that things are spiking like that.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   There's no history of that.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880]   That's actually really funny.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.640]   Big Ginger, Victorian lawnmowers are still working.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   Exactly, which is true.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   Which is true.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   My first generation.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   My first generation.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.120]   They wouldn't work if I had an engineering degree.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   I mean, those things--
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   Right.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   But I'm nice for--
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   --they're designed to still cut things.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.360]   You know, it's one of the reasons that I always was resistant to covering gadgets and
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.320]   really always wanted to talk about promoting technology as a democratizer, as a tool, as
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.000]   something that you could continue to use to change the world.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.280]   And it is something that I think we always have to keep in mind is that this is not sustainable,
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280]   it's kind of growth.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.000]   And yet, I don't think it's going to slow down unless we're forced to slow it down.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   No, the system itself has to--
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   The system will collapse.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.680]   Well, I mean, you also have to find-- you have to make a decision about what's real innovation
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.920]   and what's phony innovation, right?
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   I think that we have to start looking hard at what is-- I mean, there's going to be a
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.160]   period where we don't look at it.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.400]   But at some point, you're going to have to say, is the droid razor any better than the
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.680]   droid bionic, which came out three months ago?
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.840]   And the truth is, they're almost the exact same phone.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840]   Well, I mean, I think--
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   Except one is thinner, right?
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840]   I mean, I think--
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.840]   I mean, I think it's--
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.320]   I mean, I think at some point, there will be a leveling out of some of this.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.560]   And there's also going to be a reevaluation of what we accept as innovation.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.160]   I mean, right now, there's a race going-- there's a huge race for who is going to control this
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.760]   mobile space, right?
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.880]   And I don't think it's been completely decided yet.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.240]   And at some point, it's going to level out.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.240]   It's going to get decided.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.240]   I mean, it's like PCs.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   At some point--
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   Remember the-- remember the Amiga?
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.360]   Well, it's absolutely going to get decided.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   Not only--
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   You want to go back--
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   They made two winners or three winners, though.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360]   Not five winners.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.360]   Correct.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360]   And if you want to go back even further, go back to the typewriter.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.840]   And if the first came out, there were 30 different styles of keyboards.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   Right.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   In the end, we have Quirty, even though it is not--
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   It's horrible.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   It's horrible, completely.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.600]   But there were literally 30 different types of keyboards on the market.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.440]   And there was all these good races and so on.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.960]   If innovation continues on the web and in software where it uses resources but fewer
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.800]   resources, is that where innovation will head in an economic meltdown?
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.760]   Well, I think we were-- we reward things in a system based on the cost we acknowledge.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.040]   Once-- if you look at this hard drive store, which is where this started in Thailand, we
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.560]   will reward efficiency again.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.440]   Because the cost will demand it.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   So society, why?
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.720]   You look at the cars that are selling now.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.960]   I mean, look at the price of rental cars over the past decade.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.160]   SUVs are ridiculously cheap because no one wants them.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160]   No one wants them because you can't afford it because you can't--
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.720]   The free is hard to rent.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.720]   The little smart car is hard to rent because the consumer mindset is shifted because the
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.280]   cost is more acknowledged.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   There are those who say, yes, you think--
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:44.000]   That's a great example of the kind of blindness of the industries and of the consumer.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.840]   It's just something that is so obviously unnecessary.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.440]   And now we're seeing the backlash to that, which is in the leveling out of people-- the
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   desire for an SUV.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440]   I mean, it's clear that--
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.000]   I love what you said, Nick, though, that we are setting ourselves up for failure because
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.240]   we are designing things that are obsolete in a year or two or three.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.240]   Absolutely.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.680]   Well, we're going to-- I mean, here's a fun exercise.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.640]   Like, what would our grandchildren say?
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640]   It'll be WTF.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   But what were they thinking?
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.640]   What were they thinking?
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   Yes.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   You thought you could just burn things?
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   Yeah, if they're here.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.720]   I mean, your iPhone's four years?
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   If they're here, Joshua, you're darn--
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   I was saying, you know, things are--
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720]   There's two aspects of that.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.160]   You know, we have a book, thank God, that says, "I live in the future because we're still
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160]   here."
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160]   Let's ask the guy.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160]   He's from the future, Nick built.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160]   Thank you.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   Thank you.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.640]   I took my time machine in this morning.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:42.880]   You know, this is important from a technical point of view because of the cutting off of
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   the Internet.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880]   Of course, it's a big political story.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.320]   But I think from a technical point of view, it's interesting, especially since Joe Lieberman
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:55.200]   of Connecticut and Susan Collins from-- I think from Florida proposed--
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.600]   Collins is from the New England, I believe.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   You might be right.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   Proposed this internet kill switch.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.600]   Yeah, S3480.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.320]   Now, it was last Congress, but they say they're going to bring it in this Congress, is it?
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.000]   And it really-- she's from Maine, that's right.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.600]   And it really does-- this is a very dramatic example of why such legislation might be a
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   really bad idea.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.560]   Well, it's a bad idea from the get-go, but it's funny to watch the chatroom go on and
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.840]   on about, ah, it's not possible.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.680]   The fact of the matter is with this government and the kind of rules they've got in play
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   when it comes to--
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   It's a lot easier if it's a totalitarian.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.160]   Well, yeah, but at the same time, let's put it this way.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.800]   They put out the word-- and by the way, there's a lot of black boxes on a lot of these major
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   ISPs nowadays, especially like AT&T's got one over in San Francisco at that CIA headquarters
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.520]   and that crazy building on 2nd Street.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.400]   Anyway, say you're a CEO of one of the big companies and you have like a-- somebody calls
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.520]   you from Homeland Security and says, "Shut down the--"
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.520]   What are you going to do?
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.520]   What are you going to do?
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   No.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.520]   And then end up in Gitmo.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.760]   I mean, they throw you in jail.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.560]   But this internet kill switch would-- I presume effectively put a kill switch in each of these
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.520]   places and you wouldn't have to ask.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   You just say.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520]   You had the president--
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.600]   I'm sure that there would be a box on the network and they just pushed them--
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.600]   Push the button.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.760]   And they would go to these boxes and it was essentially just shut down the machines.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.280]   A pretty hard press to think of a compelling security reason why you would want to do that.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.880]   There are a lot of talking about that.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   It's interesting that they bring it up right now, of course, like with horrible timing.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   Why would they bring this up?
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.320]   It's such a bad-- it's like the worst possible time.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.800]   You and Mubarak together at last, yeah.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.720]   But I mean, they're talking about how the details of this that they would use it for,
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.640]   things like if there was some kind of terrorist incident and then they needed to shut down.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.200]   People were attacking the thing that keeps the Hoover Dam up and running and stuff.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.200]   They would need to shut down the network.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.200]   Well, yeah.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.200]   And they definitely don't want Leo to port on Comcast if somebody's attacking the Hoover
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.440]   Dam because boy, that could be trouble.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   Well, there's--
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.240]   But yeah, I agree with that theory, by the way.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   There could be some massive--
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.240]   Like a bug.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.240]   A stuck-snit kind of--
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.240]   A stuck-snit kind of-- Something ruining the country and they had to reboot everything.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.200]   Well, I think our internet reboot switch is a great idea.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.760]   This is the oldest excuse in the world.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.160]   There's going to be some terrorist attacks that we have to shut down.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.760]   They shut down that.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.720]   Break into people's homes to steal information.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.560]   This has been going on since the beginning of time.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.760]   And as much as I am concerned about terrorism, I would rather we put our energy into a shoring
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.160]   up the Hoover Dam.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.240]   So it's extremely difficult to make it happen.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.240]   Then shutting down the entire net.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.080]   Better to be safe than one.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   Sorry, Larry.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080]   Better to be safe than sorry.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.880]   Gee, we're trying to disrupt American business.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.640]   Let's just shut down the internet.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.560]   Who's going to win that battle?
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   The artist technical article on this was pretty good, though.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.200]   All the technical details of how potentially they actually did this in Egypt, going into
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   all the nuts and bolts of it.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.880]   But they bring up the point at the end that how much more difficult it would be actually
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.000]   to do this in the United States simply because it's such a bigger country, space wise.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.560]   We're not centralized.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560]   Right, right.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.000]   Everything in European countries and in Egypt too is run through the capital city for the
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   internet, it sounds like.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.040]   Whereas in the United States, it's all the different wires coming in from overseas that
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.760]   they have a bunch of different hubs that would have to basically do this all to at once.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.040]   It would take a lot more time.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:30.400]   I remember when I was in Egypt, I believe that they said that there is basically one under
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.480]   sea cable going from the Mediterranean to Alexandria that connects the entire country.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.760]   So it isn't so difficult.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.520]   And it's nowhere near the complexity would be in the US.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.760]   You know, the interesting thing is when the internet was first created, the reason they
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.720]   did this distributed processing was to avoid.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.000]   We were worried about the Soviets, right, cutting out our communication.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.920]   The whole concept of the internet is to avoid the ability for one country to basically cut
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   it.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.120]   Obviously, it can be done within that country.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.160]   We saw that this week.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.720]   That architecture is long gone.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.920]   It's a lot more centralized than it used to be.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.240]   There are only a few backbones.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.640]   There's a few interconnects.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   I don't know.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   This is a great article.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   You're right, MG.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.040]   A really good article in the Law and Disorder column of Ars Technica.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.600]   Speaking about how they do this, I don't think it's quite as easy here.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.760]   However, it doesn't mean people aren't going to debate the need for a kill switch.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.640]   It just seems like a terrible idea.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.360]   Larry, you said that people are finding ways to get online.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   You actually have an article on Larry's World about this.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   Sure.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.240]   I don't even know if I own a dial-up modem.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.000]   I'll have to go look at my closet.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.200]   I know Sean has one, but I have a box to it.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.280]   I think that it is Hayes Autograph.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.280]   Yeah, Hayes Autograph modem.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.080]   I think I'm going to dust it off if I can find it because that is certainly one way they
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.600]   dialed into overseas ISPs.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:57.040]   It's one way, Larry, but to be honest about it, I wonder if I could hook the thing up and
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.000]   actually remember how to use it.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   It's hard to use it.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   I just remember.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.800]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:10.240]   Part of it is you can use a cell phone too to be able to do it.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240]   Right?
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240]   There's a way that people do it.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240]   The cell phone networks work.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   You could.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240]   And they do, of course, now.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:19.040]   And where I'm saying tweets as we speak from people on the ground in Egypt that are out
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.960]   there again, tweeting through their cell phones.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.520]   By the way, Edward Armiro would never have succeeded in journalism today because I
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.080]   can't see him saying, I'm seeing tweets as we speak coming in from all over the world.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.640]   So what they're doing on the networks and CNN and all the rest of them just show the
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   tweets.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.320]   I can go to the computer and look at tweets on my own time.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.360]   CBS this morning, they had a big tweet deck and they showed all the different feeds coming
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360]   in.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.520]   It was very impressive, of course.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.240]   But you know, if people are tweeting him from the ground, this one blogger, let me see
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.240]   if I can get his name.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   Whale Abbas, he's a W-A-E-L-A-B-B-A-S.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.360]   And he's blogging from the ground, sending pictures.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.320]   And he was dark for a while, but he's back up.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.720]   So there are people doing it.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.280]   And even during the time when it was supposedly banned completely, people were doing it.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.040]   So as I said, you somehow get through also ham radio connections.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.040]   Yes.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.400]   Ham radio is going to be the saving grace of the whole thing.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400]   GPRS, baby.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   Yep.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   Point to point.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   Point.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   No central server.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.960]   I just think it's really interesting that information has become like water.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.960]   It just will flow.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.720]   It will find the cracks and it will come up.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.520]   You know, the thing that has to be done, by the way, and there's a bunch of hams that
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.800]   apparently listen to this podcast.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:37.160]   Is that they are basically throttle internet connectivity through the ham frequencies.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160]   And I think that needs to change.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.920]   I mean, they should have faster bandwidth.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.160]   It's very slow, right?
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.160]   It's like ridiculous.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.360]   But it's better than not.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.400]   I mean, look, we're spoiled.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.160]   If there's a revolution, we won't be trying to watch Netflix.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.240]   That's not really the issue here.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.600]   It's probably efficient to send email.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   And hams have been great in every disaster.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.280]   And it's clear because you can't create a barrier to a ham operator.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.280]   Well, they could try to jam their frequencies, but it's point to point.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.560]   It's not going through a server.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.320]   Kids learn Morse code.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320]   That's all I could say.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.840]   You don't need that anymore for a life.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   I know.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840]   I know.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.840]   You don't, but it's still handy.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.840]   You still handy.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.040]   Thank you for directing me because, frankly, I was going to get the email.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.520]   So I never, you never want to mess with a ham.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.120]   So what anything else to talk about with this Egyptian story?
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   Should we move on?
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   I think it's a fascinating story.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.280]   I think it's over covered.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.120]   I think we should let us shake out a week.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.240]   And when you get back from Antarctica, we can talk about it more.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.640]   You love this and I'm going to Antarctica, don't you?
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.040]   I think it's fascinating that this is on our beat.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.320]   I mean, those of us who are tech journalists.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.320]   Finally.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   Clearly.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   Yeah, I mean, finally we get to say something relevant.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.520]   Finally, something to talk about other than Zuckerberg sweatshirt.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.200]   Although I have to say the president of the union was also on our beat.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   He actually gave a talk on technology issues.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.160]   And he, I thought that was really interesting for the second year of Rome.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.640]   He did a shout out to Facebook and Google and he talked a lot about his fantasy that
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.480]   we're going to get 98% to high speed wireless internet access within five years.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.480]   Good luck.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.480]   Fantastic.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.920]   But he certainly, he certainly painted a very optimistic picture of technology.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:29.920]   And ironically, it was just right on the verge of what's happening in Egypt.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.720]   Who is chameleon air?
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.720]   And Jesus.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.520]   I asked, I'm like, why does he keep coming?
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.440]   I'm going to say this on the car right up here.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.440]   I think he's topiary actually.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.560]   I tech conferences.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.800]   He's been like on panels.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]   It's a great name.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   I don't know what it means.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.880]   I asked him, why do we keep talking about chameleon air?
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.680]   I don't know one of his songs and empty says because he goes to every conference.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.520]   I said, why is he going to every tech conferences?
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.320]   You don't know all the words to ride and dirty?
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   No, I don't.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.320]   He's the bride and dirty guy.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.120]   I thought he was the backup one.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.440]   This is why Spotify was invented.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.680]   I only know the weirdo version.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.680]   White nerdy.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.680]   White nerdy.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.680]   I didn't even know that that was a chameleon air spoof.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.480]   Apparently, that's the only one I know.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.000]   So he's maybe not that song.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   I know that song.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   Is that his famous song?
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.080]   Yeah, I think he won a Grammy for it.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   I don't know if it matters for that.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   He's not on Spotify.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.080]   I don't know if the kids are listening to these days.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.080]   Oh, no, loading is loading.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.080]   Spotify is still loading.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.160]   So what is he going to also win a crunchy for best hip hop star in the tech community?
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   He does.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.320]   He's on his way.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.560]   He says, I've used Android devices and they suck.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Okay.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560]   So he came to-
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560]   Was it stripped?
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:38.400]   No, it was our smaller mobile crunch up event thing on Friday down in Palo Alto at
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.280]   day well off this actually.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.560]   He got up at the very end of the conference.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.560]   He got the-
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.560]   I got it.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.120]   You can pump it up in the house and we're going to have a dance party right after MG
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.360]   explains to that.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.880]   And so he got up and like I was saying earlier, we had a Mitzaus Duarte from Android up there
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:01.640]   and chameleon air asked him just right to his face, just said basically, I've tried
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.440]   to use so many Android devices out there and they all suck.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.240]   So this guy is like you guys?
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.240]   What's-
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.240]   What's coming on there?
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.240]   Birth name.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.240]   Do we know?
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.880]   It's on his crunch base for a fight.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.720]   He has a crunch base bro.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   It's just funny when we-
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.880]   And then Camillion are asked, this is riding dirty.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.360]   Alright everybody, let's go.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.000]   Is this going to get filthy in a minute?
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   I don't know.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   I've never heard this.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   This is from everybody wants a thug.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Camillion air.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   They see me rolling.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   They hate me.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   I don't know.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   What's rolling in?
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   No.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   You're trying to catch me riding.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   I'm trying to get you.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   I'm trying to get you.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   I don't think I should explain the context behind this song.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.080]   It's about, but you might be able to use your imagination.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.280]   I thought it was just, you know, when you do your whole exhaust pipe or something.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   You ride in dirty.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   Maybe you didn't use mobile oil.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   Right.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.280]   You didn't get your smog check.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.280]   No smog check.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.280]   No smog check.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280]   No.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280]   It's unleaded option.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.280]   I'm really thinking.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280]   He's right there.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280]   Cam made bad dancer.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280]   I'm glad that's over.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.920]   Camillion air pleads with Android design to lead to give him a really decent device.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.120]   My favorite, but Camillion air kept pressing.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.440]   He wanted a single clear answer.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.400]   Which Android device should he use?
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   This is the Duarte guy.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   This is Sicilian.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   He basically told him, you know, stay tuned.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.560]   We're going to have some better devices coming out for you.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.080]   I'm hoping the police have been there.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.080]   Stock answers have always been the answer.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   Yes.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080]   Yes.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.080]   Right.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   I love said Duarte.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080]   That's good.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.680]   It was a great, it was a fun moment though.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.880]   And you know, a brief moment of levity.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   And he under wanted.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.680]   Why is Camillion air at your event?
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   Oh.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.680]   He's the...
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   He actually, he...
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.080]   He just really liked technology and so he goes...
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.880]   Who doesn't like it right?
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   I know.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   He has an aperture or some...
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.400]   He was doing something for a while.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.720]   He's like some, you know, start investments or something that he was doing.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.160]   But he, I mean, he gets up there and he's been on stage before it disrupted.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.240]   And he is very knowledgeable about what.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.120]   And he asks the best questions usually because it's like, instead of all of us thinking, you
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.280]   know, amongst each other and we're all like speaking in circles, you know, he thinks more
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.040]   like outside the box like a writer, type user.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   Why is there no good?
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040]   Right.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   I think that's a great question actually.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.080]   It's kind of funny how anytime someone's more well known for a song called "Writing Dirty"
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.520]   or for being a very successful actor or something like that, when they get really interested
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.400]   in technology, all the rest of us go, what are they doing here?
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.400]   I think it's less than that.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.200]   I think we're just more like kind of confused.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.200]   Oh, I didn't eat for you for real.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   I really care.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   Sure.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   It happens.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200]   By the way, when I...
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   I wish more people were like me too.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   Interesting technology.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   I didn't try and search for writing dirty.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.200]   I...
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.200]   When I search for writing dirty...
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.200]   Don't look at the images.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.200]   Weird owls came up.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.200]   Okay.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   Oh, the images?
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.200]   Yeah, don't do that.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   Should I go to Urban Dictionary and look it up?
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.200]   Yeah, you can...
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   Yeah, that might just not up on the screen.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200]   That's where I would always go when you kids...
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.200]   Or blur the whole thing.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200]   Nice.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   It doesn't have quite the...
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200]   This is too fast.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.200]   We need to do a stick with the queens.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.200]   We're going real fast.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.200]   We should get the audience shot where no one is moving.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.200]   Just sit and still.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.200]   They're like, what the hell?
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.200]   This is dead out there.
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:24.800]   I was told this would be the price is right.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.480]   Page by Parker.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.040]   I still don't know what the lyrics of that song are.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.400]   Probably just as well.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.360]   The biggest event of the year for me at Twit was our move.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.840]   We have some video from that.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.960]   But before we do that, I'd like to tell you about one of my favorite sponsors on the show,
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.880]   a great company that we love dearly.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.880]   Squarespace.com.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.880]   Squarespace.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.240]   The secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:01.000]   We've had great fun all year long creating Squarespace sites on the fly.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.440]   If you go to squarespace.com right now, you just click that button and for two weeks,
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.560]   you have full access to all the Squarespace tools.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.920]   All you need is a name of the site, a password and an email address, no credit card, no payment
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.920]   or anything.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.440]   You can set up a site.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.400]   Every week we set up sites on Twit.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.640]   We had so much fun doing it.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.200]   Some of those sites are still around.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200]   I wish I could remember the names.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.920]   But some of the sites people have actually started paying for and have kept them around,
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.440]   which I think is hysterical.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.480]   We've also tried to bring Squarespace sites down.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.800]   The Twit army is amazing.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.840]   In Twit, our biggest show has the largest live audience.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.600]   We have yet to bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.800]   We can bring almost any site down just by saying, "Everybody now, right now, go to it."
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   I'll give you an example.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800]   Do it right now.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   Go to inside.twit.tv.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.120]   That's our Squarespace site, our inside Twit blog.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.800]   Even if you all go there right now, you will not be able to bring that site down.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.000]   I have absolute confidence.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.040]   Squarespace uses a very sophisticated virtual networking system.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:04.880]   Most of the time, I should explain, it's hosting plus software.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.240]   It's really good hosting.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.280]   Most of the time when you go to a website, it's coming off of one computer or in best
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.560]   case scenario when you go to our site.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.800]   We've got four servers and their load balanced across all four servers.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:22.560]   It's still not so hard to overload it because it's not typical that somebody is going to
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.520]   pay enough money to be able to handle the maximum amount of traffic that site is going
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   to see.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   Squarespace doesn't do it that way.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.840]   They use virtual server technology.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.360]   It's very sophisticated.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:39.640]   They can throw anywhere from one to a thousand servers or more on any given site as needed.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.720]   As traffic ramps up on your site, you're guaranteed you'll always have enough bandwidth.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.960]   Your site will never go down.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.520]   It's just one of the many reasons to go with Squarespace.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.240]   It's the best possible hosting.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.080]   Then you're getting this great content management system on top of it.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:57.320]   A system that allows even a rank amateur to design a unique, great looking, polished site
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:04.120]   that has full functionality, social media integration, e-commerce if you want, great
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.680]   looks and feel and speedy responsiveness.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.720]   It's just an amazing service and very affordable.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.720]   Here's the deal.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   Try it.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.600]   Just go to squarespace.com and use the system.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.720]   See how you like it.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:23.440]   If you decide you want to buy, do use our offer code that's TWIT01 for the first month
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.440]   of the year.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.520]   TWIT01, it'll be good all months.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.440]   You'll get, I think, is it 30% off a month for the first three months?
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.840]   Wow, that's a good deal.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.720]   Squarespace.com, try it free.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.520]   If you sign up and you have a variety of different plans you can sign up for, but this code applies
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.600]   to all of them, use the offer code TWIT01 for 30% off for the first three months.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.400]   That's our way of saying thank you to Squarespace.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.640]   And Squarespace is a way of saying please try us.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.960]   squarespace.com, the secret, find exceptional websites.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.120]   Let's continue on.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.720]   For me, I mean it was a big year.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.880]   There was so much great stuff that happened this year.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.600]   Lots of fascinating techniques to talk about.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.840]   Wonderful hosts joining us.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:09.320]   We had so much fun, but really the big part of 2011, I know you agree with me, probably,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.600]   I hope, was the opening of our great new space, the TWIT brick house.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:20.000]   We had a parade, we had our first episode of the new studio, it was a TWIT episode with
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.880]   some of our favorite TWIT co-hosts.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:27.800]   Well, I'll tell you what, we've got the best of the brand new grand opening right here
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.880]   for you.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:37.520]   This is the last show for TWIT, for the TWIT show from the cottage.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.880]   At this time next week we'll be broadcasting live from the brick house down the street,
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.720]   the brand new TWIT brick house studios.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.400]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.600]   There is still time to get a brick on the wall of honor.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.760]   We are selling bricks to help raise money for this incredibly expensive product.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.560]   I will see you next week from the new TWIT brick house.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.040]   This is the last time I will say it in the cottage.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.280]   Another TWIT is in the can.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:06.760]   We got the camera in here, we're getting ready to stream that live, rent buy on the camera.
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:11.440]   In just a moment we're going to take a hike down the walk.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.120]   Say goodbye to the old TWIT cottage.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.920]   I've been here since 2004.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:21.200]   Seven years in the TWIT cottage, it's been a great, really a great place to work, to
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.560]   do this show and to build a company.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:28.560]   Unfortunately, the company got a little too big for this little old cottage, 1800 square
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.560]   feet, 18 employees, do the math.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:38.640]   Each of them has a 10 by 10 foot square for everything, including the bathroom.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.640]   So it was time.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.960]   We had to expand just a little bit.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.760]   We're going to move down the road just a couple of blocks to a beautiful spot.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.760]   It's called the brick.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.240]   We built it ourselves from scratch, the brick house studios.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:01.840]   I think you'll see it's just, well, it's a cathedral to tech broadcasting.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:05.600]   I'm very glad to get to hold high services there.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.280]   If you are listening at home, I thank you for joining me for the radio show.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.760]   I invite you to visit the website techilabs.com and I will come back next week.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.200]   We'll talk some more.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:19.520]   And if you'd like to watch our continued coverage of the move down the street, we have our
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.720]   live cameras in position and we will have our little mini parade and our first show
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.240]   in about an hour.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.200]   You can watch it all at live.twit.tv.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:38.640]   For the last time signing off from the TWIT cottage, I am Leo LaPorte, the Tech Guy.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.640]   Very work, Leo.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:50.360]   Oh, you know what I really want to do is shut the studio down.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.880]   But we always have done this nice tradition at the end of our broadcast day.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.800]   Always, but for a long time in our studio of turning out the lights.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.080]   And I think for the last time, I should turn out the lights, don't you?
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.840]   And say goodbye to this lovely studio.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.600]   So what we're going to do is we have this thing we do.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.320]   Maybe some of you remember this.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:16.380]   At the end of the broadcast day, I like to play this little song from our friend Jeff
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:20.400]   Smith and I like to shut the studio down because I got to close the windows and everything.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.800]   I got to close the light.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.880]   I got to turn off the lights.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.600]   I got to shut down the TV.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.200]   So we're going to do that.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:31.920]   And let me kick it off with Jeff Smith because he did this great recording for us, a special
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.280]   version of I'm a TWIT.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:40.280]   I'm going to get this.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:49.280]   I'm going to get this.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Can I hear something?
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   I'm going to get this.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:08.280]   I'm going to get this.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:15.280]   I'm going to get this.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:41.280]   Okay, so then you're going to be able to switch over to the live view.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   And just a second.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:55.280]   You should go out in the living room, huh, friend?
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.280]   I'm Scott.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   I'm not living room.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:14.280]   Too bad.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.280]   It sounds so bad.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   Well, I didn't plan on that.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   So I'm going to switch to, I'm going to pay the black.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   Then you'll take, get the gear off and you can switch to that.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.280]   Let me go to the bathroom switch.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:41.280]   And then you have a mic for me?
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:39:00.280]   Well, there's a few people out here too.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   This is the parade that we were talking about for the last six months.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.280]   Are you ready to go to the new cottage?
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.280]   All right, follow me everybody.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   We got to do a fanfare.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   Dick, you and me.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   Onward.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:21.280]   So, and quite a few fans have come down.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   But now we have space for about 50 people in the new studio.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.280]   So I think we have a solo out crowd, Eva, range it all.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:31.280]   Okay, and we have an overflow room with a monitor?
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.280]   No, they'll just be sitting at our feet.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.280]   But you know what, everybody here probably has iPods and iPads.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.280]   They'll be streaming, that's no matter what.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.280]   Everybody be able to see what's going on.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   All right, there is a little bit of a line out front as people who arrange tickets to be there at the, yeah, you can take the clock.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   That way I can pull up my pants.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   So we got a big crowd here, people.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   Look at this.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   Are you ready everybody?
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.280]   You ready?
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   Are we excited?
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   Hey everybody, we've walked down.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   Look at this, they've got Twitbrickhouse Gallop premier shirts.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.280]   Isn't that great?
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   Nice to see you.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.280]   Thank you.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   So nice to see you.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.280]   Thank you for coming.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.280]   Hi, how are you?
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   Great to see you.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.280]   Thank you for coming.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.280]   Oh, wow, it's a great group here.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]   Hi everybody.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   All right, now we've got to do the ribbon cutting.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.280]   We've got to do the ribbon.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.280]   Would you hold the microphone, Dick?
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   Yes, oh my, you do have the shears.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.280]   Well, you think we would not do the shears?
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.280]   No, where's the camera?
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.280]   Right there.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.280]   Are you ready?
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   Okay, everybody get your cameras in place.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   All righty.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   Here we go.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   Say, let's do a countdown.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.280]   Three, two, one, yay!
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   Come on in.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   I hope it's unlocked.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   Come on in everybody.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   Get yourself a seat.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   Make yourself at home.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.280]   We've got seats for here for everybody.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.280]   You can let everybody in.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.280]   Tom Merritt is over here.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.280]   This is Tom's new headquarters.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.280]   You're already in position.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.280]   Look, we had to make a riser for you.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   Yeah, it's the new chair is too high.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.280]   We'll figure it out.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.280]   So this is where TNT is going to be from.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.280]   This is their newsroom.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280]   Hi, Azelby here.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.280]   Sarah Lane will be right there.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.280]   Me here.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.280]   And then we can actually slide these tables for guests.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   And by the way, thank you.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.280]   Great Comic-Con coverage.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   Did you have fun there?
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:30.280]   No, it was a blast.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.280]   It's always fun to be a Comic-Con.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   And Dick was there and helped to show us around on the floor.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   He got an ink pot award.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]   I was pretty impressed.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   Crazy.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.280]   Small group.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.280]   So more pennies in the corner here.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.280]   There's some pennies in the corner here.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   By the way, we festooned this place with old technology.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.280]   Tom's IBM PS2.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   We've got a WaaS Apple II.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.280]   But look at this.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   This is a classic.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   And thanks to Mike and Gene Troyano and Roger Ambrose who mailed this to us.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   Dick, this is the last known piece of the screen savers set.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   That rubber bolt was on the wall at the screen savers set.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280]   Oh my word.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:19.280]   And since Roger designed the screen savers set and designed this set, we thought it would be kind of appropriate to have that under glass there.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.280]   They're here.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   They're taking pieces of this set.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   Just in case.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:30.280]   Now I'm going to walk over here and show you some more.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.280]   All right.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   Are we ready for the switch off?
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   All right.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   So what we're going to do is we're going to, for the last time, stream from the cottage, we're going to flip the switch.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   Streamosaurus will quietly die.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.280]   I should actually let Colleen do that.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.280]   Do the honors.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.280]   And then we will flip the switch here and turn on our new stream ematic.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   And you'll be seeing the view from these cameras.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   So let's do a countdown.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.280]   Five, four, three, two, one.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.280]   Goodbye to a cottage.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.280]   We'll see you at the break house.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:17.280]   There is nothing wrong with your twit.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.280]   Do not attempt to close this browser.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:23.280]   We are controlling the stream.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   We control the video.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.280]   We control the audio.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   You are about to participate in a new online adventure.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   You are about to experience the sights and sounds of the new twit studio.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   Please stand by.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   Five, four, three, two, one.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:44:09.280]   [Music]
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.280]   Welcome!
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.280]   So glad you're here.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.280]   This is so great.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.280]   Welcome to Twit from the new Twit Brickhouse.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.280]   I'm Leo LeBord and we are going to have a great show today.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.280]   The first show we've ever done from our new studios to my left.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.280]   I brought in all my old friends.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.280]   My old tech TV buddy starting with Kevin Rose to my left.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.280]   It's great to have you, Kevin.
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.280]   Now at milk.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.280]   Milkink.com.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:38.280]   And to my right, my old friend Patrick Norton, host of Tekzilla.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.280]   Tekzilla.com.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.280]   Steve Gibson stuck in traffic.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   He'll join us in just a little bit.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:53.280]   But I thought it would be fun because this place looks a little bit like the old screen savers set.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.280]   There's a lot of rust.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.280]   It's kind of neat, isn't it?
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.280]   I've been fighting an urge to climb the superstructure in here.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:02.280]   You can't.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   We've been swinging off that since we put it in.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.280]   That stuff is not really something you want to tell me in the middle of a live broad.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.280]   How much rent by, how much weight can that rigging hold?
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.280]   Don't want to do it.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.280]   Thousands of pounds.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.280]   You can have it.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.280]   Patrick could swing on that.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:24.280]   He should be the CEO.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:25.280]   He should be.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.280]   He'd do better than anybody.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:31.280]   Meg Whitman moves in and she says, you know, that Leo Apotheca really was a clown.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280]   Good for her.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.280]   Everything he did, we're going to undo.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   And we're going to start with bringing back the PC.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:42.280]   I wrote a column in Market Watch saying that this is going to be a disaster and I've taken it back.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.280]   I think that she's on the right track.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.280]   She's doing the right thing.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   She's recognizing.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:50.280]   I don't see that she has the skillset, but now that she's there, I've got no complaints yet.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280]   You know what?
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.280]   She's got balls.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.280]   Well, she doesn't actually literally have balls.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280]   That would be a miracle.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.280]   But she has guts.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.280]   She does have guts.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.280]   She takes a lot of nerve to come in to take over as a CEO and immediately say what.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   Trash the old guy?
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.280]   Throw it.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.280]   Yes.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280]   I guess not.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.280]   Exactly what you do.
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.280]   You get three envelopes.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   So she blamed the old guy and started over.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.280]   Well, she did a couple of the right things.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   One, I talked to people about this.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.280]   And it's like when you're in the business of selling servers and you're trying to get a huge corporate account.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.280]   You can't.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:25.280]   You've got to have hardware.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.280]   You have to.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.280]   Well, they can have the servers.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.280]   They were going to just sell servers, but not the PCs, but these companies want a complete package.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.280]   Yes.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.280]   They want you coming in with the services and the servers and the PCs.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   They don't want you to go, oh, and by the way, you can get some PCs from Lenovo.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   But I got to say, HP consumer PCs are not so hot.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   They got to fix that up.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   I'm not.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280]   Is that what you're using, Jolie?
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   I am.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.280]   You're using it.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.280]   HP.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   And I'm very happy.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280]   Pro book.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280]   Pro book.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   Pro book.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.280]   I missed the year.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.280]   It's a pro book.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   I'm not saying.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.280]   I've never happened to pull Ronson anyway.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.280]   And with that belt alcohol.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   It's time.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   That's just the word.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.280]   You wrote a good article and I'm actually very excited about these ultra light.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.280]   Oh, yeah, those.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.280]   Yeah, the MacBook Air competitors.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.280]   Yeah, they're basically.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.280]   I mean, I'm using an Air.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.280]   I like the Air.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   HP's got one.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   ASUS has a new one.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280]   The Xemitive people are raving.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   Dell's got one.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.280]   They're all pretty much the same.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.280]   Intel's been the one that's--
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.280]   They're just a little bit tiny, itty-bitty, baby computers.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280]   And that's fine.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.280]   Have you played with anything?
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.280]   I need a grown-up machine, sir.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   You do have a grown-up machine.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   And I don't mean you look at--
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.280]   That's a mighty big machine for a little girl like you.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.280]   Well, I--
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.280]   Pardon me.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.280]   I was trying so hard.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.280]   You did great.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.280]   Right up to that point.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280]   You were doing great.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.280]   It was one hour, 19 minutes.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:40.280]   And that's as far as I can go.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.280]   That was very nice.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.280]   We'll bleep it out.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.280]   It's okay.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.280]   Okay, thank you.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.280]   No, but seriously, I mean, I do a lot of video editing for Venture Beat.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.280]   Oh, you do.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280]   And some of it, I do.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.280]   Well, you need that.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.280]   Then you do need a heavy-duty machine.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   I need a-- well, I would feel not to denigrate what you do.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   Sir, but I would feel a little bit silly running around with it.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   See, that's what you could have said.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.280]   I'm so used to like--
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.280]   I said, wow, that's a mighty small computer for people like you.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.280]   Because it is.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.280]   It's lightweight.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:05.280]   It's tiny.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   Yeah, as the show goes down.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.280]   Do you think you're doing so?
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.280]   Do you only-- what's the resolution on that screen?
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:11.280]   I have in the faintest--
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   It's 13 inches of square.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   It doesn't care.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.280]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.280]   This is smaller than my last one.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280]   Oh, the screen that you have.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.280]   Oh, the screen that you have.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   Oh, the screen that you have.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.280]   Look it up.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280]   Look it up.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.280]   Well, this one that you have is probably 1366 by 768.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.280]   Oh, sure.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   Somehow like that.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   But that one-- see, I think you've got--
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   Yes, you're for it.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   He nailed it.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   He nailed it.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   He nailed it.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.280]   It's almost like I've been doing this for a few years.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.280]   He nailed it.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.280]   But I think I believe that the "elterbooks" are going to be a higher resolution, aren't
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.280]   they?
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   Well, in order to do things like video editing and any kind of productivity work,
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:54.280]   1366 by 768 is-- it's not enough.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   Do you need a 1080?
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   Do you need 1080?
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.280]   Yeah, well, or a desktop machine with three screens is what you need.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   Well, that's a little bit--
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   That's a little bit--
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.280]   But if you're traveling, you don't have that luxury.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280]   Right.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:12.280]   But 1600 by 900, my opinion, is the minimum that you need to--
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280]   You mean because it's 16 by 9 ratio, right?
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   I mean, mainly because of the screen ratio.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.280]   Right.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.280]   1366 by 768 is 69.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   It's just smaller, 69.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.280]   So the Asus 11-inch is the same as this.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   These are both roughly 11-inch screens.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:32.280]   The 13 is, as you say, 1600 by 900.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   Which is-- that's where you get to have two things side by side, and you can actually
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.280]   still get stuff done because that's what-- if I'm covering a show or something and I'm
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:47.280]   in either in the press room or in my hotel room, I need to have my notes and--
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.280]   --web browser and stuff on one side and whatever I'm editing in.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   On the other side, I can't be flipping back and forth or I won't get any work done.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]   That makes sense.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   Those are-- there's only a couple of thing people care about.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   One is that probably-- I mean, they don't care about CPU so much or RAM so much.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.280]   They should.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.280]   Well--
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.280]   I mean, you know, raw speed.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.280]   I think battery life is probably the biggest--
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.280]   I think the CPU speed and--
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   You didn't, really?
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.280]   --memory is more important.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.280]   You don't use Photoshop a lot or you do a lot of these things where you actually need a little
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.280]   power.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.280]   This has a very--
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.280]   Well, I think we're talking about what consumers, like people who have normal full--
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.280]   --normal people.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.280]   --normal people.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280]   Not in the milieu.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.280]   Not in the milieu.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.280]   Who is going to buy these and why are they going to buy them?
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.280]   The tiny little computers.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.280]   Because they're pretty.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.280]   Well--
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:36.280]   Because it does everything they want without tying them down, without having--
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.280]   And they are desktop-- and they are desktop replacements.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.280]   Are they?
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.280]   No, not the ears.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   Not the ultralights.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   Not the ultralights.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   No, the air-- no, the air is not.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.280]   I don't want a desktop replacement.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.280]   I just want--
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.280]   Something with a 1600 by 900 screen is a desktop replacement.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.280]   Right.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:57.280]   Something with a 1366 by 768 screen is a companion machine.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   It's the thing that you take that you want to--
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280]   You're right.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.280]   I do have a desktop.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.280]   I guess the normal people are normal people going to have any use for a companion machine.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.280]   Right.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:10.280]   Only a true geek would have both a desktop and a laptop.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.280]   No, that's huge.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.280]   You're right.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.280]   I don't know the--
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.280]   No, bull crap.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:16.280]   I just don't think people want to be able to--
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.280]   So is that what the ultral book is aimed at, Ed?
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   Is that aimed at the second computer or is this Intel's desire to create a--
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.280]   Just to-- you know, really, let's be honest.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.280]   It's air jealousy.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:36.280]   Well, it's air jealousy, but you can also say that in many of these cases where somebody,
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:41.280]   you know, where company A accuses company B of copying them, what they're really doing is
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.280]   responding to the same--
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.280]   The same market forces.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.280]   Market demand.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.280]   Market force.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.280]   I think we had the net book first and isn't the error just to--
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.280]   ASUS made the first net book.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   ASUS made the first net book and they had those crappy atom processors in them.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:01.280]   But the market force that they were responding to was people wanted to have one computer
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:09.280]   that did a simple suite of tasks for them that they could take, you know, to a coffee shop
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   or they could take to their friends' house or their relatives' house and they could--
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.280]   And then they could sit at home and do these things.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.280]   And they're not very demanding in terms of the tasks that they do, but they wanted to be
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:24.280]   able to pick this thing up and move it around.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:27.280]   But too, most people don't do demanding tasks.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.280]   They surf and they do email, right?
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.280]   Or maybe they'll watch video.
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.280]   Do people really need-- I mean, how many people do Photoshop or video editing?
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.280]   I mean, that's an unusual--
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   I think the more people--
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.280]   I don't know about that.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:41.280]   I think more people are using photo editing software, not necessarily Photoshop, than ever before
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.280]   because everyone's got these damn cameras.
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.280]   Oh, but that's just pushing a lot on your smartphone.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.280]   And I agree, like, filtering and making your photos look a little bit strange.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:52.280]   Yeah, but that's what's so cool about this is--
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.280]   That's what Instagram--
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.280]   Yeah, that's what it's all built in.
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:57.280]   It's all just a dumber and a sack of hammers and a complete one.
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.280]   You don't even have one anymore.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.280]   It is.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:01.280]   It is, but you know what?
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.280]   Well, so maybe 70% of the market is dumber than a box of hammers.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.280]   They're selling okay.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.280]   No, yeah, I mean--
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.280]   People love that kind of stuff.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.280]   Well, duh.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.280]   But I'm wondering, you know, are people interested in doing desktop photo editing, or is it all living here?
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:21.280]   I'll tell you, we're going to get more Jolie Odell on the show.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.280]   And that young guy, that new guy, John C. Devourok, I think he's going places.
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.280]   We should bring him back on the show as well.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.280]   We're going to take a break.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   When we come back, a little bit of a sad note.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.280]   We'll take a look at the passing of Steve Jobs and how we covered it on the Twit Network.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.280]   It was while we were on the air that happened, so we'll see that.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.280]   But before we do, let's talk a little bit about one of our favorite sponsors, Ford Motor Company.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:51.280]   Ford is a 21st century car company, but not just the cars, the cabin, the inside.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.280]   That's where they're really getting state of the yard.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:59.280]   We were able to drive new Ford's, a couple of weeks ago, the 2012 Fiesta Focus in Mustang.
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:09.280]   And one of the things I wanted to show you was Ford Sync, as seen, the entertainment portion, as seen in the new Focus.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.280]   We were kind of having some fun with it, so take a look.
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:18.280]   Hey everybody, Leo LaPourde. I thought we'd take a little ride.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.280]   We've been talking about the Ford Sync and my Ford Touch for so long.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.280]   And I've never actually shown you how it works.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:28.280]   You know, Ford sent down this new 2012 Ford Focus, not mine to keep a last.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:34.280]   But I would like to show you, as long as I've got it, a little bit about the nav and the services and the app, like, and all the cool things.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.280]   Let's get inside and I'll give you a tour of the 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:42.280]   I just could go for a little ride.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.280]   Look, see this button? Watch. I got my foot on the brake to press the button.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.280]   It's a fob, keyless, car starts up.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.280]   Oh, here we go.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:57.280]   I like this too, when the screen comes on it says, "Hello, good morning. You've arriving. You're driving a Ford."
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.280]   Alright, let's go here.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.280]   Yeah, this is nice. This is sweet.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.280]   Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:07.280]   That's the whole idea behind Sync and my Ford Touch.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   But you hit this paddle right here and you can do anything.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:15.280]   So one of the nice things, of course, about Sync and my Ford Touch is I can connect to a cell phone.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.280]   I've got my iPhone hooked up here.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.280]   But not just as a phone. I can make calls with it, of course.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.280]   But I can also use it as a media device. So watch. I'll play a song here.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.280]   Please say a command.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.280]   Audio.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.280]   Audio. Say a command.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.280]   Play artist Steely Dan.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.280]   Playing artist Steely Dan.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:44.280]   And now without doing anything, I've picked an artist.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.280]   I can do the same thing with podcasts, books on tape, or audio books.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.280]   Anything that's on my devices. I can play. I can even say, "Let's play the radio."
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.280]   The idea is you can do anything you want with this.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:00.280]   You've got a whole media hub. So if you've got a nano, the kids nano,
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:06.280]   if you've got a phone via USB or Bluetooth, you just talk to it and tell it what you want to hear.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280]   Let's give it a try here.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.280]   Mrs. Wallam driving.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:12.280]   USB.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.280]   USB.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.280]   Play artist Steely Dan.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.280]   [MUSIC]
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.280]   That's cool, is it?
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:27.280]   [MUSIC]
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.280]   It's little things like that to just make it a pleasure to drive a Ford.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.280]   I love that Ford Focus and I love Ford Sync. You know I got it in my 2010 Mustang.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.280]   It's just a life saver. Drive a Ford near you and we thank them so much for their support.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.280]   All year long of the Twit Network. I'm glad to say they'll be back for 2011.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.280]   In fact, I'm going to have dinner with Alan Malali, the CEO of Ford in a couple of weeks at CES.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.280]   I will pass along your greetings. If you have any questions for Alan, things you'd like me to bring up,
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.280]   you can email me, leo@twit.tv, and I'll be glad to pass them along during that dinner.
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:04.280]   He's actually, it's a small, intimate gathering for just a few tech journalists because he wants to find out what we think of Ford,
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:08.280]   what we think of the Ford Sync, and I'd love to pass along your opinions too.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:14.280]   So leo@twit.tv and I'll collate those thoughts and pass them along to Alan.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:20.280]   Let's move on. Of course, this may be, I think arguably, there were so many big stories this year,
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.280]   but the passing of Steve Jobs was certainly the most emotional story,
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.280]   and for many of us the most personal story of the year.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.280]   We found out about it while Tom Merritt and I were alive on the air.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:35.280]   We were doing our show "Tranulation," Kevin Marks was our guest,
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.280]   and as always, it was the chat room that first told me. Let's take a look.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:58.280]   We're going to interrupt briefly because we're starting to see some activity on Twitter about Steve Jobs,
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:02.280]   and I just want to check on this because we don't want to fall for a phony story,
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.280]   but I believe AP is reporting that Steve Jobs has passed away.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:10.280]   So we're going to check this real quickly before we go any farther.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:16.280]   There was a rumor, remember a couple of weeks ago, that he had,
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:22.280]   and we will check that and get as quick as we can.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:26.280]   It is, one of those things that's all over Twitter,
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.280]   AP is saying that Steve Jobs has passed away.
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.280]   But AP have said things that aren't true before, so.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:38.280]   Yeah, so we will absolutely check on this, but it is absolutely all over Twitter right now.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:45.280]   And that would explain, of course, why Steve Jobs did not make an appearance yesterday.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:51.280]   Did you work with Steve or was it after Steve's era when you went to Apple?
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:55.280]   I actually went there just as he came back.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:59.280]   So as I said, we've been doing these CD-ROM things,
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:02.280]   and then the internet did for CD-ROMs,
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:05.280]   and so the company I was working for didn't actually jump in time,
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.280]   to pivot in time, if you like.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:12.280]   And the engineering side of being saying, let's work on the web, let's do more web-based stuff.
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:17.280]   And the business side was like, no, no, these CD-ROM things are obviously profitable.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:20.280]   We make a million dollars for doing one of these because you keep doing those.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.280]   And that was true up until Christmas '96 and suddenly that wasn't true anymore.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.280]   And then we was trying to do the web development,
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:32.280]   but with the same kind of production model that we had for the CD stuff,
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:35.280]   which was me and didn't really have a great fit.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:40.280]   And one of the things that I wanted to do was to build the 3D Atlas of the web,
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:45.280]   which was, and we had a prototype that was downloading tiles over the internet.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.280]   Yeah, Apple is now confirming this, by the way, Apple is confirming.
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:51.280]   Yeah, Steve Jobs, yeah, please do a breaking list right now.
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.280]   Well, yeah, actually I'm glad you're here, Kevin.
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:56.280]   I can't imagine anybody better to have here to talk about.
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.280]   That's pretty sad.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280]   It's very sad.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.280]   He's very young.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:06.280]   And of course, MarketWatch has the story right now.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:13.280]   Wall Street Journal also reporting no details, just the fact that Apple has reported it.
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:16.280]   Very sad.
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:20.280]   How much did you work with Steve at the time?
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:21.280]   Not only indirectly.
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.280]   I didn't work with him directly.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.280]   I saw him in the early 90s when he was at next.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:31.280]   We went and pitched the media editing stuff to him there.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   That was when I got the sort of full force of the Steve demo in a small room.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.280]   Tell me about that.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.280]   What is that like?
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:42.280]   That was, we were visiting the developer guy there talking about video editing,
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.280]   what was possible on the next step.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:49.280]   And then Steve walked in with a lawyer he was pitching the next machine to.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:55.280]   And then sat down and gave this almost a one on one full press demo of the next and what
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:02.280]   it could do and how you could have audio and video and full images in your email,
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.280]   how you could revolutionize communication in the company and how this would change everything.
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:12.280]   It was very much a net centric vision in like 1991-ish.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:18.280]   But it very much he had that insight at that time.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:22.280]   And the next was what the web was built on.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:28.280]   So that sort of insight early on that networking was the future was definitely a big chunk of
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   that was Steve's vision too.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:36.280]   Contrast that to Microsoft where they didn't know for another three or four years that
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.280]   the internet was going to be anything.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:44.280]   Yeah, they didn't see that coming and there's a great video of Steve Jobs from the developer
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.280]   conference in 1996-97 where he's doing Q&A with the audience.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.280]   This is before he'd actually point to CEO I think.
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:53.280]   This was '97.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:59.280]   And he said, "I have this idea of things that we could do by connecting the computer to the
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.280]   network and there are a bunch of products that I really want to build here."
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.280]   And if you listen to that talk you can actually see all the prefiguring of all the things
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.280]   that were built out later.
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.280]   In 1997.
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:11.280]   1970.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.280]   He always had this long-term view.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.280]   Let me play a little bit of that.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:20.280]   I think I have it at the '97 closing keynote.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.280]   I think this is it.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:24.280]   [Music]
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.280]   This is the World Network Developer Conference.
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:28.280]   I'll skip it.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.280]   Thank you and you know you changed my life.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:33.280]   And I sort of thought about it for a while.
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:37.280]   It's really rude and it probably happens to them all the time and I don't want to be like
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.280]   that.
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.280]   So I didn't do it.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:44.280]   And in a way I'm kind of glad that I hesitated because it gives me an opportunity to thank
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:50.280]   him this morning in a public setting among people who probably understand that better than
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.280]   anyone else on the planet.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.280]   So it's a special pleasure this morning to introduce and thank a person who has changed
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.280]   so many of our lives.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.280]   Steve Jobs.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:04.280]   This is from the 1997 WWDC.
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.280]   And Jobs had just come back.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.280]   Thank you.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.280]   You're welcome.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.280]   [Applause]
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:11.280]   Thank you.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.280]   [Applause]
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.280]   Good morning.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.280]   Thank you very much.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:20.280]   There's a lot of developers happy to get Steve back.
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.280]   I'll tell you that.
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.280]   [Applause]
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:35.280]   Thanks.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.280]   Thank you very much.
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.280]   I really appreciate that.
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:42.280]   And I really appreciate you not interrupting me for my dinner with both.
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.280]   But it was hopefully a beautiful woman.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.280]   I wanted to come and just have a chat this morning.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:55.280]   I knew you've been getting lots of presentations all week so I didn't want to do a big fancy
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.280]   presentation.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.280]   But what I wanted you was just chat.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:03.280]   And so we get to spend 45 minutes or so together.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.280]   And I want to talk about whatever you want to talk about.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.280]   I have opinions on most things.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:09.280]   I'm going to pull up a very quick order.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.280]   I figured you want that to be a good person.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.280]   I'm going to pause it for a moment.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:17.280]   I'll pull up very quickly.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.280]   Apple.com/SteveJobs, where they are now putting up the announcement.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.280]   Steve Jobs passed away at the age of 56.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:27.280]   There it is.
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:32.280]   Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an amazing human being.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:37.280]   Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.280]   and inspiring mentor Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built and
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.280]   his spirit will be forever the foundations of Apple.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.280]   They are sending people to an email address.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:53.280]   If you have a memory you'd like to share or just condolences you'd like to share.
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:57.280]   Remembering Steve at Apple.com.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:01.280]   [music]
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:03.280]   Apple headquarters in California.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:06.280]   People are mourning there also right here in the nation's capital in Washington, D.C.
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.280]   at the Apple store.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.280]   People all over the world are mourning the loss of Steve Jobs.
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:16.280]   Leo LaPorte is the host of the nationally syndicated tech guy radio show premier radio
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.280]   networks.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.280]   He's the founder of his own internet based technology network this week in tech.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.280]   He's interviewed Steve Jobs many times.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:26.280]   Leo, what goes through your mind on this sad day?
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:33.280]   You know, we were so prepared for this that we knew it was coming and yet it's still such a shock and it's so sad.
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:36.280]   I'm really trying to focus on celebrating his life.
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:41.280]   This is a guy who lived his life exactly as he wanted to.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:46.280]   Was said that Steve exceeded every goal he ever set for himself.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:50.280]   He's a guy who lived his dreams and changed our lives as a result.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.280]   What made him so amazing?
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.280]   Was it his education?
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.280]   Was it his family?
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:58.280]   Was it his background growing up in California?
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:02.280]   There must have been some spark there that created this genius.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:05.280]   What are the ingredients that make somebody like that?
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.280]   You know, he was a college dropout.
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.280]   It wasn't his education.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:12.280]   I think there was something inside him that drove him to exceed.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.280]   He didn't care what other people thought.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.280]   He cared about making great stuff.
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.280]   And he succeeded every step of the way.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.280]   He stumbled occasionally made mistakes.
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:26.280]   He wanted in the wilderness after being fired at Apple and yet he kept coming back.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:30.280]   And I think it was his extraordinary drive that really made him the man he is.
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:34.280]   In your interviews with him, what was he like as a person?
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.280]   Was he easy to get along with?
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:37.280]   Did he like to chat?
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:40.280]   Did he talk about sports or baseball or something?
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.280]   Or was he simply focused on technology?
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.280]   Steve was very focused.
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:49.280]   There's a famous story about him coming into a conference room and somebody started to chat about the weekend and him saying,
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.280]   "Can we raise the tone of conversation here?"
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:53.280]   He was a get-to-work guy.
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:58.280]   When Steve walked in the room, it was really apparent immediately that he knew he was the smartest guy in the room.
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.280]   Usually, he was absolutely right.
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.280]   He was down to earth.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.280]   And later in the last few years, he really didn't do very many interviews.
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.280]   He didn't trust the press, he didn't like the press.
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:13.280]   He wanted to control very tightly, control the image of Apple in his own image.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:17.280]   He was a control freak in every sense of the word.
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.280]   And yet, he inspired us all.
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:24.280]   I mean, without Steve Jobs, you wonder where's the excitement going to come from in this industry?
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:28.280]   That's a good question and I don't think anyone really appreciates that.
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:30.280]   Leo, thanks very much.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.280]   Aaron Burnett is still with us.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:33.280]   He's great.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:36.280]   Also here from gadgets.com.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.280]   Ryan Block.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.280]   Good to have you, Ryan.
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:39.280]   Thanks for having me.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:41.280]   You wrote some interesting things on Jobs' passing.
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.280]   I guess everybody here did.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.280]   I didn't because I talked, not right.
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:49.280]   But I talked some interesting things.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.280]   This was a week.
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:57.280]   Tuesday, Apple announces the iPhone 4S in a strangely somber event.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.280]   I wasn't at the event.
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:07:59.280]   You were at the event.
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:00.280]   I was there.
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:02.280]   And we saw the video later and that's when it hit me.
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.280]   I didn't know at the time.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:11.280]   Did you feel like Tim Cook and the others were a little bit down?
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:16.280]   You know, I heard people who were there say that they thought Tim Cook was a little nervous.
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:20.280]   Maybe I definitely heard people say after the fact that they thought,
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:23.280]   that maybe he was a little depressed.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.280]   I didn't really get that.
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.280]   It was all in hindsight, I guess.
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:27.280]   Here's what I think.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:33.280]   I mean, maybe they knew that Steve was about to pass or that he had just passed
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.280]   and we found out about it a couple days later.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.280]   I don't really know.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.280]   What I do know is that these guys are so heavily trained to do these keynotes
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:45.280]   that they've rehearsed it so many times that when you get up there,
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.280]   your mind just goes blank.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:47.280]   You just do it.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.280]   Yeah, you're just doing it.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.280]   I really actually don't think that there was probably a whole lot of latent emotion
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:53.280]   going on there.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:00.280]   And I think just generally, if you want to kind of get the Steve feel during one of these things,
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.280]   you got to tone it down a little bit.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.280]   You have to be supremely--
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.280]   Not bring it up, but tone it down.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:05.280]   Yes, tone it down.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.280]   Just be supremely confident.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.280]   I think that is actually what really separates a Steve note from many of these other tech keynotes
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:20.280]   where the random CEO of whichever company you'll have gets out on stage
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.280]   and is super pumped and Steve Balmer sweating.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.280]   That is actually the anti-steep.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.280]   That shows the lack of command.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.280]   No, I agree with you.
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:31.280]   In any performance, the great performers are relaxed.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:32.280]   They're present.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:36.280]   They have an internal energy and centeredness,
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:39.280]   but they don't have a lot of external energy coming out of mind.
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:40.280]   I agree with you.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.280]   I think that's true of performance in general.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:48.280]   If you watch that, I noticed that even in just that little clip,
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.280]   Tim Cook was holding his hands together like this, like Steve used to do.
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.280]   He makes the same kind of gestures, does the same kind of sagely head nod.
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:59.280]   They got a lot of media training, I'm sure.
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:00.280]   I'm sure they do.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:05.280]   And I'm sure that probably jobs may have spent some time with them
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.280]   if there was time for him to give him a little coaching on it.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.280]   They have a very rigorous program that they've adhered to for years
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:18.280]   about how these kinos go, how you get trained to do kino when they have guests
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.280]   up from other companies.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:24.280]   They always have app demos now during these iPhone events.
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:29.280]   There's some stories that have come out about what exactly that looks like
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.280]   as a third party company doing a demo on Apple stage.
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:37.280]   I mean, to say it's rigorous is actually kind of reductive.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.280]   I mean, it is just down like crazy from what people have reported.
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:45.280]   Did you see the chair in the front row with the reserved sign on it?
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.280]   I did not see that.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.280]   It shows up in the video, of course.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.280]   It's front row on the aisle where the executives sit.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.280]   Obviously, a reserve for Steve Jobs, whether he'd be there or not.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:02.280]   There was a story, and I don't know how true it was, that Jobs watched the kino
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.280]   in his comfy chair drinking his favorite apple juice
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.280]   and eating rice pudding.
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.280]   I don't know how true.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:11.280]   I think we have no idea if that's true.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.280]   The author may have been drinking apple juice.
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.280]   But yeah, it could be true and he smiled afterwards.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.280]   That's what they said.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.280]   The family said that Steve Jobs passed away the next morning, so I'm going to give
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:26.280]   that credence.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:30.280]   It did feel somber to me, and maybe, again, it's hard to say, in hindsight.
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:32.280]   You were there, you were watching.
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.280]   I really didn't walk away thinking, "Oh, man, something bad happened."
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.280]   It's kind of easy to apply.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.280]   It's 20-20 hindsight.
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.280]   It felt very low-key, but it was meant to.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.280]   Let's pretend that Steve Jobs did not pass away afterwards,
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.280]   which, of course, changes everything.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:00.280]   Did it seem to you to be a disappointment, a let down the phone itself?
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:04.280]   No, I mean, I think there were a couple of factors that came into play here.
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:09.280]   One, people forget that apple has a cycle to their product launches,
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.280]   and this kind of follows their cycle.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.280]   For them, every other year has been the big launch.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:20.280]   The original iPhone was a big launch, but it wasn't the iPhone that they knew was going
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.280]   to make them a worldwide success.
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:23.280]   It was their entrant.
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:25.280]   They had to get that product out the door.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.280]   It was the 3G that they really got behind.
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:30.280]   That's the one where if you look at the sales charts every year,
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.280]   that's when they hit the hockey stick, because on the 3G,
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.280]   3GS was an upgrade.
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.280]   They sold a gazillion of those things, but we all kind of acknowledged
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.280]   that was a minor upgrade.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.280]   Then the 4, again, huge hit, and then the 4S.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.280]   It's every other one.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.280]   It doesn't feel like, for the iPhone, that this was some huge shock
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.280]   that it wasn't the quote unquote 5 that I think had been kind of...
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:58.280]   It really didn't help that some of the sites that had been starting these rumors,
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.280]   as I guess they really started coming from April.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.280]   We heard everything from...
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:05.280]   There's going to be a new iPad, there's going to be two iPhones,
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:08.280]   there's going to be a Facebook application.
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.280]   I mean, there was a lot of hype around this.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.280]   Would it really start?
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.280]   I went and actually went back and kind of looked around.
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:20.280]   It really started in April with one kind of big report about the iPhone 5.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:23.280]   This year was going to be a huge year for the iPhone,
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:28.280]   expect one of the bigger screen, and all the stuff, the teardrop shape.
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.280]   It all came from this one report.
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:33.280]   It all, I think, kind of...
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.280]   That's what happens.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.280]   It becomes...
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:36.280]   You forget the source.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:37.280]   You forget that it was a single source.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.280]   It becomes like this mysterious...
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.280]   It's very weird.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.280]   And we all believe it.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.280]   But I think this was a huge launch, mainly...
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.280]   You do, Mike.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.280]   I do, mainly because of Siri.
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:50.280]   And from a business perspective, which I think is mainly what Ryan is talking about,
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.280]   it's a slight continuation of the trajectory that started previously.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.280]   But from a cultural perspective, I think ten years from now,
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.280]   we're all going to be talking to our computers, all of our computers,
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.280]   to artificial intelligence agents like Star Trek.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.280]   And I think that this will be traceable back to this moment.
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:10.280]   This was the day that started.
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:11.280]   Exactly.
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:12.280]   Now the Android...
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.280]   The Android doesn't talk back to you.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.280]   Android didn't mainstream it.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.280]   We remember the mainstreamers.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.280]   We remember the Edison's and the Ford's.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.280]   People who didn't invent the light bulb with a car, but the mainstream...
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:23.280]   That's what Steve Jobs is.
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:25.280]   I mean, he didn't invent the personal computer.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.280]   He didn't invent the GUI.
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.280]   He didn't invent the MP3 player.
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:29.280]   He didn't invent the smartphone.
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:30.280]   He didn't even invent the tablet.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.280]   So this is a new interface like the iPhone introduced the touch interface to the world.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:38.280]   Again, there was already devices out there that had multi-touch interfaces.
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.280]   But the iPhone means...
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:40.280]   This would be the popularization.
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:41.280]   Right.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.280]   In the future when we're using, you know, five years, ten years from now,
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:47.280]   our desktops are going to be like iPads with Siri.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:50.280]   That's how we interact with our computers with touch and voice.
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.280]   And I'll be traceable back to this announcement and the 2007 iPhone announcement.
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.280]   Well, you and I have been around a while.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.280]   And of course we've been saying both, I'm sure, for years that the GUI,
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:05.280]   the user interface hasn't changed since 1984 when Apple came out with the mouse
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:06.280]   and Windows interface.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280]   And everybody was...
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:09.280]   I think we were all saying, well, what would be the next thing?
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:10.280]   And it would be speech.
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:11.280]   It would be touch.
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:13.280]   Just like Bill Gates said, it would.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.280]   We knew it.
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.280]   But it happened, finally.
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.280]   Now, has any...
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:19.280]   Nobody here has tried...
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.280]   I mean, we don't all tried Siri, but nobody here tried the new Siri assistant.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:26.280]   Well, if I had tried it, I wouldn't be able to talk about it.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:27.280]   Ah!
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.280]   So there's that.
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:29.280]   But I mean...
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:30.280]   [laughter]
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.280]   I mean...
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:33.280]   That doesn't help us at all.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.280]   So Samsung...
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:35.280]   I love this story.
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:36.280]   Go ahead.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:41.280]   Wait, wait, before we move on, I didn't want to say just one other quick thing about...
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:45.280]   Please, I don't want to rush us because this is a huge topic.
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.280]   You know, I mean, we've talked a lot about Apple.
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:52.280]   And I have mixed feelings about doing any media about Steve's passing.
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.280]   It just feels kind of strange.
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:55.280]   You know what we did?
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.280]   And this didn't feel strange at all.
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:00.280]   When it happened, of course, we immediately went into kind of that live coverage.
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:01.280]   We did it...
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.280]   I stayed here with a bunch of people till eight.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.280]   And then Eric Lanigan took over and took calls till midnight.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.280]   And what I felt like it was almost awake.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:10.280]   It was a...
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:15.280]   When something like this happens to our community, and he really was a part of our community,
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:18.280]   there's such grief that it's just valuable to just talk it out.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.280]   So we weren't trying to analyze it.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.280]   We weren't trying to say what happens next.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:22.280]   No, I know.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.280]   We were just talking about our feelings.
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:25.280]   And that was great.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:29.280]   So there's a swear in this tweet, but I want to pull up a tweet if we could.
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:30.280]   Sure.
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.280]   It's got a bad word in it.
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.280]   That's okay.
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.280]   Brace yourself, yes.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.280]   It's from Anil Dash.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:36.280]   So it's Anil's latest.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.280]   Is he Anil Dash on Twitter?
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:43.280]   Anil, of course, was for a long time with Six Apart.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.280]   I think he left, didn't he?
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:45.280]   Why is he now?
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.280]   He's working on a government project now called Something Labs.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.280]   Oh, Expert Labs.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:50.280]   That's right.
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:51.280]   He brought Gina in, of course.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:52.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:53.280]   So that top one.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:56.280]   The F-ed up thing is that every other...
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:57.280]   Let me make it big.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:02.280]   Every other Fortune 500 CEO sinks, people will leave flowers and tributes to their memory
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.280]   that they tie to.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.280]   And that's really true.
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.280]   If you go to any Apple store, there are Post-it notes on the window.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.280]   There are Bit Apples.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.280]   There are Candles.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.080]   This is like when Michael Jackson passed.
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:15.280]   This is our...
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:16.280]   Oh, Malek said this.
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:19.480]   In fact, we asked Om to be on the show and he said it was too personal for him to talk
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.680]   about.
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:23.240]   But Om said he's our Elvis.
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:24.640]   And in a way, I think he is.
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.640]   Or our John Lennon.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:26.880]   Remind me very much.
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.680]   Or like a Or closer John Lennon.
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.680]   Yeah.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.680]   John Lennon was killed in violence suddenly, unexpectedly.
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:34.200]   But it did feel very similar.
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:38.040]   Well, see, I think he's our Elvis and our John Lennon because if he's our Elvis, then
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:39.200]   who is our John Lennon?
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:44.000]   I mean, he's the only person in his class of adulation.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.120]   And I can't think of a single business leader that anybody would feel this way about.
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.320]   So, you know, I was thinking a lot about this.
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.080]   Why people feel this way?
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.840]   Why so many people who never met him feel this way?
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:57.120]   And I think there are a lot of reasons.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:00.480]   You know, I personally consider myself very fortunate to have crossed paths with him on
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:01.480]   a number of occasions.
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:02.960]   Did you get to interview him?
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:03.960]   I've never gotten to interview him.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:04.960]   Very few people.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:05.960]   It was anti-press.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:06.960]   It was very difficult.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:09.200]   Paul Mossberg liked the only and David Pogue.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.200]   The only guy too.
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:11.200]   I don't think Pogue is ever actually.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:12.200]   No, he is.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:13.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:14.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.280]   You know, people feel the sense of connection with Steve, I think maybe through the keynotes.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.080]   But I think it actually came most from the products.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.920]   And I was thinking about why this is.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:28.400]   And you know, part of his Steve's goal with every product that he made was to create
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.560]   something that I think that he felt people could connect to.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.960]   And that was intuitive.
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.480]   And yet he didn't do focus groups.
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:38.480]   He didn't ask people.
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:42.200]   He said, "You should never ask a consumer what they want because they'll tell you they
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:44.720]   want what they've got now only better, faster, cheaper."
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:46.120]   I love Kawasaki's comment.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:47.120]   Wasn't that great?
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:51.720]   That an Apple focus group is the left side of Steve Jobs's brain talking to the right
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:52.720]   side.
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:19:01.360]   You know, and I think what we wound up with in the end was, you know, a series of products
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:07.920]   that some of us have had for decades, depending on how far back you go with using Macs, that
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:12.520]   you know, in the end, it wasn't just that the products worked well and made sense and
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.800]   were intuitive in ways that other products weren't.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.960]   And it wasn't even that they were products that we were able to forge emotional bonds
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.440]   with that I think that we, you know, before the iPhone, I don't think people had very
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:27.360]   many emotional bonds with their cell phones, for example.
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:33.280]   This is something that very early on in the early days of Engage in like 2004, it's really
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:37.920]   what drew me to doing a site just about consumer electronics is the emotional bond that you
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.400]   form with a piece of hardware sometimes.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:41.840]   It's very interesting, isn't it?
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.960]   But it wasn't those things to me.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:47.840]   What it was, I think, was that because these products made sense and because these products
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:55.840]   were usable, they made you feel like somebody understood you, that Steve understood you.
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:00.560]   And I think that might be a big part of the reason why people felt such an emotional connection
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:02.080]   with him as an individual.
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:04.120]   Well, that's really interesting.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.040]   It was a video.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:11.240]   One of the things I wanted to, one of the stories I wanted to point out in this shows
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:19.280]   how emotional people in Silicon Valley got as a result of Steve's death, Brian Lamb,
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:25.280]   who was the editor at Gizmodo when the iPhone 4 prototype incident happened, wrote this
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.280]   - wasn't that something?
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:28.280]   - Yeah.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:31.640]   - Markable apology, essentially, the way he behaved.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:38.800]   And from reading it, and maybe Ryan knows a little bit more about this than I do, but
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:45.880]   it reads almost as though one of the reasons that Brian left was because of was the result
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.720]   of the iPhone 4 incident and the way they handled it.
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:49.720]   - He felt bad.
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:51.680]   - Yeah, he felt really bad.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:54.160]   - He called himself an a-hole.
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:55.360]   - I can't speak for Brian.
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.640]   I think he would have to speak to that.
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:03.360]   He's one of my dear friends, and I had a lot of conversations with him at the time when
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:04.880]   this was happening.
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:08.600]   - I think he describes in the piece on the wire cutter is exactly how I remember it going
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:10.440]   down behind the scenes.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.560]   Of course, I've never been able to talk about it.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.760]   I mean, he can talk about it freely.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:21.480]   I think that there are definitely some misgivings about the way that Gocker Media as a company
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.000]   wanted to handle that story.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.720]   And I think maybe there were some differences between how the editorial staff wanted to
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:33.520]   treat it and how the people who run Gocker wanted to treat it.
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:37.920]   And all that stuff is kind of, I think at the end you see that Steve maybe thought it
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.080]   was water under the bridge.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:44.640]   And I think that's kind of the important part is that you got to, at least Brian got
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:47.520]   to bury the hatchet a little bit.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:52.640]   - I love that he talks about getting a call from Steve Jobs when they have the iPhone
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:55.560]   for prototype.
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:59.000]   And the call goes, "Hi, this is Steve.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.400]   I really want my phone back."
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:04.840]   The fact that he called is very interesting.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:06.200]   He says he wasn't demanding.
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:08.960]   He was asking and he was charming and he was funny.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:13.040]   I was half naked just getting back from surfing, but I managed to keep my stuff together.
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:18.160]   I appreciate you had your phone with our phone and I'm not mad at you.
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:23.680]   I'm mad at the sales guy who lost it because we need the phone back because we can't let
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.400]   it fall into the wrong hands.
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.160]   I thought maybe it's already in the wrong hands.
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:29.160]   He continued, "There are two ways we can do this.
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.560]   I can send someone to pick up the phone."
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:36.560]   Brian says, "I don't have it, but you know someone who does or we can send someone with
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:38.640]   legal papers and I don't want to do that."
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:41.800]   He was giving us the easy way out.
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:44.000]   And before he got up, this is what I love.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.680]   He said, "By the way, what do you think of it?"
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:50.360]   And that is, I think that says it right there.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:57.480]   This is not a, you know, I think we often see him as a calculating machine, as a person
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:02.720]   who is calculating every moment, but I think he genuinely loved these products he was creating.
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:06.400]   And he's saying, "Brian, what do you think?
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.400]   You like it?"
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.000]   That is a guy who really wants to know.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.080]   Leo, I think that is very calculating.
[02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.440]   I mean, I think he was charming.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.400]   I think he was.
[02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:21.800]   I think what he wanted to do was probably scream at him, but he knew that this was a
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:27.440]   journalist and this is how Steve Jobs and other people in that position treat journalists.
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.160]   He was buttering him up.
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:33.560]   I've never heard of Steve buttering up a journalist, to be honest.
[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:34.560]   He would do it in account.
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.560]   I mean, look at...
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:39.280]   Well, you know, this is a kind of lore that we're going to be able to debate for generations.
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:41.440]   I know, I love it.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.840]   He is already becoming mythology, isn't he?
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:46.120]   Oh, he was mythology while still alive.
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:47.120]   Yeah.
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:50.400]   I mean, you know, he could quiet a room.
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.560]   Just mention that he might be coming.
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:54.920]   There's nobody else.
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:55.920]   And I think both are true.
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:02.160]   I think he was a very calculating chess player and I think he was also a very nice guy.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:06.680]   Yes, I think you're right.
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:09.800]   I was very proud of our coverage that night.
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:15.680]   I think for us, especially, that it was a very emotional and difficult time.
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:21.680]   And one of the things that's really a blessing about doing what we do is getting to share
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:27.600]   those very profound personal moments with you together as a community.
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:33.200]   And I think that that's exactly what happened that week on all of our shows.
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.360]   But on a lighter note, we're going to wrap this up with some fun bloopers and moments
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:40.280]   from the year 2011.
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.120]   Before we do, I just want to thank you for being a part of the Twit family for watching
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.120]   and listening all year long and invite you to keep doing so.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:51.600]   I promise we work our butt off to bring you the best content, the most enjoyable show
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:55.160]   of shows, the shows where you learn the most and we sure have a heck of a lot of fun doing
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.160]   it.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:57.160]   So I hope you'll continue to come back.
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:01.560]   My thanks to the producer of Twit, Eileen Rivera, to our many, many hosts, including,
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:04.240]   of course, John C. Devorak.
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.640]   And to all the folks who've edited Twit, lately it's been Chad Johnson, right?
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:14.960]   But almost all of our editors, Tony Wang and Jeff Stewart, even I think occasionally, Jason
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.160]   Howell, have edited the show to get it out in a prompt fashion so that you can watch it
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:20.420]   Monday morning.
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:23.360]   So thanks to everybody who worked so hard behind the scenes.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.040]   But again, thanks mostly to you because we couldn't do it without you.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:32.840]   And now we'll wrap it up with some upbeat moments from the year 2011.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:33.840]   Thanks.
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:39.640]   Have a happy holidays, happy new year from all of us at Twit.
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.680]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show that covers your, what are you looking
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.680]   at me funny and funny?
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.680]   Oh my gosh.
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:48.240]   Hello, hello little John.
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.420]   It covers all your tech needs.
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:52.180]   This is our Halloween edition and I guess everybody's in costume today.
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:55.420]   But before we begin, we need to press the green button.
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.060]   Would you do the honors little John?
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.060]   Little harder.
[02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:06.380]   I'll do it for you.
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:09.460]   That signals the start of the show and electrocutes somebody in the state of Texas.
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.700]   So it's very exciting.
[02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:12.100]   Yeah.
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:17.300]   So John C. Devorak and Robert Scobble are out back smoking a doobie.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:19.880]   So it's just you and me.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.480]   Oh, Malek.
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:25.240]   Can I go have a smoke a doobie?
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:26.240]   Go smoke a doobie.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:27.240]   Go smoke a doobie.
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.360]   Actually, that's the funniest thing that Siri says.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.640]   If you say, if you tell Siri, I want to buy some weed, it looks for head shops.
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:40.400]   If you say I want to buy some drugs, it gives you the names of nearby drug rehab centers.
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:41.400]   Yeah.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.920]   One of the ways I would summarize a lot of that is that we don't have to ask permission
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:45.920]   anymore.
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:46.920]   Yeah.
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:50.400]   We didn't necessarily have to ask before, but to reach a vast audience.
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.400]   You kind of did.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.400]   Yeah.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:53.560]   You did some gatekeeper to say yes.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.680]   And Leo was our gatekeeper.
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.420]   We wouldn't just be in the studio without him, but he's a lot more accessible than some
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:59.420]   of the other gatekeepers.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:00.660]   And we don't need him.
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:01.660]   We don't need Leo.
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:02.660]   It's on.
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:03.820]   We have occupied twins.
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:05.220]   We have occupied twins.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.420]   Occupied twins is on.
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.540]   Guys, grab your wives.
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.340]   Grab your kids.
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:13.460]   Grab your husbands.
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:14.460]   We have occupied twins.
[02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:15.460]   We are.
[02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:16.460]   This is it.
[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:17.460]   Come on.
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:21.940]   Tell everybody hashtag occupied twin is going down right now.
[02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:23.300]   What are our demands, Nick?
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:25.300]   Our demands are whiskey for everyone.
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:26.300]   Whiskey for everyone.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.300]   Thank you.
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:29.620]   We don't even have demands.
[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:30.620]   Freedom for everyone.
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:31.620]   The whole point of occupied twin.
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:32.620]   Okay.
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:33.620]   So free or no demands.
[02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:34.620]   Freedom is vegan.
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:35.620]   I think everybody can be pros and I.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:36.620]   Whatever that means for them.
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:37.620]   Chocolate for everyone.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:38.620]   Occupied twin is on.
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.620]   This is the best thing I've done.
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:41.620]   But wait a second.
[02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:43.620]   Is Leo the only 1%?
[02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:44.620]   Leo's the 1%.
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:45.620]   Leo's the 1%.
[02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:48.060]   We want the man.
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:49.380]   We want bathrooms.
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:50.380]   We want bathrooms.
[02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:51.380]   Yes.
[02:27:51.380 --> 02:27:54.100]   Just like occupied Wall Street.
[02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:56.460]   The parallels are uncanny, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:56.460 --> 02:28:00.660]   I think we have reached our real lesson here tonight, folks.
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:04.460]   When you come as a guest to someone's show who's been nothing but gracious and generous
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:07.020]   to you, what you want to do is take over their shit.
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:08.020]   Just take it.
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:09.020]   Just take it all.
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:10.420]   This laptop is mine.
[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:11.820]   This whiskey is mine.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:12.820]   This camera is mine.
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:17.820]   This is mine.
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:20.020]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:21.940]   Leo the Port ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:22.940]   Thank you.
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:23.940]   Take it to see you.
[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:24.940]   See you.
[02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:27.100]   And I think we have the name of our new show Nick.
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:28.580]   Occupied twin.
[02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:29.580]   That was the 1%.
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:30.580]   And get out.
[02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:32.660]   It was pretty cool actually for the 1%.
[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:36.380]   Guys, thank you for tuning in to the inaugural edition of Occupied Twin.
[02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:37.380]   That's the thing.
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:38.380]   To be real.
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:39.620]   Hey, we can move it away.
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:42.780]   Move it out of our view and say Americans don't want to do the same thing.
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:45.060]   Do these jobs that are really hard long hours?
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:46.060]   We have frosts.
[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:47.060]   My nuggets.
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:49.380]   Siri was down for three days.
[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:50.380]   Can we just do it?
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:53.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, how can we just pause it?
[02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:54.180]   That's wrong.
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:55.180]   We don't get frosts.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:56.180]   My nuggets.
[02:28:56.180 --> 02:28:57.180]   I have to go.
[02:28:57.180 --> 02:29:00.300]   Can you explain what nuggets are talking about?
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:01.660]   And how are we frosting them?
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:04.260]   Is this Kellogg's frost like a sugary frost?
[02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:05.260]   Yes.
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:06.260]   It's a freezer frost.
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:07.260]   Yes.
[02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:08.260]   It's a chill.
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.260]   It's a chill in the air.
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:11.260]   It's a chilling effect on your nugget.
[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:12.260]   It's a chilling effect.
[02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.580]   I think we found the name of today's show.
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:16.940]   That's why I turned to the porn thing.
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:17.940]   My nuggets on rye.
[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:20.900]   Really have gone all over here.
[02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:21.900]   Really?
[02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:26.020]   We've gone from the depths of deep philosophical discussion.
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:28.340]   Sorry, the heights of deep philosophical discussion.
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:30.100]   We've talked about porn.
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:31.580]   To the depths of nuggets.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:32.580]   Yes.
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:33.580]   At Leo's nuggets.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:35.540]   We've gone porn, globalization, nuggets.
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:36.540]   What's next?
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:38.300]   Let's let Leo segue because he's going to die.
[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:40.540]   There's no story to go for our efforts.
[02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:41.540]   It's a rye talking.
[02:29:41.540 --> 02:29:42.780]   This is the rye talking.
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:46.020]   I think we're going to take a break and then come back and then regroup.
[02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:47.460]   So you've got to cross your nuggets?
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:52.580]   I can warm up my nuggets with a little commercial from a company I call Audible.com.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:53.580]   Okay.
[02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:54.860]   Everybody, can you turn out the lights?
[02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:57.780]   Robert Scoble just walked by.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:59.660]   No one's saying anything.
[02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:00.660]   So on the, uh, shh.
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:01.660]   Sorry.
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:02.660]   I'm not kidding.
[02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:03.660]   Sorry.
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.660]   On the issue of the kind of fire.
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:06.660]   Okay.
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:07.660]   Shh.
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:08.660]   Shh.
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:09.660]   There's pretend he's naughty.
[02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:14.380]   Everybody check out on Four Square.
[02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:16.580]   Nobody's here.
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:17.580]   Go away.
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:18.580]   Okay.
[02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:19.580]   He just walks back into the kitchen.
[02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:24.220]   No, that's where this first place he always hits.
[02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:27.460]   But right now I would like to talk a little bit about a French square space.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:34.540]   You know, this is ironic because I literally just created a trial account and, and, and
[02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:35.900]   created poor poor Scott.
[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:36.900]   Squarespace.com.
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:38.140]   It's amazing how quickly you can do that.
[02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:39.820]   Well, because it doesn't require any credit card.
[02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:40.820]   No, you can do it right now.
[02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:43.340]   In fact, did you do that when they meet or somebody?
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:48.020]   We were saying let's do an experiment and see how quickly you can create a Squarespace
[02:30:48.020 --> 02:30:49.020]   account.
[02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:50.020]   Oh, sure.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:51.020]   Yeah.
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:52.020]   Well, I mean, like.
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:53.020]   You've done that on your show.
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:54.020]   Oh, a number of times.
[02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:56.540]   In fact, we hold the, uh, the record center world record for the fastest website from conception
[02:30:56.540 --> 02:30:58.700]   to execution in the entire world.
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:30:59.700]   And what is that record?
[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:01.420]   Uh, it's like 20 seconds.
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:04.620]   And it wasn't using, uh, it was using, it was using Scott Johnson.
[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.020]   Was he using Scott Johnson?
[02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:08.180]   Scott Johnson was using Squarespace.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.180]   There we go.
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:10.740]   I gotta press the buttons right.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:16.180]   It's a long involved story, but apparently Scott and my computer have murdered.
[02:31:16.180 --> 02:31:17.180]   They've melded.
[02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:18.180]   He's now bored.
[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:19.180]   Melded together.
[02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:21.540]   Squarespace.com is a secret behind exceptional websites.
[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:22.540]   Okay.
[02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:23.540]   Watch count.
[02:31:23.540 --> 02:31:24.540]   Start counting.
[02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:25.540]   1/1000, 2/1000, 3/1000, 4/1000.
[02:31:25.540 --> 02:31:26.540]   You know what?
[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:30.740]   It takes a long time deciding of a name.
[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:35.380]   Brian is a unicorn.
[02:31:35.380 --> 02:31:36.380]   There you go.
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:40.020]   Dot Squarespace.com password.
[02:31:40.020 --> 02:31:41.020]   Flower.
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:50.060]   Uh, email address Brian, brain at never, neverland.com.
[02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:51.060]   Okay.
[02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:52.620]   So now let's it now I've got a site.
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:53.620]   Boom.
[02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:54.620]   That's it.
[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:55.620]   That was pretty quick.
[02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:56.620]   That's it.
[02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:57.620]   And so does everybody watching Twitch.
[02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:58.620]   Because you know what?
[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:02.060]   Because they have the password, I guarantee you within the next 30 seconds.
[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:03.060]   Oh, you think?
[02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:04.060]   So they're going to have the, it's all going to be a little bit of a problem.
[02:32:04.060 --> 02:32:05.460]   You have to, because I gave out the password.
[02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.380]   Yeah, everyone has the pla, the flowers.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:08.740]   Everyone has the flowers.
[02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:10.420]   Everyone has the flowers.
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:14.780]   So let's go ahead and make that Brian as a unicorn.squarespace.com at xdispecials.
[02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:19.660]   In the next two weeks you all have complete privileges to log in there.
[02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:20.660]   Oh my gosh.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:22.060]   Uh, should I just, should I view website?
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:23.060]   Yeah, let's take a little bit.
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:24.060]   Let's wait.
[02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:25.060]   We're going to wait until the end of the commercial.
[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:26.060]   There we go.
[02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:27.060]   There we go.
[02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:28.060]   Give you a minute or two to mess with it.
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:30.220]   Um, so let's get some, let's, you know, a little more work, but they're doing that very
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:32.220]   quickly within these fast, commercial.
[02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:34.220]   It was fast hacked again is the top.
[02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:36.420]   Oh, they're going to loot too legit to twit right there.
[02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:37.420]   Take a look at it now.
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:38.420]   Refresh.
[02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:39.420]   They already have an in there.
[02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:40.920]   So what is the website?
[02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:44.620]   Uh, Brian is a unicorn at squarespace, or dot squarespace.com.
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:48.940]   Somehow the NSFW show has leaked into this.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.820]   They, uh, they're an active bunch.
[02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:51.820]   That crew.
[02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:54.380]   Yeah, they are, they are not shy about using the squarespace tools.
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:55.380]   There we go.
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:57.340]   And it's even got music.
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:00.260]   Here, if you run all the way down.
[02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:01.500]   We have just created the ultimate.
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:02.500]   There it is.
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:04.300]   This is our new squarespace site.
[02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:07.100]   And you know what the beauty of this is?
[02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:11.980]   After the two week trial runs out, all they have to do is either the offer code twit seven
[02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:13.620]   and this music will stop.
[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:15.940]   We figured out what the offer is.
[02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:20.220]   The music will stop when you use the offer code twit seven.
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:21.220]   Wow.
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.060]   No, I think the deal is.
[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:24.060]   Wow.
[02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:25.060]   Thank you.
[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:26.060]   Oh my God.
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:27.060]   Oh my God.
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:33.660]   Oh my God.
[02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:35.420]   See the worst of the best commercial you've ever had.
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:36.740]   This is the new squarespace.
[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:37.740]   Wow.
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:38.740]   Wow.
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:39.740]   So that just happened.
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:40.740]   Okay.
[02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:41.740]   One at a time.
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:42.740]   One at a time.
[02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:43.740]   Everybody's talking at once.
[02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:44.740]   Nobody can hear a thing.
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:45.740]   We don't care.
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:46.740]   We don't care.
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:47.740]   Thank you.
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:52.580]   It's the new and are you Barbara Walters?
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:53.580]   Me?
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:54.580]   Yeah.
[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:55.580]   Well, who are you?
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:56.580]   I would be a.
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:57.580]   What's your view name?
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.780]   I want to be that pretty blonde one.
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:00.780]   Yeah.
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:01.780]   Yeah.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:02.780]   You'll be Elizabeth Hassel.
[02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:03.780]   Thank you.
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:04.780]   That's the one I'll be joy Behar.
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:05.780]   That makes sense.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:06.780]   Right.
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:07.780]   Like a complaint in cranky, you know.
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:10.620]   Do you find it troubling that Joshua knows all the people on the view?
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:12.100]   Well, he probably watches it.
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:14.260]   That's what I think all those guys at that company do.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:15.260]   You get to be a.
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:18.860]   Everybody at end gadget or able.
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:19.860]   Boy.
[02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:20.860]   What?
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:21.860]   What are you?
[02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:22.860]   What are you implying?
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:23.860]   Leo is a movie.
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:27.340]   I actually never saw a little clip of it for the first time.
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:30.580]   I've always seen the SNL sketch, which I think is hilarious.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.820]   But I saw clip of it and I can't believe how similar Elizabeth Hasselbeck is to the character
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:37.660]   that Kristen Wiig does on Saturday Night Live.
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:38.660]   Yeah.
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:39.660]   It might just be an amazing track now.
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:40.660]   Nobody knows what I'm talking about.
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:42.660]   No, we know what you're talking about.
[02:34:42.660 --> 02:34:43.860]   She does a great job.
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:44.860]   You're true.
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:45.860]   She looks just like her.
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.860]   I mean, how one of you guys has said Barbara Walters is what I'm getting at.
[02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:49.860]   Somebody's looking.
[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:50.860]   Somebody's got to be.
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:51.860]   I must be Barbara Walters.
[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:53.860]   I'm here in your old and your whoopi.
[02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:54.860]   I'd be whoopi.
[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:55.860]   Absolutely.
[02:34:55.860 --> 02:34:57.700]   I've had it with you.
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:58.700]   I'm walking off.
[02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:00.340]   Did you say I'd be whoopi?
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:01.340]   I'd be whoopi.
[02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:05.780]   I think we have a title.
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:06.780]   I think yes.
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:12.420]   But that everyone who watches show is a fan of show.
[02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:15.020]   So now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you a John C. de Vorek.
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:16.780]   Oh, come right to Vorek.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:17.780]   Wow.
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:19.780]   So that way I don't think we have to go back to the political.
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:20.780]   It's really good.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.780]   Matt, if you'd learned that.
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:23.780]   You've got to have a hack.
[02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:25.700]   I've only found a hand at me.
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:27.500]   Matt's wondering what the hell show he's gotten.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:28.500]   I know.
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:29.500]   No one's given me a hack.
[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:30.500]   So Matt, you tweeted.
[02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:31.500]   You had food poisoning last night.
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.500]   You feel better, though, I think.
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:33.500]   I feel better, Matt.
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:34.500]   100% out of it.
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:35.500]   Thank you.
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:37.260]   Was it something you ate at a restaurant?
[02:35:37.260 --> 02:35:41.620]   So I cooked for the first or for the second time yesterday morning.
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.420]   So I assumed it was the second time in your life.
[02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:46.980]   The second time in your life?
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:47.980]   Sort of.
[02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:48.980]   Not entirely.
[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:49.980]   Maybe you should take some lessons.
[02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:51.980]   You're a kid of cutting boards.
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:54.260]   It's one for vegetables, one for the raw chicken.
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:56.340]   If it's bacon, you want to cook it.
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:36:00.620]   And don't cut your lettuce on where you just chopped up a bunch of raw chicken.
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:01.620]   Yeah.
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:02.620]   It's kind of a draw back.
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:03.620]   Wash the lettuce.
[02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:05.020]   Wash the lettuce.
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:08.940]   I assumed it was me because I'm obviously in experience there, but all I made was scrambled
[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:09.940]   eggs.
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:11.540]   No, you can't make yourself sick with it.
[02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:13.100]   Eggs are the silent killer.
[02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:14.100]   Egg's all.
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:17.340]   I'll sneak up on you when you least expect them.
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:19.340]   I'm not sure what's up, Paulski.
[02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:20.580]   Eggs, the silent killer.
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.580]   That's funny.
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:22.580]   Hey, Leo.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:23.580]   Hi.
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:27.100]   Hey, you getting all jacked up on those caffeinated pants?
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:28.100]   I am.
[02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:29.340]   You know, people probably think that's crazy.
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:30.940]   They can't have caffeinated pants.
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:31.940]   Oh, they're real.
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:34.260]   They've sold three and a half million pairs of them in France.
[02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:35.500]   Oh, that explains it.
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:36.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:37.700]   So you're saying I see, let it, I see France.
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:39.300]   I see Leo's caffeinated pants.
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:40.300]   That's right.
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:42.180]   I mean, they're your people.
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:43.780]   Not just, it's not just caffeinated.
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:45.380]   They're impregnated as well.
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:50.900]   The shea butter is, I don't know, impregnated in pants as any kind of thing.
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:52.860]   I could start a bad internet.
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:54.900]   But they are, they're like Spanx for men.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:55.900]   Yeah.
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:56.900]   How do you like that?
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:57.900]   Thankful you're listening.
[02:36:57.900 --> 02:36:58.900]   Mm hmm.
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:36:59.900]   And then I'm watching.
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:00.900]   No, just kidding.
[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:01.900]   Yeah.
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:02.900]   Losing listenership as we speak.
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:03.900]   Yeah.
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:04.900]   He's amazing.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:05.900]   Do the twin.
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:06.900]   Do the twin.
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:07.900]   All right.
[02:37:07.900 --> 02:37:08.900]   Do the twin, baby.
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:09.900]   Do the twin.
[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:10.900]   All right.
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:11.900]   Do the twin.
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:12.900]   All right.
[02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:13.900]   Do the twin.
