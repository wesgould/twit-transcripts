[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   Say hello to Rich D'Muro from KTLA and Rich on Tech.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480]   Hello Rich.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240]   Good to see you richontech.tv.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   Haven't seen you in an age.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320]   Been a bit.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.360]   I thought good to see you as well.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   Thanks for having me today.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.680]   I saw you, you were wearing a plastic tent
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   to protect yourself from the rain and COVID.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.440]   It's that, yeah, that's been a while.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.280]   That's a long time.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   That's been one time.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.640]   The weather pod.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.720]   The weather pod.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.200]   (laughing)
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.160]   They sent me this thing.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.040]   We did a fun video and it went viral.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.600]   And yeah, I've heard the end of it.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.600]   Are you on TikTok?
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.840]   Are you on the TikTok?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.680]   You ought to.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   You know, I'm not on TikTok.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   I have an account, but I have not.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.680]   I think I posted one thing so far
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.760]   and someone just told me to,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   but I haven't checked to see if it did.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   You have, okay.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   You have a renegade social media manager, don't you?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   Is that what's going on?
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   I know this was just a random person on Twitter.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   He said, "Hey, you should take that video you did
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.200]   "and post it to TikTok."
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.120]   And I said, "Sure."
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960]   And I did.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.200]   That was the last I thought of it.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.040]   I just, one of the,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.160]   as we have a big announcement today,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   I'm gonna start my own TikTok.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.280]   It's called Lip Lock.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.480]   And I've already registered.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.560]   No, that's not the announcement.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.760]   Also here, Ed bot, old friend, dear old friend,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.560]   from Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.880]   Hello, Ed.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.720]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.640]   Good to see you again.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.920]   From ZeedyNet, the Ed bot report.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.600]   Long time tech journalist.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.440]   When they say that about us, Ed, you know, senior.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.680]   What they mean is, oh man, you guys are old.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.560]   Senior tech journalist.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.960]   I told Walt Mossberg that.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.280]   He said, "Yeah, the senior, the M&M's Grease."
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.760]   Tech journalism.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.200]   Oh, there's a whole bunch of Grease here.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120]   A lot of Grease, thank you.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.640]   Also with this big tech.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.760]   He's the big tech at bigtechnology.substack.com.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   Alex Cantrowitz.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   Great to see you again, Alex.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.600]   Great to see you.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.840]   You have the award for the longest microphone.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520]   Are you enriched your time?
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.120]   This is the camera angle we're playing tricks.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   That's what I'm supposed to be like.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.080]   I should put this closer to the camera to be okay.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320]   Hey, before we get to the news, we have some news ourselves at Twitch.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   Lisa's here with me.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.800]   It's something that we've been working on for some time.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.320]   When we first launched Twitch, you know, I come from ad supported media.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.520]   I mean, I've worked on radio and TV for years, and everything I did was free and ad supported.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.480]   And Twitch initially, when we first started it, it was free and not ad supported.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.800]   That wasn't so tenable.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.280]   Then we were lucky in the first year we were able to start selling advertising.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.920]   We've done very well, I think, as a free ad supported network.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.400]   But we've been getting a lot of, I don't know, I think interest from our audience.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.360]   And I've been watching people like you, Alex, move from traditional mainstream media to
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.160]   sub stack as Ben Thompson.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   What does he call it?
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.760]   The sovereign writer.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   Sovereign writer.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.040]   You're a sovereign writer.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120]   And I thought maybe we should be a sovereign podcast.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.400]   So we thought, let's try this.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.720]   And I hope you will like this idea.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.240]   We are going to continue to sell ads on our shows.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.000]   We'll continue to be an ad supported network free to anybody who doesn't mind hearing some
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   ads.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.080]   But we've heard from enough people who say, you know, I don't want to hear the ads.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.440]   I don't want to be tracked, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.480]   That we've decided to offer an ad free version of Twitch.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.880]   No ads means we need to make money somehow.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.760]   So we're going to start something we call club Twitch.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.320]   For $7 a month, you'll get ad free versions of all of our shows.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.720]   You'll get a special dedicated address that's just for you that is your feed specifically
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.680]   for you of ad free content.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.560]   And I mean, all the shows will be ad free available.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.720]   We're then also going to do another feed, which is Twitter plus.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.000]   The Twitter plus feed will include outtakes, pre shows, special content, stuff that we
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.480]   maybe couldn't afford to do in the past as an ad supported thing.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.080]   There's quite a few shows that we just weren't able to get enough audience for to do an ad
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.600]   supported version.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.000]   That might also be part of Twitter plus.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.360]   And we are also going to open a special discord channel.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   We call it club Twitch.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.600]   And as a member, you'll also have access to that.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.480]   So I think that's a pretty good package, $7 a month, twit.tv/clubtwit to find out more.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.240]   I hope for those of you who've wanted an ad free version of a Twitch and who've wanted
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.640]   additional content, things like the Gizfiz on feeds, I hope this will solve that, scratch
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   that itch for you.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   We're very excited about it.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   I think it's going to be a great way for us to continue to put out the same quality content
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.480]   and maybe even more content than ever before without having to wait for advertisers to
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.040]   say, "Okay, we like that idea.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.720]   We want you to say you like the idea."
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   So I hope you like the idea.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.960]   Again, twit.tv/club, $7 a month.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.280]   There's somebody in the chat and say, "Actually, I like the ads.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   That's great.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   That's fine.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.640]   And we're going to continue to do that because I also like the ads in the sense that I think
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.760]   it's always good to have a free version for people who can't afford or don't want to
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   spend the money.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   I think $7 a month is a pretty fair price.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.400]   We went back and forth on the price and that seemed like the sweet spot.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   So it's worked for you, Alex, right?
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   I think that's a good way to go.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.560]   I'm actually building big technology quite in the same way that you guys followed.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.440]   So actually right now I'm entirely ad supported.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.360]   So the podcast, big technology podcast and the newsletter are free and they're full
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   version to everyone.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.520]   And the idea is let's grow it.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.120]   And when it's at a point where we can build some community around it and deliver some
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.920]   extra features for a subscription fee, then I'm going to go to that.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.440]   That's what I'm sub-stick is kind of designed for, right?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.360]   I didn't really like to do free as well.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   That's nice.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   I think that most of the writers go to sub-stick because you hear about the high profile writers,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.240]   people like Casey Newton or Charlie Warzel or Glenn Greenwald, they immediately go to
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.320]   a subscription because they already have a critical mass of fans that can sustain their
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   business.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.720]   So Glenn Greenwald is making over a million dollars a year.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.240]   Yeah, but didn't sub-stack pay him initially?
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.480]   No, actually Glenn, I don't think Glenn took the answer.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   He wasn't one of them.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.040]   Some others like Matt and Glazius did.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.200]   I didn't take the advance and I said, you know, I'm still like in the middle class of
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.080]   content creators and I'm not going to be able to generate enough annual revenue on subscriptions.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.240]   I mean, my list is okay.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.680]   It's 9,300 people.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.120]   But I figured that that would really lend itself better to an ad supported model.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.120]   And so far so good.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120]   Yeah, that's what we did.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   It's the right move.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.880]   And I think that what you guys are doing is super exciting because at a certain point you
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.640]   grow and you build to a critical mass where it's time to, you know, give some of your
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.040]   super fans a little bit more.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.840]   You know, allow them to skip those ads, give them some extra content.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   And that's what I'm working towards too.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.120]   So I'm excited to see you guys take the step and we should compare notes somewhere down
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   the line.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   This has been the let's go in.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.200]   If there is a trend in the last couple of years, the Sovereign Writer trend and not
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   just for writers, but also for podcasters seems to have been the trend move away from
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:29.920]   people like Alexis Madrigal and the person you just mentioned who left.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   Was it Vox?
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.480]   Yeah, Casey, Matt Iglesias.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   Casey Newton.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.200]   They've all said, you know what, I have a brand.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.000]   Why don't I just do it myself?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   And I think that that's a, I think Sovereign podcasters is an interesting idea as well.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Anyway, we'll try it.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   We'll see.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   We'll like it.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   What do you think, Ed?
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.280]   You've been with us since the very beginning.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   I mean, this is, I was thinking about that this week, you know, as watching a lot of the,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.840]   the discussion, you know, the discourse about what's going on with sub-stack.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.440]   And it reminds me of the early days of blogging, you know, around the turn of, you know, around
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.240]   the turn of this century, when a whole bunch of people started businesses that, you know,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.320]   made them money for a while.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.720]   Some of them have stuck around people like Josh Marshall, turned it into, you know, turned
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.160]   it into good sustaining businesses.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.960]   And then, you know, and then Facebook and Google got involved and distorted all of the,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   all the content business models.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.760]   And I think, I think it looks like what we're doing now is starting to disrupt Facebook
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.520]   and Google out of the picture.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   Yes.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   And I'm all for that.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.080]   And, you know, can get involved without those, without those intermediaries, either in advertising
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.960]   or in reaching the, the reader's viewers listeners.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   I'm all for that.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   Absolutely.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.680]   Anything that doesn't intermediate, you know, Facebook is fine with me.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.800]   And we've learned our lesson too, by the way, like anyone who's starting a new business
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.160]   now, we've seen all these publications, you know, go all the way in on Facebook and Google
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   in the hopes for traffic or support that never really came.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.600]   And so now when it's up to us in terms of the way to run our business, we'll, we'll,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.640]   we'll obviously send emails that will touch Gmail or do podcasts that will touch Apple.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.920]   And maybe people will share our stories on Facebook, but like Facebook's going to try
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.680]   to get into this newsletter game.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.720]   Facebook is starting audio only stuff that we're about to hear about this week.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.120]   And I think a lot of us who are coming up now, we know, you know, that is a bargain.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.480]   That's one with the devil.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.940]   And you know, it might give you some better results short term, but if you want to be
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.420]   successful in the long term, stay away, build it sustainably, and so that it doesn't end
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.440]   up collapsing on you sometime in the future.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   It's been, you know, it's funny because in rich, you probably, more than anybody who's
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.920]   been through all this, I started in broadcast media like you.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.720]   And broadcast media has been very good to me as it has been to you.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.800]   But at some point you kind of want to spread your wings in radio in particular has been
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.940]   faltering over the last 10 years.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.940]   I can't tell you how many radio guys I've worked with who said, how did you do this
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.940]   twit thing?
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940]   Tell me what you do.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   How do I become a podcaster?
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.860]   Because you know, radios is starting to get a little shaky.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.580]   People are leaving their jobs or their jobs more likely are leaving them.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.820]   There have been lots of layoffs in the last couple of years.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.420]   And so I think it makes sense.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.780]   If you want to be a content creator owning your own stuff in the long run, just makes
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.780]   sense.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.760]   When I started this in 2005 and 2006, podcasting was an infancy.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.840]   And now I think it's mature, it's very mature.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.080]   And we're starting to see podcasting become big media with Spotify and iHeart and others
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.840]   kind of dominating podcasting platform.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:59.360]   And unfortunately, you know, one of the reasons Spotify can give Alex, Joe Rogan, a hundred
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.800]   million dollars is because they can say, well, you're going to be exclusive on our platform,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.520]   which means people have to listen to what was traditionally a podcast or on YouTube and
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.680]   open have to listen to it on Spotify, which means they can track people.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.280]   And that's become hard for us because it's hard to sell against, you know, advertiser
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   as a choice between buying us and getting enthusiasts and geeks, but they don't know
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.460]   anything about them or going to Spotify where they not only know everything about them down
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.260]   to their credit card, never even know what part of the shows they didn't didn't listen
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   to.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.980]   And I don't want to get in that game with Spotify.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.460]   That's a tough game to buy.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.620]   Yeah, I mean, I've just been watching this very closely and I find it fascinating.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:45.700]   I mean, the, you know, I've worked for a media company all my life and, you know, it's really,
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.340]   I talk about this all the time, my wife, how when I started, it's like the only way to
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.420]   reach someone was to go through that conduit, you know, that channel, that radio station,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.420]   whatever.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.340]   And in my career, I've seen over and over every single way that we used to reach people, you
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.940]   can now do on your own without someone.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.460]   And I'm not saying that, you know, I'm ready to jump off or do anything like that, but it's
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.140]   just, it's fascinating that we never had that opportunity as journalists to go direct to
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   the people.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.580]   Now, here's what I think is happening.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.780]   And I think it's amazing that people can support their, you know, the creators they love
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.140]   and the networks that they love.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.860]   But I think we're seeing this subscription that we've heard of the term subscription fatigue.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.780]   And so that worries the world that worries me a little bit.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.260]   But I think here's what's going to happen, Leo.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.780]   I think someone's going to some smart aggregators going to come along and say you pay us, you
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.340]   know, whatever, 10 bucks a month and you get to pick five subscriptions.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.060]   Now, I know that sounds anti to everything we're seeing happening, but if someone's sitting
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.860]   there going, hmm, I add up all these things and it's 30 bucks a month, but I can get 25
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.620]   through this aggregator and then people will sign on, you know, it's just, I feel like
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.860]   that is probably going to happen.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.180]   We're going to come back full circle to like the cable model where it's like all these
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.900]   channels and you say, okay, but it's going to be much more flexible where you can pick
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.860]   and choose every month or, you know, six months, whatever.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   I don't know.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.580]   I just feel like there's something, you know, because I love supporting like seven bucks
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.580]   a month is great.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.460]   You know, it's like it doesn't sound like that much for something you love.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.380]   But you know, I'm sitting here with all the things I have $107 a month.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   Things that start to end.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380]   Right.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.220]   And right now we all have that limit of like that, whatever we are paying for cable, right?
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.260]   Like maybe $200 or like, okay, if I'm over that, I'm too much.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.940]   But as long as I'm under that, I'm okay.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.220]   So there's like this weird, you know, mental, I don't know, line in your head.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.900]   I don't know, but I find it fascinating.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900]   I love what's going on.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.940]   I do worry about that.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.660]   You know, that's, you know, that's, that's absolutely the case.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.940]   Although I have to say we're getting, I think we're getting a little bit more used to it
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.300]   because everybody's got Netflix and Amazon Prime and, and, you know, I mean, just starts
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.660]   to add up and I think we're just going to get used to it.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   But I don't know.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:59.940]   Well, this is what Apple, Apple tried, has tried to do this with magazines and newspapers
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.260]   with Apple News Plus, is that what they call it?
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.380]   And, and I don't know how successful they've been.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.380]   I don't think the newspapers and magazines like it very much.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.420]   The only ones that, that like it are ones that don't have a big subscriber base or a
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   national audience.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.140]   So they like the exposure.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.500]   But I don't think it's worked well for the good times in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.020]   And that's exactly where this, and that's exactly where this plays out here.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:33.340]   Those who already have a good solid base either because they're a, you know, they're somebody
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:40.460]   who has a brand that's, that's instantly monetizable and sub-stack or people who have
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.500]   a brand that accrues to them through the media outlet that they're with.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.380]   You know, those people are going to be okay and they're going to be independent, but a
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.940]   whole bunch of other people who are in that second and third tier are probably going to
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:03.820]   see some advantage to saying, look, I would rather get $2 each from somebody aggregating
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   me into some kind.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.500]   And try and convince people to pay me $5, $7 or $10 a month and know that I'm not going
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.500]   to make the cut.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.260]   I'm not going to make their, their, you know, whatever their threshold is.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.740]   What they don't like is that they don't get the, add the email address.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.020]   They don't get the information about the customer.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.580]   That's what customers like.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.980]   That's what Apple likes.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.780]   They hold that, but the newspapers don't get that and they want to build a, they would
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.700]   love to build a relationship with their subscribers.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.940]   And that's what the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have done so very well.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.940]   That's why they're so successful.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.020]   And this is by the, just to jump in quickly, this is the key part to like asking whether
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.420]   some of these writers, independent podcasters are going to want to go in a bubble, in a bundle.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.340]   You know, because they are at the end of the day, independent minded, they don't want
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.860]   to be working right under the auspices of a publication.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.220]   They want that direct relationship with the readers.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.140]   And if they're only getting two or three dollars from a bundle, you know, per subscriber, they're
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.700]   going to, you know, probably attribute more to themselves than to the being part of the
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.340]   bundle.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.260]   And by the way, people subscribing to a bundle of sub-stack writers, they're probably better
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.860]   off subscribing to a publication anyway.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.020]   So I think that like, you know, and a lot of these news publications are learning their
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.140]   lesson in terms of playing ball with Apple on this bundle with the Apple News Plus.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.500]   So, you know, I'm definitely, you know, I talked to people about joining a bundle of
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.500]   sub-stack writers.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.300]   Honestly, it's just more fun doing it on my own right now.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.860]   And I think that's going to be what happens by and large is that sub-stack writers are
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.340]   going to stay independent.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.340]   It was scary.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.340]   But it can't.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.620]   A scary move for you, though, wasn't it?
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.740]   I actually felt that I had, you know, no other option.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.380]   It was the timing was wild.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.420]   My book came out in April 2020.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.340]   And I wanted to keep writing on the topics in the book, but I wasn't going to have a
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.380]   chance to do that as a staff reporter and said, you know, let's just make the plunge.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.460]   And I had a relationship with people, you know, on a newsletter I was writing for BuzzFeed
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.460]   anyway.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.540]   And they all came over with their email addresses to the new thing.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.020]   And I don't know, I personally have high risk tolerance.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.420]   So I was just like, let's just go jump off.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   That's why.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.420]   And see what happens.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.340]   Do you feel like it's, you know, exciting to kind of, you know, what you do on a daily
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.340]   basis directly.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:28.260]   I mean, you can see when you get the subscribers and you get the paid subscribers, especially
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.420]   like you feel that.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.180]   I mean, that's got to come with an energy that you probably never had before working
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   for someone else.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.180]   No doubt.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.180]   I mean, to like this, you have to like being an entrepreneur.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.820]   So I'm not only doing the writing and I get to assign myself the stories and book the guests
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.460]   for the big technology podcast, but I'm doing the business deals too, or I have a sales
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.260]   guy working with me now on advertising.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.020]   And we're going to say a little bit more about that this week.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.460]   But like getting a chance to steer the entire ship is something that was always exciting
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.100]   to me as a prospect and, you know, not getting a chance to do that.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.100]   Definitely is super fulfilling to me and something that I was always hoping to do.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.740]   And it's nice to be able to, you know, live that out.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.740]   We try when we first started to it, I thought, Oh, no advertisers will just have a tip jar.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   That didn't work so well.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.620]   Cause there was no infrastructure around it.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.900]   That's the other things changed dramatically, things like sub stack.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.860]   We're using member full, which is a Patreon company.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:26.060]   I mean, Jack is really, a page round has been huge for people.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.980]   And now of course there's only fans.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   There's sub stack.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.980]   There's medium.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.860]   There's a lot of ways to go.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.260]   Is this another announcement, Leo?
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.860]   I am starting my only fans channel.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.100]   Now the big news.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.300]   That's the real news.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   Okay.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.980]   You ought to see the last race that I just bought.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.500]   No, you don't want to see that.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   Don't worry.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   I'm not doing it.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.260]   I think that that's another interesting side to this is that as a content, so they have
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.300]   this thing on Facebook called stars.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.940]   And I don't know if anyone has seen these or used them, but it showed up on my account
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.660]   one day and it's like people can leave you stars.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.860]   So when you do something interesting, people can leave like, I don't know, a couple of
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.820]   stars like a penny or two.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.460]   And so you buy them in bulk, you know, you can buy like $20 worth of stars and leave
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.380]   them for people.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.860]   And so I think that that's another part of this whole situation that has not really,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.100]   you know, in the past in the web, they talked about it back in the beginning where it was
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.260]   like, you would, you know, give people a penny for an article or something.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.700]   But I think that's another side of it is that.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.700]   The micropamest thing.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.700]   That was going to be the.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.700]   Exactly.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   That was going to be the savior.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.700]   It never happened.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   And it never happened.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.100]   But I think we can, I don't think the thought process was in place for that to happen or
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100]   the infrastructure.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.660]   But at this point, again, another smart person comes up with a way and, you know, maybe
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.180]   it's jacket, Patreon, but, you know, if someone comes up with a way where I just have a little
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.100]   bucket on my, you know, a Chrome extension with, you know, $25 loaded up and I read a
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.380]   good article and I go, dink.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.100]   And I just give someone, you know, a penny or two or whatever they're suggested, you
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.580]   know, brave doing is actually, isn't it?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.300]   Brave has those brave attention tokens.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.340]   It's a crypto currency, but they, because they had, it's a browser with an ad blocker.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.820]   They thought, well, if we could have some way of donating to the sites you visit that
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.580]   you're not seeing their ads, I don't know how well that's working.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.020]   But I think, I think it's an interesting experiment anyway.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.700]   And I think people want to support, we've come to the place where, since there are so
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.660]   many independents out there, we've got some place where we want to support that.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.180]   I mean, think about the tips you leave.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.340]   You know, you go to a coffee place and you tip the person, I'll block for handing you
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.340]   a coffee.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.340]   Especially now.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.580]   Because everybody's struggling a little bit.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.140]   So anyway, that's my news.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.540]   That's the, that's the story.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.620]   Thank you for putting up with that.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.220]   That's not the big news of the week.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.620]   Maybe the big news of the week is Apple's going to have an event on Tuesday, spring loaded.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.500]   And all the, all the Apple haters going, that's not the news, Leo, but I'm going to just start
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.500]   with that.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.300]   We'll just, well, because I think they've loaded implies, they're probably going to
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.460]   announce a lot of things.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.060]   We've thought for a long time that this would be the place where they would announce an
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.780]   iPad Pro, perhaps finally announced their long awaited air tags.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.620]   There's some evidence that that's actually going to finally happen.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.500]   But there's also, just a rumor came out today or yesterday that there are going to be multi-colored
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:18.380]   iMacs, redesigned iMacs on Tuesday as well.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.500]   Any thoughts about that?
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.420]   You, you covered, you wrote the book on the iPhone, Rich.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.220]   Are you, are you excited about Tuesday?
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.180]   I mean, look, I, you know, I cover tech news for a living and consumer tech news and Apple
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.500]   stuff always is the most popular no matter what.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.820]   You know, an iPad Pro to a consumer audience, a really tough sell, you know, you're not,
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.340]   it's not the sexiest thing in the world.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:46.300]   It's laptop priced, you know, you're, you're basically, you could buy a MacBook cheaper.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.140]   I think, I think the air tags have potential to be huge.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:55.020]   If those ever see the light of day, I think it's, it's odd that they announce the, the
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:02.100]   find my expansion last week with, you know, Chipolo, which makes little tags like tile.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.980]   So it's, you know, an Apple definitely makes products that other people, you know, they
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.420]   partner with Peloton forever.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.860]   And now all of a sudden they, you know, make their own Apple fitness plus.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.580]   So I think the air tags have potential to be huge for the average person.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.940]   The M1 chip are, are the iMacs going to have the M1 in them?
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.940]   Probably right.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.260]   Or M1X or, you know, we don't know, Apple's naming convention is, is weird.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.380]   The iPad Pro will finally catch up with the M1.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.980]   It will basically be an M1 in the iPad Pro, I think, an M1X.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.420]   You know, they could look at this.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   They're silicone.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   They control it completely.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.740]   They could do a new chip.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.900]   We haven't heard any rumors from the supply chain like TSMC who makes those chips, but
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.620]   who knows that what we do think or the rumor is, and it's a fairly well positioned rumor
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:55.940]   source that they will be a redesigned iMac, which, you know, it's probably a good idea.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:01.220]   The fine, my thing cracked me up because it was very, that's one of the reasons I think
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.380]   air tags is coming out.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:07.020]   It was framed clearly to say, look, tile, because tile's been bitching.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.420]   You know, we're going to open it up.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.780]   Tile notably did not join the, the, the crew of third parties.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.980]   Van MOOF bicycles and electric, actually, I love the name.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.460]   They're good electric bikes, but they're expensive.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   We'll have.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.900]   They have this little logo on locate with Apple Find My.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.180]   I never heard of Chipolo.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.260]   You'd heard of Chipolo before I never heard of that.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.260]   They were at C.S.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.180]   Many, many years ago and the big difference is, is that you can replace the battery, you
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.740]   know, tile the whole thing.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.740]   It dies.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.380]   After a year, you got to recycle it with them and get a new one, but Chipolo has like just
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.620]   that one of those, you know, standard batteries in it.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.980]   Is that, you know, like a flat battery.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.980]   I forget what they're called.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.780]   Like a, like a three, two hundred or.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780]   Right.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   Sure.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.740]   Um, starts shipping in June.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.660]   You'll have to get the Chipolo one spot.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.940]   What if you left your Chipolo and Chipotle?
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.940]   Would that be?
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.540]   No, I'm just, I'm just being stupid.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.980]   And then Belkin has a wireless ear, but I'm surprised it's just those three.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.140]   I would, Hey, if I made a gadget that's easy to lose or expensive, like a bike, I probably
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.300]   would want to put this in here.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.380]   And I love the idea of opening Find My and not only seeing my laptops, my phone, but also
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.220]   seeing other stuff that I can't find.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:31.700]   Apparently the person Apple's using for the demonstration of this lost everything in Golden
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.700]   Gate Park.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.140]   They got a backpack here.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   They got a bike there.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.580]   They got their headphones over here.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.980]   Clearly a little too much partying going.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.980]   Probably.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:47.780]   I think this, this Find My is so huge because it leverages every Apple product out there.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:53.060]   And also the one advantage Apple has also is this UWB chip, this ultra wide band chip,
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.620]   which lets you point your phone and get it as like a direction finder.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.540]   So if you lost your keys under the sofa, you can actually figure out that's where they
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   are.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.540]   That's huge.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.540]   Nobody does that.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.500]   And the fact that it's baked into the operating system versus tile was always a third party.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.340]   You know, I can't really ran in the background, but like with Apple, it probably didn't,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.780]   I don't know if it ran in the background, but it probably did not based on their architecture
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.780]   of iOS.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.620]   So the fact that this is running in the background all the time on every iPhone, you know, I don't
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.980]   know what the opt in process is like, but the reality is this has potential to be huge.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.940]   I mean, nothing may ever be lost again if you have one of these air tags on it or a
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.940]   chipolo.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.660]   You know, it's, I think it's pretty wild how, how wide ranging this could be.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.260]   I, we will be covering it. I'll be getting up early.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260]   Well, 10 a.m.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.260]   It's not that early.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.260]   I can't come early.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.260]   Early ish.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.060]   Well, Cam, it's supposed to be here at 11.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.060]   So it's a little early.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.300]   10 a.m. Monday or Tuesday Pacific.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.340]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.340]   Mike is sergeant and I will be covering the event and then we'll do Mac break weekly immediately
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.340]   after.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.500]   Ed, do you care?
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.060]   You don't, you don't use anything Apple.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.060]   Do you?
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.060]   Do you?
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.300]   No, I have an iPhone.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.460]   Oh, just in fact, just got two days ago.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.220]   Oh, 12 pro max.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   Nice, huh?
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.220]   Wow.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.220]   And yeah, very, very nice.
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.220]   Very nice.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.220]   Very, very nice device.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.060]   And I have a Mac book pro here.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.300]   Oh, I think of you as a Windows guy for some reason.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.140]   Well, I am, but in it's, you know, it's 2021.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:40.660]   You don't, nobody stays in one camp anymore except for some really hardcore Apple people
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:46.620]   who just buy everything Apple, you know, but, but if you, if you want, you know, I have
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.300]   Android devices here.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:56.500]   I have Windows devices, you know, car has car play and Android auto in it.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.980]   And I will, I love by the way, try them both.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.580]   You're one, but I have car play and Android auto, but I use car play, but it, I love that.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.860]   Then I don't have to use.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   It's funny.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.220]   I have a Ford Mach-E.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   And I guess because they have to, they include, you know, their own maps and their own stuff.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.700]   But who wants to use that?
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.300]   Don't you want to use the always updating phone stuff?
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.940]   See, isn't it?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.060]   Because here's the thing from a Tesla and they didn't, they use Tesla.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   The Tesla is terrible.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.060]   And it's terrible.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   And it's fine.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.260]   So it's like the best car in the world and it can't use the best system.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.260]   Right.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.260]   I know.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.260]   I don't understand.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.780]   So we just got, we, we just got a new car a couple of months ago.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:45.460]   We got a Volvo and I was in the same camp in our previous cars, which were Ford's, but
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:54.620]   the, the Volvo has its own app and its own mapping system that I think is, it is definitely
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.540]   superior to Apple maps.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.140]   And it is superior to Google Maps.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.300]   We just, basically there's a, on the screen, you can, you can just scribble in the name
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.780]   of the destination that you want.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.780]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.300]   With your finger, which is really nice.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.860]   Or you can use the app to find it, which, and then it will use Google Maps to locate
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.980]   it and it will send it to a car.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.980]   And then you can navigate it there.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.460]   And the, the killer feature for me is that it puts your current position and all your
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.820]   navigation instructions, both in the console, right in front of you, in between the speedometer
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.900]   and, you know, right, right there, and in the heads up display.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.900]   That's nice.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.140]   So, so, so yeah.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.900]   So I've found myself using the built in navigation there in preference.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   That's the only thing in CarPlay that I don't use anymore.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.820]   And we used to use Google Maps in CarPlay all the time, which was, you know, about as
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.660]   ecumenical as you can get.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.700]   Anyway, we'll, we'll see what happens on Tuesday.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.500]   I just thought I'd give you a little heads up on that.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.860]   Isn't it?
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.300]   By the way, I mean, I'm just thinking about the.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.780]   Apple products.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.780]   Yes.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   Line up.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   Yes.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.780]   And isn't it?
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.780]   I was like looking at what's going to happen in my eyes kind of glossed over like I'm curious
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.980]   for you guys to think because are you bored?
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.420]   Are you done with Apple?
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.620]   Not with this show, with the Apple products a little bit.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.300]   Because it's like, all right, what are the big announcements we're expecting?
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:34.060]   Maybe an iPad, you know, different colors on the MacBook and then a carbon copy of tile.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.700]   And it's interesting, you know, looking at Apple, a company that we used to like, you
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.740]   know, kind of count down the days to see their next big product reveal.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.260]   And this is what we're dealing with now.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.420]   And for me, like the more interesting stories about Apple are like, what's going on with
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.060]   the battles with their App Store?
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.060]   Right.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.660]   So what's going on with their fight with Fortnite and what's going to, you know, play out with
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   tile.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.100]   Well, we certainly talk about that too.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.020]   Like we're starting to move and maybe this is just me, but I feel like when the conversation
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.060]   about Apple is starting to move from look at the awesome power of these products to,
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.780]   you know, as this company wielding its power in a way that is detrimental to markets and
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.860]   detrimental to others.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.380]   And I just think it's marking a really interesting shift in terms of what's happening with Apple.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.580]   And I know it's not going to win me many friends to say that.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.580]   Well, they're playing it safe.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.580]   That's kind of my reaction.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.580]   I mean, we are for everybody.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.220]   We're at peak technology.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.340]   We haven't, I mean, you know, until the augmented reality glasses or whatever the next big thing
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.300]   is comes along.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.700]   That's normal that you've seen this ad several many times, right?
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.580]   You hit, you hit a plateau and there's no innovation for years.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.380]   I mean, that, that, that I expect.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.380]   Right.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.380]   They're in the, they're in the rent extraction phase.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380]   Yes.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.740]   That's what we had to put it.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.740]   Yes.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.700]   And there's a great deal of rent to be extracted here.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:04.980]   I mean, I think, and of course everyone has been waiting for, you know, the Apple self-driving
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.540]   car or whatever they do with a car.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.300]   But even there, I don't expect it to be magical and revolutionary.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.580]   But I mean, honestly, Apple, I mean, maybe you're a little jaded, Alex.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.820]   Apple, just the last announcement announced that they were abandoning Intel and creating
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.260]   their whole new chip architecture just for Mac and Tasha's.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.460]   That's a pretty powerful thing to say.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.860]   That's, that's, I mean, don't you think that's a significant announcement?
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.860]   No, that's a big deal.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.140]   And I won't discount that at all.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   Let's see what it looks like in production.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.300]   You know, I love it.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.580]   I already have an M1 Powerable.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.580]   People.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.580]   I was, yeah.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.580]   It's impressive.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.580]   It's in your computer.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.580]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.580]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.580]   Alex, let me get you one.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.580]   You got to see.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.580]   It's amazing.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.580]   The reviews were impressive.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.180]   Like the feedback has been, you know, across the board.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.900]   Like it was pretty impressive.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.740]   But, but I see what Alex is saying.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.820]   I mean, this is the thing about Apple is that, you know, they, they come in and, you know,
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.740]   for probably for many years, and this is why I talked about the architecture of iOS.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.260]   iOS, you know, is, is very secure and they love to talk about their security.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.680]   But, you know, the Apple does things their way and their, you know, services and things
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.820]   have a little bit more leeway on their operating system than other apps, right?
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.540]   So this whole fine my is going to be running 24/7 in the background of iOS where tile,
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.660]   I don't believe was ever allowed to do that.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:38.460]   And so just by that little tiny distinction, the Apple fine my system works and it works
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.460]   in a big way.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.860]   With a, with a, at a cost.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.580]   We're able to work because it's ecosystem walk in.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.900]   The ecosystem lock in.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.900]   That's the cost.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.900]   But it's not.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.460]   But if they're doing third party, it makes it seem like you're welcome into this, but
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.060]   we all know that that's a licensed thing that, you know, they're working with Belkin who
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.740]   is a, you know, obviously a very tight knit company with Apple.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.740]   How about this?
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.740]   And move.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.740]   I'm challenged.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   Alex has challenged me.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.140]   Now I'm going to give you another one, Alex.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.820]   Because one of the things we expect to hear on Tuesday is the introduction of iOS for
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.060]   14.5.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.860]   And you know, as somebody who's been writing about Facebook, that Facebook is terrified
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.900]   of what Apple is about to do.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:26.100]   For the first time ever, I mean, you, in an iPhone, when you install a new app, the app
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.420]   will have to tell you it's what, what permissions it wants.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.780]   And most specifically, we'll have to ask you for permission to track you.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.820]   Facebook's saying this is bad for small business.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.020]   It's bad for Facebook.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.660]   People are really worried about this.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.900]   I think this is only a company like Apple with the kind of ecosystem it has could say.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.300]   In fact, we're going to, we're going to screw all of you guys on a track.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   Our users.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   No.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.340]   Don't you think that's a big deal?
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.540]   I think that's a huge deal.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.380]   Well, I've actually have two minds about it.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.060]   So I actually do like the privacy stuff that Apple is introducing.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.460]   And Apple, you know, I wrote the book looking at the culture and leadership practices of
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.780]   the big five tech companies.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.940]   And without a doubt, the employees I spoke with, let me know that Apple is the one that
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.500]   takes user privacy, most seriously on the inside.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.300]   You know, Google, Facebook, relatively easy.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.660]   Or at least it has been relatively easy to get user data at Apple.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.580]   It's a huge pain in the butt.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.740]   So you know, I think that they're, they do walk the walk and talk the talk, but I wish
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.140]   they were a little bit more upfront about why they were talking to talk.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.140]   So why is Apple?
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:39.140]   So against Facebook, and of course, you know, maybe Tim Cook does have it in his heart that,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.900]   you know, Facebook is inherently unjust.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   It must be, you know, reined in, but he should also mention the fact that they're competing
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.980]   with them based off of product.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.180]   So you know, you talked about ecosystem, lock in, right?
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.020]   I message locks people into the iPhone and the Mac.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.020]   Yes.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.340]   Because they know if they were going to switch off, they become green bubbles in their group
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.340]   chats.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.340]   We're going to break.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.340]   Right.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.940]   Now when people start using Facebook's products, things like Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.700]   they become so much easier to switch off an iPhone, switch off a Mac because the most
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:12.260]   important thing you do with those phones is communicate with your friends and family.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.780]   And if you can do that just as easily on an Android as you can in the iPhone, not have
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.340]   to worry about coming up as a green mobile, not have to worry about breaking your group
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   chats.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340]   Then you can make that switch more easily.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.900]   And Apple knows this and Facebook knows this.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.220]   And only Facebook is willing to say that actually like, you know, they're competitors
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.580]   with Apple, whereas Apple is trying to play this as like we're taking the moral high ground
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.340]   by making you more aware of privacy while trying to kneecap their competitor.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.340]   Of course.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.100]   Then we can talk for hours about the fact that they're and they're generally that.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.780]   And Facebook's going after the next big operating system that Apple has its eyes on, which is
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.780]   virtual reality.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.420]   Facebook has a ton of people working on Oculus.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.180]   Apple is dilly dallying with AR, but we've heard about forever and we haven't seen anything.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.820]   So I think we need to just like have the context with it.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.340]   Yes, these privacy moves are big.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.820]   I welcome them as a consumer.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.460]   I want to have more privacy.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.420]   But I also want more honesty from Apple, you know, talking about what it's doing to solidify
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.460]   the power of its own ecosystem, the anti-competitive component of this as well.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.420]   And I don't expect us to hear that from Tim Cook anytime soon, because I think the media
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.460]   tends to give him a pretty big pass and say, look at this man.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.460]   He's standing up for the values we all believe in without looking one layer deeper.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.900]   So that's my hope.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   I agree with you.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.020]   And I mean, we talk about on MacBrick Weekly, Apple's position with China.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.940]   Apple tried to do its own ad platform and failed.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.540]   So they've embraced, you know, blocking, tracking.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.060]   And it's clearly, you know, it's a profit-making company.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.780]   This is a marketing thing.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.780]   We're for privacy.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.340]   Those other guys aren't.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.060]   But they're also walking the walk.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.060]   It's not just the talk.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:51.940]   I mean, I think they are making good moves in favor of privacy and whether they're doing
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.020]   it because they're altruistic.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.500]   I don't think any corporation is altruistic.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.620]   Your job is to make money and it's good business.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.620]   So it's good business.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.620]   It's good for us.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.220]   Oh, they're not going to say that.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.620]   It's not going to say that.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.820]   Nobody's going to ever say that.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:08.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.620]   You can at least add the proper context to it.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.820]   Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.580]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   Apple's a corporation.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.660]   You know, I think there are a lot of Apple fans going way back to the earliest days who
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.340]   you know, love the company and have this great, you know, there's a my team and it's
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.460]   the computer for the rest of us.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:33.140]   And I think differently, but everybody, if you think about it, knows you may love Apple,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.140]   but I love you.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.740]   They love your money.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.740]   That's right.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.620]   One nice thing about like what they're doing here is it shows us the power of the markets,
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.980]   functioning markets, right?
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   Providing.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.980]   Exactly.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.220]   If we want privacy, then Apple wins.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.220]   Apple people don't.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.700]   Wins by providing people something they ask for.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.620]   That's exactly right.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.320]   So I think that I will watch on Tuesday with what they announced, but you I can almost
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.060]   promise you get your bingo card ready.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.060]   Privacy will come up.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:03.860]   You know, even even Microsoft saying this and the last time such in Adele came on stage,
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:09.500]   he talked about trust and and sovereignty and things like that.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:16.840]   I mean, he really, he also realizes, you know, Microsoft succeeds to the degree that Facebook
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.540]   and Google fail and Amazon fail.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.460]   And so privacy is good for Microsoft.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.260]   It's good for Apple.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.280]   And it just maybe it's a side effect that it's good for the rest of us too.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   It's good for business.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   Let's put it down.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   We'll take it.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   We'll take it.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.480]   And let's be honest, it's been a it's been a privacy free for all for the internet for
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.800]   the past, you know, 20 years.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.280]   I mean, the, you know, these entire companies like YouTube and AdSense and everything that
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.440]   Google runs and Facebook and everyone.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.240]   I mean, it's all been based on our user information and Apple has kind of latched into that and
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   realize that, you know, they sell a lot of products that, you know, don't necessarily
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.500]   rely on our personal data and the stuff that does, you know, like Apple news and stuff
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.620]   they personalize on a device basis.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:04.540]   So they found a spot that they can really kind of burrow into and consumers like it because
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:09.100]   it is, you know, when I use an iPhone, I do feel like the stuff I do on there is not
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.460]   leaving into a million different trackers.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.940]   And, you know, whereas on Android, it definitely feels like it is.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:22.040]   And so I think that there's a lot of change in store for these big advertising companies
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.640]   and big tech companies because they have to kind of rethink the game because it's not
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.840]   just when you get that message that says, you know, I opened the Wall Street Journal
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.560]   the other day and I got the message that was like, Hey, can we track you across all of
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.920]   the websites you visit so that we can deliver you better ads?
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.680]   And what I say, I said, no, you got to be crazy to say yes to that.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.720]   I mean, who is going to say yes to that?
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:47.300]   Yeah, that happened with me and Venmo and I was like, Venmo, you want to track me across
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   all the websites?
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.940]   I thought I was just using you to do payments person in person, but it turns out that Venmo
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.460]   wants a whole lot more data.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:59.260]   So I know the big headline is Apple versus Facebook as it should be.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.380]   But I think one of the cool side effects of this is we're going to start to see, you
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.980]   know, how many apps are out there really tracking and have been tracking for a long
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.980]   time.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.260]   And by the way, they track on the iPhone.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:13.780]   So I think Apple is starting to now catch up to some of its rhetoric.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.640]   What happens on the iPhone stays on the iPhone.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.880]   Well, really, that's not really the case because they have the store that enables you
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.800]   to download apps to track you and go elsewhere.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.440]   So now their actions are starting to catch up with their marketing.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.760]   And I think that's good.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.560]   Apple apparently has some sort of a flock style segment thing it does with audiences too.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.160]   Apple is not completely out of the tracking business, but it's poorly documented.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.360]   We're not really sure what it does.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:48.840]   And that's the downside of Apple being kind of, you know, so secretive and closed off and
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   proprietary.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.280]   We don't really know for a fact that Apple's not tracking us.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.120]   In fact, there's some evidence they are.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Well, okay.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.320]   And let me, this is, this is fascinating.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.840]   So, you know, when you look at something like the Apple Watch and where did I saw us?
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.880]   Anyway, it's one of these things where they know what you're looking at, what you're
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.640]   using on the watch, how you're using the watch, right?
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.000]   Like what apps you use the most, how, you know, even like a flow of like you go from
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.560]   your home screen to the stopwatch to a workout.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.400]   I mean, there's a lot that they do that like you wouldn't really think even though.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.840]   Okay, this is the best example.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.800]   If you have an iPhone and you have Siri suggestions on board, you know, like you have the widget
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.440]   with Siri, just put it on your home screen or put on a screen for a little bit.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.320]   And I'm not kidding because I dial the same two phone numbers every morning for KTLA
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.600]   to do, you know, to set up my live shot.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.040]   And so every morning, as soon as I put in my headphones, it says, oh, do you want to
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   dial this first number?
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   Because you always do.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   I always do.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.200]   Because I always do.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.800]   And then it says, as soon as I disconnect that call, it says, do you want to dial this
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   number?
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   I say, wow, of course.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.240]   And then it says, do you want to check your Facebook because that's what you typically
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   do after this.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.600]   So the fact is, you know, and this may not leave your phone.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.800]   Like Apple may argue that that just stays on your phone and that's Siri, you know, smarts.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.920]   But the reality is that it's a little window into just how much these companies know about
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.960]   what we're doing and the patterns and trends that they can extrapolate in a million different
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   ways.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.280]   And if it's a company like Facebook, they've, you know, they're doing it for real.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.840]   I guess as to whose benefit.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.040]   So Apple would say, well, we're doing this for you, Rich.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   We're not doing it for third party advertisers.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.680]   We're doing it for you.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.800]   So and we keep it to ourselves.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   So okay.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.840]   Remember, Google tried to do the same thing with the Google now and Google cards and it's
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   shut down.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   I'm not.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840]   And I thought, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.160]   It's going to know what I do.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   It's going to tell me ahead of time, you know, oh, don't forget do this.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   That's going to be useful.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   I love that idea.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   I think probably, yeah, people probably didn't like it because they were worried to go what
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.880]   Google was going to do with it.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.200]   So this is another reason Alex why Apple is going to double down on privacy is because
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.800]   they want to do these kinds of things.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.520]   But they know that if they're not very clear that they're going to keep it to themselves,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.760]   people aren't going to play along.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.920]   So there's definitely a big move.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.680]   I think my comment earlier about glossing over at their products, I think that stands
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.480]   because, you know, they're, they're, they're innovating at the margins.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.400]   And I know that they've just introduced these, this, you know, this important chip.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.880]   But I don't think making your computer faster changes your life.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.760]   And Apple, I mean, it's tough to expect a company to make life changing products over
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.520]   and over and over again.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.920]   But Apple has.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.120]   And yeah, I'm just wondering, you know, are these going to become kind of wrote or are
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:48.000]   we going to continue to start to see, you know, the sort of life changing type of invention
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.480]   coming out of that company?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   You know, we talk a lot about what's going to happen with Apple and AR, what's going
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   to happen with the Apple car.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   And you know, I don't know, maybe, maybe I'm expecting too much out of them, but, but
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.080]   I don't think so.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.760]   And that's why to me these, these new product releases are fairly run of the mill.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   Let's take a little break.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   I love it.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.160]   We got the, the anti big tech guy on the author big technology.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.640]   His sub stack is big technology that sub stack.com.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.280]   Alex Catrowitz, great to have you here.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.440]   Ed bot who's been uncharacteristically silent.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.720]   Had nothing to say at all about Apple.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.000]   It's always a pleasure to have you.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.840]   Ed bot report from ZD net.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.320]   And of course rich, tomorrow rich on tech.tv KTLA's.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.160]   Do they say that?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.440]   They still say that KTLA's rich tomorrow.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   Sure.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   KTLA is rich tomorrow.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   It's great to have all three of you.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:48.560]   More coming up in just a little bit, but first a word from IT pro TV, whether you run a business
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   or you're looking to get a job in it, you know, you got to stay up to date on the latest
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   trends.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.400]   I mean, this is a, this is one of the things we love about this is constantly changing
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.600]   area in it.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.800]   If you've got an IT team and you want them to be ready for any challenge, keep them up
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.960]   to date, keep their skills up to date from with IT pro TV.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.840]   Not only can you get your team the most recent certificates and training in IT, you can make
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.560]   sure they stay on track with content they enjoy watching.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.600]   It's not a chore to watch it pro TV.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.880]   They've got very smart, best trainers who are able to make it engaging and exciting
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   and interesting.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:33.080]   Their passion for the field is communicated and keeps you interested, keeps you passionate.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.800]   If you've got the team training portal, you're going to love this.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.040]   They call it the pro portal, you'll be able to track your team's results, prove the ROI
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.720]   of your training spend.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:47.240]   You can manage your seats, assign and unassign team members, access monthly usage reports.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.360]   You'll get metrics like logins, viewing time courses, your tracks completed and more.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.920]   Makes it very easy to manage your teams.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.160]   You can even create subsets of teams, giving everybody customized assignments, monitoring
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.760]   progress as a group, as an individual, reporting on the usage of the platform.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.640]   I love it because IT Pro TV has a ton of content.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.680]   They've got now amazing seven studios running all day Monday through Friday, creating the
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.880]   latest content because stuff's always changing.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.280]   What's great about the team platform is you can assign even just a little individual episode
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.600]   within a course as well as full courses.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.200]   If somebody needs to polish up a particular skill, you could say, "Hey, you should watch
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.040]   this."
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.840]   You can download the data in a CSV.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.480]   If you've got more advanced reporting needs, you can incorporate into that.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.200]   Immediate insight into your team's viewing patterns and progress over any period of time.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.560]   The ports, by the way, are visual.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.720]   They're easy to see, easy to read.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.880]   They're updated weekly, monthly and quarterly.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.760]   You can even get email alerts.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:54.800]   A great solution for anybody who wants to keep a team tip-top and connected.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.080]   Of course, any individual who wants to learn the skills you need to get that first job
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.760]   in IT, you get those certs, or you're already in IT and you just want to learn more stuff
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.200]   because it's so much fun.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.800]   This month is Linux month.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   Yay.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.280]   Two Linux related webinars.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.520]   They're just wrapping up that Linux free weekend.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.560]   It's not too late, though, April 17th and 18th.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.520]   By the way, those Linux related webinars will be there on demand as well.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.400]   If you've been checking out ITProTV's podcast, TechNata, with Don Pazette, they're celebrating
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.040]   their 200th episode, April 22nd.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.320]   Wow, that's exciting.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.200]   200th episode this week.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.800]   They'll be doing a live show and giveaways.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.360]   Learning IT, getting a certain IT, getting that team up to speed, there is no better place
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   than ITProTV.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.080]   Go to itpro.tv/twit.

[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.280]   Use the code Twit30 at checkout.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.920]   ITProTV.

[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.040]   started the company.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.400]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.320]   We've been out there to Gainesville, Lisa, and I see the facility.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.200]   Can you believe they have seven studios now?
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   Man.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Itpro.tv/twit.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:25.080]   Actually, we have been able to kind of peek behind the curtain at some apples.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.360]   A couple more Apple stories just real quickly.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.160]   One, Apple music has revealed how much they pay per stream.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:38.280]   This is really a shot against Spotify and the other streamers.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:47.960]   They said a letter that they pay a penny, a stream, which is about 10 times what some
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:54.120]   other streaming services pay, double what Spotify pays per stream.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.920]   Spotify pays an average about a third to a half penny per stream.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.960]   Of course, Spotify has got a bigger user base, so a hit on Spotify is going to generate
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.040]   a lot more streams.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.440]   But Apple wants musicians to think anyway.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   This is another one.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   This is marketing again.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   Exactly.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.240]   To think anyway that Apple loves them.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   Any thoughts?
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.280]   I've tailored Swift-Covere.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.360]   What would she say?
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:28.680]   I thought there are several good analyses of that that I read this week, but it's basically
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:35.480]   taking one set of numbers and comparing them to a completely different set of numbers.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.360]   I won't say apples and oranges, but you know, the e-s.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.760]   And Spotify has free plays.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.280]   Apple doesn't.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.640]   For example, and just a much huger base.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:52:01.880]   Apple is completely non-transparent about the way that it compensates artists.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:10.000]   It mushed together the payments that it makes to labels and artists there, but then the
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.920]   compliant press picked it up and just interpreted that as all this money going to artists.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:22.200]   If you talk to artists, they will tell you that no, they don't get all that money.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:36.440]   The whole thing struck me as one of the less-seamly examples of Apple PR trying to distort its
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.960]   competitive position.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:43.880]   It made me clench my teeth.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.320]   Variety's headline, "Why it's misleading to say Apple Music pays twice as much per stream
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.840]   as Spotify."
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.320]   Was that letter for artists or was it the Apple hope it would leak and get picked up by the
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.360]   Wall Street Journal as it did?
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.920]   In other words, who are they trying to snow?
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.320]   There's no question that they, in fact, I don't think they hoped that it would leak.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   It was probably leaked.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.400]   It probably managed the leak.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:19.720]   There is nothing, if something leaks from Apple and it's not supposed to leak from Apple,
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:25.000]   then you have lawsuits and stuff, but stuff leaks from Apple all the time.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.680]   This has all the hallmarks of a deliberate leak with PR intent behind it.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.040]   A plant, not a leak.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.120]   The journal has often been complicit in this.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.320]   Let's not forget the war between Spotify and Apple.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.880]   That's another Alex talking about it.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.680]   Why is Spotify the most popular music service in the world not on the Apple Watch?
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.120]   It makes zero sense.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   The Apple Watch has been out for five years.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:02.680]   There's no way that Spotify can't come up with an app that works on the watch.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.880]   There's a lot going on here.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.080]   There just is.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.560]   It's more than meets the eye and little stories like this make people feel good about Apple.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.800]   I'm sure they probably do pay a little bit more.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   Who knows?
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.160]   The reality is there's many more moving parts.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.400]   I'm sure every artist out there would rather have Spotify on people's wrists right now
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.480]   than two cents from a stream on Apple Music.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.120]   You can't set Spotify as the default on Syria, at least you haven't been able to for a long
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   time.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   Why is that?
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.240]   It's not because Apple customers don't like Spotify.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.400]   We did finally get defaults for browsers and mail.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.280]   I can't believe it.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.200]   I never thought I would see that in my lifetime, which is funny because if you think about
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.720]   every computer in the world, you're able to set your defaults even on Android forever.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.680]   Apple Maps still, if you have an Apple Watch or any sort of voice command is still going
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.120]   to go to Apple Maps.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.760]   Music is still right now.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:08.160]   You could say play something on Spotify, but nobody does that.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:14.200]   It's tough enough to learn these commands and then to verify whatever, to explain them
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.040]   even further is even tougher.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   Well, all right.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.200]   Let's spread the hate a little bit.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   Google.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.320]   Next victim.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.840]   Next victim.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:31.560]   Google has once again utilized the double Irish and moved $75 billion.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.360]   Actually, they did it in 2019, but we're just now learning.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:43.320]   We've $75 billion in profits through Ireland using the traditional double Irish.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.480]   Does this have the Bermuda reach around in this one?
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   I don't know.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.920]   But in other words, avoiding tax by offshoring profits is a long standing thing.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.520]   I thought you couldn't do that anymore.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.680]   Is that still legal?
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.560]   They did in 2019.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.560]   Oh, they did.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.600]   Oh, they did use the Bermuda reach around.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.560]   It's okay.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.280]   So, it does sound bad.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.880]   I think I've made that up.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.720]   There was the double Irish, the double Dutch.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.800]   They apparently, the company, Google Ireland Holdings, is registered in Ireland before the
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.720]   purposes of paying tax domiciled in Bermuda.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.080]   Man, you know, look, it's obviously legal.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.000]   They wouldn't do it.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.880]   You know, if you confront these guys with it, they said, "Well, we're just doing what
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.680]   the law allows us.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.000]   You should talk to Congress."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.040]   But of course, Congress writes the laws because Google tells them to.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.760]   So anyway, I thought I'd spread the hate.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   Little extra.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.160]   Just going around.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.680]   You know, that logic to go speak to Congress to me just gets me every time because you're
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.840]   rightly there are a lot of different influence campaigns, whether it's lobby money.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.080]   You know, these companies fund like every think tank out in Washington.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.560]   I mean, maybe not everyone, but.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.720]   Well, in many of these laws are written by lobbyists.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.560]   Literally written by lobbyists.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.360]   And so it's like, well, we can't ask Congress.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.520]   And by the way, that's why people feel like the system is rigged against them.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.680]   You know, you have a common person paying a ton of taxes.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.920]   And then you have these big companies paying lobbyists, paying think tanks.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.000]   They influence what's written.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.200]   And they write the laws, then they don't pay taxes.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.720]   And then they just throw their hands up and they say, "It's the system.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   It's the system."
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.320]   And then you wonder why people want to bring the system down.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.600]   Australia continues its attack on Google.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says that Google broke the law.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.240]   They've been found to have, quote, "partially misled Australian consumers about collecting
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   location data."
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.720]   It's actually was a federal court ruling handed down in an action brought by the Consumer
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.040]   Rights Watchdog.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:15.000]   It turns out when you turn off location history on some Android and Pixel phones, the location
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.520]   history is still being collected.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:22.760]   You have to turn off location history and web and app activity.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:27.640]   So Google continued to collect location data if web and app activity was on.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:33.880]   And the justice said this was partially misleading.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.960]   Not sure if there will be a consequence to Google.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:46.480]   But I mean, I think this is giving me deja vu to a, I think, a conversation that we had
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:54.920]   and you and I had probably six or seven years ago now on this exact same topic.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:59:02.480]   And you were saying something then that you said just a few minutes ago, which is that
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.960]   why should I object to this?
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.240]   Because I want Google to make my life better.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.960]   I want Google to keep track of this stuff.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.920]   I need vocation on.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:22.240]   And my argument was there that you and I come from a position of fairly extreme privilege
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.760]   in all of this.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:32.280]   And the fact that all of this data is being collected and assembled into not just dossiers
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:40.080]   but the raw material for dossiers that can be built on the fly at any time.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.840]   And it just has the potential to impact all kinds of people who don't have the kind of
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.120]   privilege that we do.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.960]   So things like redlining, things like credit decisions, things like, you know, you walked
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:59.080]   into this store, you know, and this store is a payday loan shop.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.680]   Boom, you can't get a loan anymore.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.080]   And that's in your location history.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.840]   And it doesn't matter that you walked in there because--
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.840]   Does that actually happen?
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.680]   Or is that a perspective harm?
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:21.360]   Well, there's no-- all of this stuff is so poorly documented.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   But there is--
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.280]   We just don't know, in other words.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.760]   There has in fact been evidence of decisions like this being made.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:34.200]   And you can guarantee that every credit agency in the world would do this if they could.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.240]   It's not just credit, but insurance companies, let's say that Google knows when you're speeding.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.800]   I mean, let's be honest, they see your location changing and their algorithm could figure
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.880]   out exactly how fast you're going.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.600]   And I'm not saying they're doing that, but if they wanted to, that's something they could
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.960]   easily do.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.560]   And let's say they sold that money to insurance companies.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.280]   And then they cross-referenced it against the people they insure.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.640]   And they say, Rich, we've noticed that you like to go 90 in a 70.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.320]   And so we're going to raise your rates.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.240]   And I say, I didn't know my phone was doing this.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.880]   And it's just the reality of like, we don't know what's happening here with this data.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.060]   And we don't know until we do know.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.640]   And I think that's the scary part is that like what Ed was saying with these, you know,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.000]   the stores you go to, there's a startup out there that's going to say, oh, we can figure
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.600]   out someone's credit profile based on where they shop.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.560]   They go to a liquor store every day or a target or a, you know, Home Depot.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.000]   We can figure out what kind of credit profile they have based on that in our smart algorithms.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   And so-
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   Or dollar general.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   What happened?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.560]   For example, you know, what's that?
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:48.240]   Or dollar general, for example, you know, which you can take, you can segment retail
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   behavior.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.000]   But we've been able to do that for years.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.400]   I mean, I remember 30 years ago a guy coming in saying, well, tell me your zip code.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.440]   I could tell you what magazines you subscribe to.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.120]   I mean, that always has happened, right?
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.120]   And it was horrible.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   It didn't work very well.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   It didn't work very well.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120]   It was literally the basis of redlining.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   That was literally the basis of redlining.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   Oh, it was horrible.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   Well, yeah.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.120]   So what do we want to do?
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.040]   What's the solution to this?
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.400]   And maybe, I mean, that's why Apple's saying, hey, look, we may give you that we may keep
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.000]   track of what phone calls Rich tomorrow makes every morning, but we don't tell anybody.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.040]   Would you be willing to use a solution like that?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.920]   Ed, you got an iPhone, I guess you are.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.640]   You know, probably, certainly.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.080]   But even though we really don't know what Apple shares.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   It's right.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:43.260]   And the answer is not to come up with more rules and more regulation.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.360]   It's to come up with more transparency.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   I agree.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   I agree.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   I agree.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.000]   The thing Apple, by putting all this emphasis on privacy, we're letting them write the rules,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.880]   you know, and all these companies that, you know, is there anything really?
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.640]   That's, you know, Europe was pretty big about all the regulations with privacy.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:09.200]   But like in America, it's still pretty wide open to what is allowed and, you know, available
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   to people.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.080]   And I'm not saying, you know, like, look, these are just new companies that are doing
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.320]   this like the Googles of the world.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.880]   But Leo, to your point, yeah, this tracking has been going on forever.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.120]   Like, and I think Alex, someone said credit cards.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.600]   I mean, if you don't think that Chase is analyzing every single transaction that you
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.520]   make and creating a profile that they then sell your data against something else, and
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.400]   then that shows up as an ad somewhere.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.760]   I mean, this is all happening.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   I mean, it's all happening.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   This stuff.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   Welcome to America.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.000]   I mean, I think everybody wants you to, you know, see the animal society.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.840]   This is, this is the nature of your cards.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   I mean, those are tracking you.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.400]   If I had, if I had my brothers, everything would be open source and non proprietary, but
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.520]   that's not really a capitalist society.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.560]   This is the way stuff is.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.560]   I don't know what you want.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.080]   Government is somehow figure out a way to stop this.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.080]   I don't know.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.440]   Cause that's, that's given us that little cookie, cookie pop up on a website we go to.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.600]   So I don't know if I want that.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.960]   You know, I mean, that's when we talk about, we talk about the market though, like this
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.840]   is kind of, you know, I guess this is the moment in the conversation where I take back
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.200]   all the negative things I've said about Apple.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.520]   Leo, when you call me the anti-paintech guy, I mean, I'm anti.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.720]   The BS, but you know, some things that big tech do is good.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720]   We love big tech.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.520]   And that's where this is, this is really fundamentally what's driving everything I do.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.800]   I, is it a little, the admiration, a love and a fascination by technology with technology.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   Exactly.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.880]   And I think we need to like draw the distinction, like there are going to be companies.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.600]   We get to choose, you know, ultimately, you know, where we shop or what we buy.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   And their trade offs involved.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   What could look funny?
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.320]   For a company that doesn't track you.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.200]   No, of course, but like when it comes to devices, because we're talking about Google
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.760]   here, like ultimately it's a decision between, do you want to buy a device where you are
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.880]   the user and you are the customer, it's Apple, right?
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.840]   You use the products, you're the customer.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.680]   Or do you want to buy the device where you're the user and somebody else is the customer?
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.040]   And that's a Google device.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.480]   You know, you're using it, but the customer at the end of day for Google's advertisers,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.080]   not the people buying a phone or not the companies that are using the Android because Android's
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   open source.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.440]   It's not like Google's making a ton of money that way.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:23.120]   And I think that when we do engage with technology, when we buy devices, things like that, you
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.200]   know, this is a distinction that we should start drawing.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.160]   Maybe people already are, you know, am I going to be the user and the customer?
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.880]   Or am I going to be the user and somebody else will be the customer?
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.200]   In which case, they're buying me.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.600]   What do you guys think of flock?
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.920]   What do you let's start with you, Ed?
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   What do you think of flock?
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.400]   This is Google's Google saying, all right, we're going to turn off the third party tracking
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400]   cookie.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   We're going to stop tracking you.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.480]   Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to in browser, not off browser, but in
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.080]   your browser, we're going to look at all the places you visit.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.960]   And we're going to put you in a cohort, you know, old white men for me, I guess.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   I don't know, old white podcasters.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   I don't know.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960]   Howdy neighbor.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.760]   We don't really know yet what those cohorts are.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.720]   We don't know how big they are.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:10.360]   It's all kind of a work in progress or Google's being obscure, probably a little bit of both.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:19.920]   Is this a Google's attempt is to give advertisers some information without specific tracking.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   There have been some complaints.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.080]   EFF says, well, it's just another data point that will allow companies to fingerprint you
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.480]   because, oh, and here's the other thing about flock, which is wild.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.880]   After Google analyzes your behavior, puts you in a segment, then a little bit of JavaScript,
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.440]   any site you go to can query, oh, what segment is this guy in?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.240]   So you're basically your browser.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.040]   And right now it's only Chrome because every other browser said, no way we're doing this.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.160]   None of the Chromium browsers edge or brave or anybody.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   Or Vivaldi.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.640]   Vivaldi, they're all taking that flock code out.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:00.240]   But Google, if you use Chrome, which is the like 90% browser, huge dominance, if you use
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.840]   Chrome, any site that asks Google will say, oh, yeah, this guy's segment 53B.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   Is that--?
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:18.760]   I mean, this strikes me as a lot of hand-waving from Google and also a way of dealing with
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:27.480]   basically trying to end up at a midpoint that is still economically advantageous to them
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:35.760]   in a way that if they lose all ability to track, then their economic model, their business
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.280]   model collapses.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   So this is their--.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   Does it though--.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280]   Does it though--.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   --their fallback position?
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   Can't they--?
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   I mean, honestly, does it?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.280]   So the number one way Google makes money.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.160]   I'm pretty sure, maybe Alex, you know better, but I'm pretty sure is in search and selling
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.640]   search terms.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.960]   So they have auction, the very successful technique, and there's maybe a little self-dealing
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   on that.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.400]   But they have an auction for keywords.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.320]   You buy the keyword.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.760]   And then when somebody searches for something and that keyword shows up, your ad shows up.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   That's the--.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.800]   I think by far the most profitable thing Google does.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.320]   And it doesn't involve tracking at all.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:19.720]   If I search for cargo pants and the gap has bought that keyword, I'm going to see that
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720]   now.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720]   That's not tracking me.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:25.520]   That's just responding to my search term.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.520]   Even if it's 60% of their--.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520]   They're willing to lose 40.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520]   They're still another--.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.360]   Another 12% of it is hardware and G Suite and stuff like that.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.120]   But they're still up in the 80% that's totally based on advertising.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:51.480]   And I do not believe that the marketplace for search advertising is completely keyword
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.320]   driven and that there's no other signals that are integrated into that.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.920]   That would make no sense of--.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920]   Of the way that Google--.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.920]   Of the way that Google operates.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.480]   But you could definitely segment that stuff.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.760]   But I think that let's take--.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.360]   Let's just kind of unpack this from Google side here.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   If you gave me a--.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.640]   Or from a consumer standpoint, which maybe are aligned.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.080]   If you gave me the option to be tracked one to one, right?
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.560]   So a marketer follows me around the web with a cookie and knows exactly what I do and can
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.360]   pretty easily de-identify me.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.440]   Because we know that this whole anonymous tracking thing is often a lie.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.480]   And instead, I'm placed in a cohort of a dozen or 20 people or something like that.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.240]   So they just tracked the group behavior on aggregate.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.880]   I'd be much more comfortable with the cohort.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.120]   And I don't know.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.240]   Maybe I'm an outlier here.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:51.440]   But I do think that most of the tracking that's done on the web doesn't really add up to all
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   that much.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.280]   I think it's generally made out to be more than we hear in the common discussion because
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.800]   ads on the web are still pretty terrible.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.400]   I don't know how often.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.760]   Facebook, the most egregious tracker of all.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.400]   I don't know how often I see an ad on inside Facebook where I say, "You know what?
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   This ad really gets me."
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   How do they know that?
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:14.040]   I don't use Facebook, but I will tell you Instagram ads work very, very well.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:20.240]   And as deals with the public on TV, I get emails every day.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.280]   I can tell you the products that are being advertised heavily in the tech world based
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.280]   on the amount of...
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   That's what people ask about.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Exactly.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.720]   And I'm talking these little photo sticks, like all these Wi-Fi extenders, like the exact
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.440]   brands, the exact apps.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.560]   I mean, it's pretty wild.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.640]   So the advertising and maybe Alex, that's the case.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   But that's...
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   Those are not...
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   Maybe it's not targeted.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   Those are not targeted.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.640]   Those are...
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   You know, I get...
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.480]   And their crap ads.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.440]   And I would prefer if I were being targeted, they would say, "Oh, well, you know what you're
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   doing.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.880]   You're going to do those crap ads."
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   Here have some fine non-crapp ads.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.360]   And I would say here's the thing, like in a perfect world, it works.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.120]   Because, you know, let's say you're interested in a company, right?
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.520]   You, you know, athletic wear.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.000]   I was looking up this morning, this, you know, athletic brand.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   And you know, I look at the website, I go, "Okay, cool.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.440]   50 bucks for a pair of shorts, whatever.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440]   Not going to buy."
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.920]   Now, all of a sudden, I'm scrolling Instagram and it says, "Hey, get your first pair of shorts
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   for 50% off."
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.560]   And I said, "Okay, cool."
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.880]   Now I think in that case, it does work.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.960]   And would I rather see that than some random ad for something?
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960]   Probably.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   So I think that this-
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.920]   The rich you just want to contract more.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.040]   I, you know, I don't know.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.640]   I'm kind of, I don't know.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.400]   I don't hate the tracking.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.960]   I think that there's, you know, I think there's a time and place for it.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.400]   And I think that, like you said, like these Facebook is the master marketer and still
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.680]   the ads I've always seen on there are terrible.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   So I don't know.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680]   But, but, but, am I wrong?
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.200]   It strikes me and maybe because Instagram is a sealed box, it's from Facebook, but I,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.160]   I suspect that the Instagram ads I see are directly connected to the Instagram people
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.760]   I follow and, and other behaviors on Instagram, but they're shockingly good.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.600]   Those clearly know me well.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.880]   And of course, one of the things they do on Instagram is, you know, they sell t-shirts
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.760]   that have your age, your town in the t-shirt, right?
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760]   You've seen those, right?
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760]   It's like-
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.160]   It's like, I love Petaluma.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.600]   I see ads that say, because I know that their, that ad is so highly targeted.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.920]   It's got my eight, you know, 64, eight, that old or something.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.040]   And, and, and that's like, by God, they know who I am.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.120]   But by the way, by the time you get into one of these cohorts, that whole situation is
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.960]   gone because they now are tracking you instead of one to one as a group of people.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.080]   So, you know, they wouldn't be like, I love Petaluma.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.320]   You know, they, you could end up being with a whole group of others.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320]   I have mixed feelings.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.320]   I love telephones.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   It'll be back to the future.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.640]   Or I love California, Texas, Florida, London, you know, Costa Rica.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.280]   Like 64, like just over the hill.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   Maybe one of these.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.880]   How do I get the Czech Republic cohort?
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.080]   That's what I want.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]   Exactly.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   Well, you're with one person and then all of a sudden the marketer.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.120]   Well, so which is where you can use that to target, but then back into conversions and
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.400]   decide which to double down on.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   Which is worse.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.720]   You prefer the cohort idea.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.000]   I mean, if you're a privacy advocate, the cohort sounds better.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.400]   If you'd like to get ads that know what you're doing and make you think that Facebook is
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.800]   listening to, you probably want to be tracked one to one.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.840]   I think it's a matter of personal preference here.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.280]   So, you know, I like the market deciding.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.720]   That's why I like Apple giving you the choice and says pop subs, says you want to be tracked?
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720]   And more and more you're seeing that.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.920]   I think one thing that's very clear is that consumers are voting with their feet.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.280]   They're saying we do not want to be tracked.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.840]   In fact, that's why these browsers are not going to do flocking.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.280]   I wonder if this is going to hurt Chrome's market share.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.600]   I mean, I think more and more normal people, the people who watch Rich on TV or listen
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.840]   to me on the radio, I think more and more normal people are aware of this and are responding
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840]   to it.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   No doubt.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.000]   But let's say you use one of those other browsers.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.800]   Do you then end up in a one to one or a group of cohort tracking situation?
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   Yeah, that's the point.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   So, you might end up being a Google network.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.680]   Yeah, you will vote with your feet.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.480]   I mean, honestly, if you're using Google product, you're never going to win on privacy
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   because it's Google.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   But at the end of the day, that would be their pitch.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   Let me take a little break.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.840]   I want to talk about Amazon Jeff Bezos' last letter as CEO says, "We have to do better."
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.160]   Oh, and by the way, Elon Musk beat Jeff Bezos in the space race on Friday with a big decision
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   from NASA.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.400]   We'll talk about that too.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.600]   Rachaude brought to you by Worldwide Technology and Cisco.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:51.400]   WWT has spent the last couple of decades building knowledge, building expertise to help enterprise
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.840]   companies do a better job with technology.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:01.320]   I think there's one area that you really need to know about WWT and that's security.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.520]   That has become job one for every company in the world.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.600]   WWT offers security solutions and services to protect your business.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.520]   You know, we know attackers are updating their strategy daily.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   Are you?
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.520]   Well, you can with the help of WWT.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.600]   They'll help you prepare for and combat the next gen threats.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.280]   This is a company with the vision, the services, the capabilities, the dedication to deliver
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.560]   the security controls and reduce the risks for your organization.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.240]   They work with a retail bank.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.560]   The retail bank really wanted to establish an infrastructure that could prevent and failing
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.920]   that survive a cyber security event, a catastrophic event like ransomware.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:48.960]   WWT helped them reduce system outages by 40% and gave them a cost savings of 48% through
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.920]   infrastructure automation.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.000]   Whether it's risk management, endpoint security, network security, identity and access management,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.160]   cloud security.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:03.960]   WWT has the expertise, the skills, the depth of knowledge to help your business.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:10.080]   See how both WWT and Cisco can protect your business assets and intellectual property with
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.200]   a holistic security approach.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.760]   Go to www.wt.com/twit to get started.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.880]   Let worldwide technology help you.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.880]   www.wt.com/twit.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.280]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.640]   WWT, make a new world happen.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.400]   www.wt.com/twit.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:41.240]   The Jeff Bezos retiring, stepping down as CEO is going to be the chairman of the board,
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.840]   but less focused on data, day operations.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:52.360]   He's handing over the reins to Andy Jassy.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:58.400]   This seems like the whole show has been about corporate spin and PR.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.840]   Maybe this is more of the same.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.040]   In the letter he says, "If you've read some of the news reports, you might think we don't
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.120]   care about our employees."
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.080]   We do.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.320]   But maybe we ought to do better.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.800]   He's coming off a victory.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:21.640]   Of course, the Alabama warehouses voted against the union.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.200]   Fairly substantially voted against the union.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   He says, "While voting results were lopsided in our direct relationship with employees
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.920]   is strong, it's clear to me we need a better vision for how we create value from employees
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:41.400]   of vision for their success."
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.200]   I'm sure Amazon will continue to fight unions.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.680]   On the other hand, there are things they can do to make it better to work at Amazon.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:56.920]   He said, "Our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots."
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.720]   That's not accurate.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720]   Remember the...
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.320]   Was it a book that said that if you didn't cry at your desk once a day at Amazon, you
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:10.560]   really weren't working hard enough?
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.240]   If any shareholders are concerned that Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.000]   work, that's his goal.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.240]   I'd like to loot our focus on Earth's most customer-centric company.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.520]   Let me set your mind at ease.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.760]   Think of it this way.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.720]   If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer e-commerce and Amazon Web Services
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:35.080]   and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.680]   I'm confident they will reinforce each other.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:47.840]   Spin or do you think he genuinely is being a little affected by all of the blowback and
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.120]   wants to do something and make it a better company?
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.360]   This is Jeff Bezos' last letter to shareholders as CEO.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.240]   He's thinking when he's writing this as legacy, legacy, legacy.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.120]   For him, he's reading the news.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:07.000]   He's seeing what happened with the high-profile Twitter battle that led employees to end up
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.960]   sharing photos of the bottles that they've peed in and letters telling them to stop pooping
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.920]   in bags with the press.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.920]   He's like, "Amazon is under fire for the way that it treats employees."
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.000]   It's on its way to becoming the biggest employer in the US.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.600]   It's added a million employees in under a decade.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.160]   It just keeps adding 100,000, 200,000 a year.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.040]   This is going to be Jeff Bezos' legacy because at the end of the day, he's going to be the
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.560]   person who's going to be responsible for the state of the American worker because the American
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.760]   worker is largely moving from places like the factory, which produce things to place places
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:48.680]   like the fulfillment center, which distributes things.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.400]   Bezos is going to continue to grow.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.440]   Amazon added 50 million prime members in the last year, up from 150 million.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   That's stunning.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   33% growth.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   First, Jeff Bezos.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.600]   We heard that number, by the way, 200 million prime subscribers.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.720]   I think Bezos is thinking when people look back at him, they're going to look back at
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.440]   the e-commerce company he built, but they'll also look at the broader transformation that
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.080]   he led in terms of the economy and the way that work is structured.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.640]   Of course, there were other factors that were involved there.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.080]   That's why I think we heard so much about the worker there.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.360]   I'll just Amazon care.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:26.920]   Actually, I think Amazon cares a lot more than we end up hearing in the press reports.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.400]   I don't think it's a miserable place for so many people to work.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.440]   It can be really tough.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.700]   I do think that the reality there is somewhere in between what we hear in some of the worst
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:43.640]   is not like everybody goes in and brings their bottle to work and piecing it twice a day.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:51.560]   There are good jobs at Amazon, but they definitely have room to improve.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.600]   Amazon was freaking out when people were talking about the way that their employees
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.360]   are treated.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.160]   There is some right to stick to indignation that they can have.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.680]   The United States politicians are the ones that signed trade deals like NAFTA and Incurge
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.340]   China to join the WTO, which ended up having us trade those production jobs with women
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.340]   jobs.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:18.380]   Amazon pays $15 minimum wage, where the federal government has a $7.25 minimum wage.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:24.260]   I see Amazon side a little bit when they're looking at these politicians from the US government
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.780]   saying, "You got to treat workers better."
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.540]   Amazon is like, "You're supposed to be looking after the workers."
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:34.860]   In America, of course, Amazon we talked about has lobbyists, but there have been decades
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.760]   where our politicians have had a chance to make the situation better and they've failed.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.440]   You can also make the case that voting down the union in Alabama was a vote of confidence
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.000]   from the workers saying, "We prefer Amazon management.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   We don't need the union."
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.600]   Yeah, I'd buy that more if Amazon didn't go through the painstaking union busting process
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:00.900]   that it did.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:06.500]   Compel people to go into education systems and start getting the post office to have this
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:12.220]   mailbox in that might have made some people think that they were going to read their ballots.
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.780]   That might be one thing.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.060]   If you really think that you can stand up based off of the merits, you don't need to
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.980]   bring the union busting firm in.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.100]   You obviously have a right to defend yourself against unionization if you don't want it.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.560]   But to just go through such effort and to be so against it.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.100]   I don't think this was entirely the workers standing up and saying, "We don't want a
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.100]   union."
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.360]   Obviously, Amazon had a role in it and Amazon's like, "This wasn't a victory for us.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.820]   It's what the workers wanted."
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.020]   But Amazon corporate was definitely a victory for them.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.020]   They had a side.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.020]   They picked a side.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.620]   They pushed it real hard.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.780]   Then we saw the impact of it.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:50.540]   It's an interesting goal to become Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to work.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.820]   A lot of this letter was talking about how we already are great.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:23:00.300]   I'm not sure exactly what he plans to do to make it the best employer and the safest
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.140]   place to work.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.820]   There's a couple of things here.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:14.340]   Number one, Bezos is doing what Bill Gates did 15 years ago.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.100]   Andrew Carnegie did before him.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:23.260]   Andrew Carnegie did back in several generations ago.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:30.060]   People were skeptical about Bill Gates walking away from a day-to-day role with Microsoft.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.660]   Yet, that's exactly what he did.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.620]   He became a philanthropist.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:39.380]   He has really become his primary focus there.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:45.860]   I guess like Andrew Carnegie, some of that was to renovate his reputation.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:51.420]   I think to a large extent, but there was also, I think people who know Bill will say that
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.420]   there was some genuine personal transformation that happened along the way.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:03.220]   I think the other thing about the whole union vote, there's two factors there that we really
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.900]   need to keep in mind.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:13.380]   One is that this vote took place in probably perhaps the worst possible place to have a
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.380]   union vote.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.260]   One of the reddest states in the country.
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:23.260]   One of the reddest states with one of the most powerful so-called right-to-work traditions.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:29.740]   I just get angry when I have to use the phrase right-to-work because it's the exact opposite
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.620]   of what it should be.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:39.100]   Right now, the United States is one of the most anti-union countries in the world.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:48.300]   Basically, Bezos is operating as the kinder, gentler face of what every corporation is
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.300]   doing.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.340]   They don't have to bust unions anymore.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.700]   The unions are in shambles.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:03.100]   They're in shards on the ground.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:11.540]   With an NLRB that isn't able to really influence the course of the election very much, this
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.940]   one seemed kind of preordained.
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:19.860]   It's a country that's anti-union.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:24.660]   It's a state that's aggressively read and anti-union.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.540]   I guess this didn't surprise me at all.
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.940]   For Bezos to come back and say, "Well, thank goodness that our employees love us so much.
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.740]   I don't think that's what it means."
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:40.580]   He quoted 94% of our employees say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.580]   work.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.300]   He says, "We want to make that 100%, but 94 is not bad."
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.100]   This is better than Wendy's.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:51.260]   Well, and it pays better than Wendy's, I might add, and pays better than Walmart, I might
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]   add.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.260]   There are plenty of-
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.380]   At the end of the day, the workers did vote.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.460]   They did get to vote.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   They got to vote.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.460]   I can't just count their choices even though Amazon influenced.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:08.180]   This is Jeff Bezos' farewell.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:16.020]   Do you think this is his attempt to leave on a high note and just kind of walk away,
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.660]   watch his hands of the whole thing?
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:22.460]   How well will Amazon do without Jeff Bezos at the helm?
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:30.460]   I think for whatever you don't like about him, you have to say strategically he's amazing.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.460]   Right?
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.020]   I mean, he's brilliant.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.020]   Or no.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.420]   I mean, the culture- Go ahead.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.300]   Alex, you first.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.500]   I would just say that the culture that he's built, when you start to look at it upfront,
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:47.860]   and of course there's an element of how workers are treated, I think could be better.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.820]   I think there's a different scene that the experience in the warehouse and the experience
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.300]   in the executive suite, right?
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.300]   Two different jobs.
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.300]   Two different jobs.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   Very different jobs.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:04.140]   No doubt, but there are some constants where both workers in the fulfillment centers and
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.140]   workers in the corporate offices can have their jobs automated away.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.420]   We'll have to adjust.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:15.740]   In fact, this past week on big technology podcast I had, one of the people who worked
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:21.620]   in Amazon's corporate offices, a woman named Elaine Kwan, who had her job automated away.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.740]   She was on the phone with Gucci and Versace, stocking the fulfillment centers.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.740]   And all of a sudden that was handed over to machine learning.
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:33.980]   So everybody inside that company needs to be able to adapt and embrace change.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.260]   And you look at most big companies and they just kind of make something and they stop.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:41.060]   Like this was the case with Microsoft for a long time, where they made Windows, they
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:44.420]   were the desktop operating system, and they stopped.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:48.180]   And only after we moved to mobile and the cloud did they actually have to catch up and
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.540]   they've done a good job, although they were pretty late to the game.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.980]   But you look at Amazon and they're always one step ahead of what's going on.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.380]   You know, bookstore, then selling everyone through a first party marketplace, to build
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:04.060]   a third party marketplace, logistics and fulfillment, voice computing, hardware manufacturing,
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:07.980]   with something like the Kindle, not to mention the fact that they are a grocer and Academy
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.260]   Award-winning movie studio, and now they're moving it to healthcare.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:15.620]   And you don't excel at all that stuff unless you're a culture, your leadership and your
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.980]   processes and internal technology are locked in.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:22.660]   And I don't think there's anybody on the planet right now that's done a better job at that
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.980]   than Bezos.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:27.700]   So I think the company will be able to survive and the big question is whether they're going
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:33.420]   to be able to keep that mentality that Bezos has instilled from his position at the top
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.420]   after he leaves.
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:39.380]   Jesse, of course, has shouted him as his technical advisor back in the day before he built AWS.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.900]   He's done a good job with AWS, built it into a massive business.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.060]   But you never quite know until the person at the top leaves.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:50.060]   And we know with Microsoft, Bill Gates left and they put Steve Ballmer in, who was just
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.260]   there to end up making money.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.980]   And they needed to make another leadership change to get back to their more inventive
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   ways.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   So that'll be a question with Amazon.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:04.100]   But I think Bezos' legacy as somebody who's been able to build a powerhouse company.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:08.060]   I don't think that's ever going to go into question in the long term.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:13.420]   Ed, do you think Amazon will do as well with Andy Jassy as Microsoft did with Steve Ballmer?
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:14.420]   Sure.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:28.140]   And Ballmer gets a bum wrap a lot because he cheerleader, extraordinary developers, developers.
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:29.460]   Developers developers, developers.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:33.340]   And he also made that he made two really bad bets.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.620]   He made a bet on advertising that didn't pan out and made a bet on mobile.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:45.580]   The kidding pan out, but they were both very sensible bets, logical and the fact that
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:50.420]   they didn't turn out had more to do with external market forces than anything else.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:57.620]   But he also in the background was building the cloud infrastructure that became Azure,
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:02.700]   that became the basis for Office 365 and then Microsoft 365.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:08.060]   And all of that stuff was with Satya Nadella, who was reporting directly to him, who was
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:12.220]   building all of that stuff under Ballmer's leadership.
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:18.300]   I think ultimately when you go back to it, what happened is that Microsoft as a company
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:27.140]   was built to do a specific thing, to grow, to find an area of technology and just grow
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.900]   it relentlessly.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:31.940]   And I think Amazon is the same thing.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:38.140]   It's a company that was built to squeeze margin out of everything, to become more efficient
[01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.940]   at everything.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:48.300]   And so everything that they've gotten into, that was an impressive list that Alex spooled
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.500]   out there.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:56.460]   And the defining characteristic of all of those things is that each one of them, they're
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:02.700]   extremely efficient and extremely market focused.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:06.380]   And that's the kind of company that they built, that's the kind of people they hired.
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:12.100]   So it's a juggernaut, it's just going to keep on moving.
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:20.300]   And if it falls apart, it will fall apart years from now, not in the next two or three
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:24.260]   years because that's not what happens to juggernauts.
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:29.260]   Jeff's given it some good DNA, I think.
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:32.420]   I think you're right that he's sorry, I think you're right that he's getting out at the
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.420]   right time though.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   Oh yeah.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.420]   Because you do have congressional investigation.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.300]   You see, he's looking into them.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.100]   You know, the Congress is going to pass new laws.
[01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:45.140]   Lena Kahn, who wrote about like how Amazon needs to have stricter antitrust regulation
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.420]   is now on her way to the FTC.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:51.460]   So you know, Bezos might have seen all that coming and said, you know what, now's a good
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.340]   time for me to think about space.
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.340]   How about space?
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.340]   Space sounds nice.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.260]   He also has the Washington Post.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.020]   He has a lot of other interests.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:04.660]   So what do you think, Rich?
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:09.380]   You know, I think that I was just kind of thinking what Ed just said about, you know,
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:13.260]   they squeezed efficiencies out of these, you know, various industries, like, you know,
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:16.900]   they're going into grocery right now and everything.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:22.020]   And but every tech company that comes along these days, that's their mission.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:27.180]   I mean, they're rewriting the book for just about everything that we do in this world.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.500]   And Amazon was early on that.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:33.780]   I mean, they started with the bookstore and they just continue to disrupt more and more.
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:37.420]   And I don't see that changing anytime soon.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:41.620]   When you look at, I've read a statistic, I don't know, last year or something where,
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.900]   you know, Amazon, you think that they're, you know, that you would think that they control
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:47.740]   everything when it comes to, you know, commerce.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:52.820]   And it's just a small fraction still when it comes to what they are able to sell online
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.860]   and how many people they reach.
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:33:00.660]   And so I, you know, even without Bezos on board, I think they're going to, that's probably
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:01.660]   the worst thing you could say.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.740]   Because I think he is on the board, but he's not at the helm.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.740]   He's the chairman.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.740]   No, he is.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.740]   He's the chairman of the board.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:13.660]   So I mean, I think this company was set up to disrupt and they will continue to do that.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:19.420]   But then again, every company that comes along nowadays is disrupting what we knew and love.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.700]   And so I don't know.
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.740]   I think that it's a company.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:26.820]   I'm just thinking about all the things that we've talked about so far.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:32.700]   It's in America right now, it's very conflicting because we love Apple, but we hate them.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.020]   We love Google, but we hate them.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.220]   This show is a love Amazon example of all that.
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:45.940]   Do you think it's the same people that love and hate or is it different parties, different
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:46.940]   I think it's both.
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:47.940]   I think it's both.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.300]   Like I sit there and I order from Amazon and I order something.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.300]   And I hate myself.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.300]   Yes.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.300]   And I, it's a $5 item.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.740]   And I say, I can't believe someone has to bring this to my house because, you know, it saves
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.100]   me $2.
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.860]   But then when I tweet that out, people say, well, look, you know, that truck is driving
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.620]   down your street no matter what, whether they stop your house.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.460]   Jeff actually was a lot of this in that letter.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   He talks about that.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:17.220]   In fact, it's, he makes a strong case for the value Amazon has added to the country and
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:18.700]   to secondarily the world.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.980]   One of the things Amazon has never been able to do is make itself a global power to the
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.980]   degree that it wanted to be.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:31.700]   It's still, while there's Amazon.ca and Amazon.Australia, it's still really an American company because
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.540]   Asia's got Alibaba and I don't think, I bet you that's one, he didn't talk about it,
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.700]   I bet you that's one area where Bezos felt like maybe he didn't succeed to the degree
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700]   he wanted to.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:46.060]   He talks about being the best company in the world, but it really isn't the world.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.060]   It's a smaller, smaller part of the world.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.060]   He says earth.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.700]   Earth, which is by the way, telling isn't it?
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.620]   Let's talk about Jeff's space ambitions.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.980]   We'll do that in just a second.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.220]   Ed bot is here from the Ed bot report on ZD net.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:03.820]   That's rich on tech.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.820]   Don't confuse it to.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.300]   I know they're both good looking fellas rich on tech.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:15.300]   TV, and of course, Alex Cantrowitz, who is the guy behind big technology, the book and
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.620]   now the newsletter bigtechnology.substack.com.
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.700]   There's a big technology podcast.
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:22.700]   That's right.
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:26.500]   Yeah, we podcast once a week every Wednesday, a new interview with tech insider or outside
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.500]   agitator.
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   That sounded interesting.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.300]   Yeah, I'm going to go back and listen to that interview with the Amazon.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.900]   Yeah, come on some time Leo.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:32.900]   Anytime.
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.700]   Just all you have to do is ask.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   Okay.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.700]   All right.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.460]   We brought to you by Hey, before we do that, let me show you the do we have the promo this
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.460]   week?
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:42.460]   We didn't have a promo last week.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:46.580]   So we've put together the highlights from the week that was watched.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.460]   I'm looking at the salute, the Vulcan salute.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.460]   There's something different.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:55.460]   What it is about that ring finger of yours after three and a half years of Lori being
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.780]   very patient.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.220]   We decided that we were going to make it official.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.460]   Oh, married man.
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:01.900]   Yeah, congratulations.
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:08.900]   Seriously, on to it.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:15.900]   To it news, Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of NVIDIA is going to talk about the areas
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.900]   NVIDIA is venturing into.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:24.900]   I think it's become pretty clear with NVIDIA's growth and not only gaming, but cryptocurrency
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:28.900]   mining, self-driving vehicles, machine learning.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.900]   This is a company on the move.
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:36.460]   It's a new company that stands to fix critical security vulnerabilities affecting some of
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:38.540]   its small business routers.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:41.700]   What does it tell its past customers to do?
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:48.700]   Replace them with new Cisco devices, you know, or perhaps it's time to consider changing
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.900]   brands.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:50.900]   All about Android.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:55.340]   There's a new heads up feature rolling out for a digital well-being that will detect
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:58.020]   when you are using your phone while walking around.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:03.340]   So notify you to either watch your steps, stay alert or look up.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:09.020]   And this will be aimed specifically at those who are walking distractively.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.020]   To it.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   Watch out.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:12.820]   You're about to step into a manhole.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.460]   What they left out of that, because we didn't want to tell anybody ahead of time, is that
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.180]   we also this week announced the club to it.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.980]   And we encourage you if you want to support to it and hear ad-free versions of our shows,
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.180]   go to a twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.340]   You can learn more.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:33.740]   You can have $7 a month for ad-free versions, a dedicated discord clubhouse, and the Twit+
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.980]   feed, which will have all sorts of stuff that really isn't good enough to put in the
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:40.420]   main shows.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.060]   The scraps.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.620]   Our show today brought to you, actually some of it's pretty fun.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:48.140]   Our show today is brought to you by Podium.
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.140]   Think about it.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:54.580]   You know, if you get a text message as you leave a drug store, a grocery store, an ice
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:59.220]   cream shop, or a dentist, you're going to be much more likely to see that than and respond
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:02.740]   to it than an email that you get days, months, weeks later.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.340]   That's what Podium does.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:08.540]   Podium is the messaging platform you can use to power your business.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:12.060]   It helps you reach your customers wherever they are.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.140]   Business messaging with Podium can be used to get reviews, collect payments, communicate,
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   capture leads.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.220]   And it all goes into one inbox.
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.220]   Your employees will like that.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.220]   It makes it very easy.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.860]   And even use their own phone's messaging system to respond.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:28.980]   Podium lets you adapt to changing customer expectations.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:35.460]   And I have to say, I would far rather communicate with a business via text than have to call
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.620]   them because that's easier for me.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:40.860]   98% of text messages will be opened.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:41.860]   Email 20%.
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:44.900]   That's really all you need to know.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.260]   In the 90s, your business needed an email address.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.060]   By the 2000s, you had to have a website.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.780]   Email media in the 2010s.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:56.100]   Well, in the 2020s, your business needs to be texting.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.180]   And Podium makes it easy.
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.260]   You can, with Podium reviews, for instance, easily text customers as they leave your store.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:04.460]   It happened to me the other day.
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:06.060]   I was at the dentist's.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.820]   As I left, they said, "Hey, leave us a review."
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:09.820]   That made a big difference.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.940]   That quick response, a click in the text, and boom, it's done.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:17.500]   Podium Web Chat on your website lets Web Chat visitors text for your team right from your
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.140]   home page.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:22.020]   You can use Podium Video Chat and meet customers directly.
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.820]   Get paid fast with Podium payments.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:28.220]   It all comes together in Podium Inbox, which keeps leads warm.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:32.020]   And it responds, it lets you respond to feedback all in one place.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:34.620]   It's easy to set up Podium.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:40.180]   You know, dentist's offices, my ice cream shop, they're always sending me Podium messages.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.340]   It's great.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.100]   It's a great way to stay in touch with your customers.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.060]   And you can be onboarded within 24 hours.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.740]   They've even got a full team in place who can help walk you through the process.
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:51.740]   Just some examples.
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:54.260]   America's Car Mart uses Podium.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:57.820]   They collected 21,000 leads through the Podium Web Chat.
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:02.180]   TJ, the guy in charge of digital experience there, said, "Before Podium, we had to contact
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:03.180]   us for him.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.260]   It might be days before anybody got back to that customer.
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:09.340]   Now our response time is minutes because you know what your employees like using text
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.460]   as much as the rest of us do, your customers do.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.940]   RPM Alamo increased business by 20%.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:17.500]   You've generated more revenue, says Tony.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:21.660]   He's the owner, decreased vacancy rates, and pull in more leads than we could have in
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.100]   multiple years.
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:26.260]   This is priceless.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:31.060]   Podium, this is how your customers want to communicate with you.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:34.340]   This is how you want to communicate with your customers.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:36.180]   It's a must have in the 20s.

[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.140]   Podium, P-O-D-I-U-M.com/trid.
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:52.620]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in Tech Friday late.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.460]   NASA, big announcement.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:02.100]   They're awarding a contract to build the Moonlander 2 SpaceX.
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:07.700]   Blue Origin had bided bided bided, had bided, had lost the bid.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:13.180]   In fact, I'm starting to ride pilot as our space stuff on the radio show.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:17.540]   They said, basically, NASA just didn't have the money to go with anybody else, so they
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.140]   went with a low bidder.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:29.900]   $2.9 billion to use SpaceX's Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the Moon.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.580]   NASA has a program, the SLS Orion program, which will take the astronauts into orbit.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:40.780]   They'll transfer over to the Starship and then fly to the Moon and land on the Moon probably
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.220]   2025.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:49.260]   NASA had accepted proposals from Dynetics, which is a Huntsville, Alabama defense contractor
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:56.460]   and Blue Origin, but SpaceX won the bidding.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.660]   This could be very interesting.
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.660]   Certainly good news for Elon Musk.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:05.780]   Bad news for Jeff Bezos, who has been moving a little bit more slowly with Blue Origin.
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:09.820]   SpaceX has been very aggressive with Starship.
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.260]   One of the things I love the most, John Uris, space fan.
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.260]   You'll probably love this.
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.020]   Starship is, there's no lunar lander.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.020]   Starship does.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.940]   We've watched it happen on Earth.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.580]   It turns around and lands on the Moon.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:31.380]   The whole thing, like out of a 1950s sci-fi movie, just lands on the Moon.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.380]   Any thoughts?
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.860]   Are you guys excited?
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.900]   Broad said, "Bassett, Richard Branson in all of this."
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:41.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.460]   What is it?
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.460]   Virgin space.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.460]   Virgin space.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:52.180]   They're lacked and the reason I know that is because they're down in Southern New Mexico.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.180]   That's their...
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:56.180]   They were not in the bidding for it.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:02.100]   Maybe he's going to do commercial trips where you go up a little bit in the atmosphere
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   and down.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.620]   Maybe they're just focused.
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:12.260]   This reminds me, the meme with the two Spider-men circling each other.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:16.140]   They can't tell which one is which.
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:24.460]   Watching Bezos and Musk taking each other on is like two billionaires with their billionaire
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:29.020]   space companies.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:37.060]   I don't really see much of a difference between them in terms of their public profile.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.060]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:45.300]   Yeah, but there is a big difference in the aggressiveness, I think, of Musk's SpaceX.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:49.460]   Elon is nothing if not aggressive.
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:50.820]   Sometimes too much so.
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:58.740]   There was a horrific Tesla crash in Houston this week.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.620]   I think there's a little bit of...
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:06.260]   Honestly, a little bit of blame to be assigned to Tesla on this.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:10.820]   Two passengers were killed in the crash.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:15.820]   They were using Tesla's quote, "full self-driving" features.
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:18.620]   One of them was in the back seat, the other was in the passenger seat.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:21.100]   They were not driving.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:25.740]   The car crashed into a tree, drove off the road, crashed into a tree, burst into flames
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:28.620]   and killed both drivers.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:34.380]   I think there's a little bit of blame, honestly, on Tesla on this because they really promote
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.660]   this full self-driving, but it isn't.
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.940]   But are they telling you to sit in the passenger seat?
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:40.940]   No, they've...
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:41.940]   No.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:42.940]   I do think the car...
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:45.340]   Of course, this is horrific.
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:47.340]   But I think the car should have...
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:52.180]   My car, if you get out of the passenger seat or if you're too light, it says the passenger
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.580]   airbag turns off or on.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:59.300]   So clearly you can detect with quite ease if someone's in that seat.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.580]   Why is this system working?
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   The only way...
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:07.980]   Tesla knows there's not a sensor in the driver's seat is when you torque the wheel a little
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:08.980]   bit.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.700]   And it is true that when self-driving is on, it periodically...
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.780]   If it doesn't feel your hands on the wheel, say, "torque the wheel."
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:21.580]   But I have to point out that General Motors or the Cadillac CT6 in their particular self-driving
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:25.340]   stuff Ford's going to do the same thing with, I think, they call it, "Blue Drive," something
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:26.340]   like that.
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:27.340]   Blue cruise.
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:30.180]   Blue cruise has a camera on the wheels.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.340]   And it's an infrared camera.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:34.340]   And it's checking not only to see that you're there, but that you're looking at the road.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:35.900]   It looks where your eyes are.
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.900]   And it's...
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.900]   And that your eyes are open.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.900]   Yes.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:41.900]   You're not sleeping.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.020]   You could keep your hands off the wheel, but as soon as you...
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:47.220]   Like I tested it with putting on sanitizer.
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:51.340]   And so as soon as I started making those motions with the hands, like doing something else,
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:54.660]   because when it said, "You've got to put your hands back on the wheel," but otherwise,
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:59.740]   I mean, their system is engineered to let you have your hands off the wheel comfortably.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.660]   But you do have to be paying attention, like you said, looking straight ahead.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:07.020]   So I don't understand why this Tesla that's so hyped up, it doesn't have something like
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:08.020]   that.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.260]   And I've seen little videos of people where they rig like a hand on the wheel that moves
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:14.300]   it every so often or some kind of pressure on the wheel.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.460]   So I don't really understand that.
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.820]   Part of the worldview, probably, right?
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.820]   Freedom.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:23.380]   You're not going to be babysat in a Tesla, but probably it sort of goes along the lines
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.460]   of Elon Musk's worldview as well.
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.460]   Yes, I don't.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.540]   But folks don't get in the backseat.
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.380]   I just read that it took four hours to put that fire on.
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:32.380]   Well, that's another problem.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.380]   And that actually...
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.340]   32,000 gallons of water.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:42.020]   But that's because traditional firefighting methods don't work on lithium-ion batteries
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.820]   because they generate their own oxygen.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:47.300]   So you can't smother a lithium-ion fire.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.900]   You need to have the right kinds of chemicals to put it out.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:53.780]   And obviously, in this case, the Houston fire department did not.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.060]   They tried to put it out with water, which didn't work.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.060]   Didn't work.
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.820]   So basically, the car burned itself out.
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:06.700]   And I suspect that's caused a death because if you look at the vehicle, there sure isn't
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:10.500]   much left to that.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.420]   They wanted to go for a drive just before they left.
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.380]   And we're talking about the vehicle's driverless features.
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:21.780]   I'm going to guess because you do have to torque the wheel that one guy got in the backseat
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:22.780]   dumb.
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:26.580]   And the other guy got in the passenger seat and was just torquing the wheel once in a
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   while.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.580]   But he wasn't driving the car.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:30.220]   59 and 69 years old.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:34.420]   I'm not sure which one was the driver.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.420]   But it's a tragedy.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:38.260]   I know that Teslas have a lot of cameras.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:42.220]   Are they recording what's happening?
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:43.620]   Not in the cabin, unfortunately.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.620]   Everywhere else.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620]   Okay.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.780]   Teslas will have a lot of telemetry from this crash.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.580]   They'll know exactly what speed, when the self-driving was invoked and all of that.
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.620]   They'll probably know why the car went off the road.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:00.740]   But that's not unusual because if the markings fade out, they were not on a highway.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.260]   They were on a side street.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:04.740]   But I think you're right, Leo.
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:13.580]   One of the things that you said, right up front here, the original sin in this case.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:21.980]   Is the fact that the marketing department at Tesla was able to brand this product as
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:23.980]   full self-driving.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:31.500]   And if you pay extra, you can get the beta of stuff, which is even more full self-driving.
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:40.140]   And for any other kind of product, Federal Trade Commission, if you label something in
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:48.660]   such a misleading way, they will hammer you down with a 20-pound sledge.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:52.940]   And that's really what needs to happen here because this is not full self-driving.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:56.580]   This is driver assist technology.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:59.980]   And it's very good driver assist technology.
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:06.260]   But the messaging that is coming across is just all wrong.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:11.260]   And it's guaranteed to lead to situations like this.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.260]   Well, we see it all the time.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:18.500]   There are TikTok videos of people in the backseat of their Tesla.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:19.500]   Just stop it.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.500]   Don't.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.060]   It's not a good idea.
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:24.060]   But isn't that what Tesla is promising?
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.060]   They call it full self-driving.
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.060]   It's not a level.
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.140]   And so I think that's the thing.
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.380]   It's like, you know, exactly.
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:31.380]   It's not the different level.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.340]   But if you're just a consumer that buys this.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.340]   You believe it.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.340]   Sure.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:37.740]   And there's also a level of you want to test it out.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:44.220]   And how far do you go to test it out thinking that this is faultless?
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:45.900]   I mean, you know.
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.220]   These guys were not daredevils.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:48.660]   They were my age.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.580]   They just thought they could do it.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.580]   And they thought, let's try it out.
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:52.580]   It'll be fun.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.340]   This is the theme of the show.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:56.340]   Truth and advertising, right?
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:00.100]   The companies are, you know, welcome to tell us about what they're doing.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:01.340]   But just be honest about it.
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:06.540]   And in this case, it costs lives.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:07.540]   Let's see.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.540]   A couple of other.
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.740]   Oh, I know what I want to talk about.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.060]   Facebook's oversight board.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:17.860]   You had a good article about it on your big technology newsletter.
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:22.820]   The oversight board has decided to defer the decision about Donald Trump.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:25.140]   It's one of the cases they've been working on.
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.500]   Of course, Facebook.
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.060]   What was it after January 6th or before January 6th banned?
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.060]   After.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.060]   After.
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:37.860]   They acted in an excess of courage.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:42.620]   They decided to ban Donald Trump after the insurrection in January 6th.
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.660]   But the Facebook's advisory board has taken that oversight board.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:46.660]   Has it taken that on?
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:52.460]   And we'll decide if that ban was justified on whether to reinstate the former president.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.260]   Is the board working, Alex?
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.260]   What do you think?
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:51:00.420]   Well, there's two sets of opinions on this, which is something I laid out in the newsletter.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:04.900]   On one hand, people say that this is really just a head fake, that the board can only
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:11.020]   review certain content moderation decisions, not the recommendation algorithms, not the
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.740]   group they can't take down groups.
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.660]   They can't review the fundamentals of the product.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:18.300]   So they're really just dealing with the periphery.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:22.460]   And Facebook is like making it seem like we have a say where we really don't.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:26.540]   The other side of it, whether the board makes a difference is people are like, well, what
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.220]   other choice do we have?
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.140]   What alternative is there?
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:34.660]   And so you can have Facebook make the decision, you can have the government make the decision,
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:37.460]   or you could have some form of public representation.
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:38.460]   Make the decision.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:41.820]   I personally think it's good to have the public make the decision in some way, even if it's
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.020]   limited.
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.260]   And this is a good start.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.900]   So I'm really curious to see what they ended up ruling.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:51.220]   I don't think we should say that like, okay, Facebook's washed its hands of all of its
[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:54.420]   problems, now that it has some third parties making a call like this.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.100]   But it is pretty significant that it's not Facebook itself making the decision of whether
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:00.980]   to ban Trump or not, and it is going to go to this board.
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:05.300]   And I'm really curious what happens if Trump actually does return to Facebook because then
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:09.340]   Facebook becomes the one platform that's going to have Trump on it.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:10.340]   He's not on Twitter.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:12.620]   I think he's been banned from YouTube too.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:18.900]   And how does that change the nature of Facebook if Facebook becomes Trump HQ while the others
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.980]   are not?
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.620]   And I'm pretty intrigued by what ends up happening over the next couple of weeks.
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:31.340]   And they deferred it a little bit, but I anticipate that this thing is going to come end of April
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.340]   early May.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.020]   And it'll be really fascinating to see the outcome.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:39.340]   They say they wanted to defer because they received 9,000 comments.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:45.900]   They asked for feedback and they wanted to read all 9,000 comments.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:47.100]   Never read the comments.
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.580]   Never read the comments.
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.700]   If there's one thing we've learned.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:58.700]   So Alex, I thought that was a great column.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:00.940]   And two things struck me about it.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:12.500]   Number one, that you had the same expert at commenting on both opposing sides of the question,
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:23.660]   which really struck me as identifying the core of how insurmountable this problem seems
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:24.660]   to be.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:29.060]   But the other thing is I thought you wrote something that just I wanted to see it bold
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.060]   faced.
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.060]   I wanted to see it leap out.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:35.140]   You said for years people have questioned whether one company should have all that power.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.580]   But Facebook has the power now.
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:43.980]   And that's kind of a theme of how we got to where we are in 2021.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:52.220]   Companies like Uber, companies like Facebook got here by finding a weakness in the market
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:59.660]   and the regulatory structure aggressively rolling over any kind of regulation that is
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:03.500]   there and then acquiring the power and saying, well, we have the power now.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:09.020]   You can't, we have to find a way to deal with this.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:15.860]   And the third option here is to say, Facebook, you're out of business or you're broken up.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:20.460]   You're broken into five different companies that do God knows what.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:26.660]   But the idea that, well, we have the power now and that's just a fate of complete seems
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:37.860]   like something that shouldn't be dismissed as if you got there through horrendous anti-competitive
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:47.700]   ways that basically trampled on what we see as societal norms that maybe it's worth revisiting
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:51.060]   the decisions of how we got there.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:56.620]   Well, if Facebook reinstates, Twitter doesn't have a process like this.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.620]   It's at all, right?
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:00.660]   I mean, no, Trump is not coming back to Twitter.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:01.900]   It's just not going back ever.
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.300]   There's no chance he's ever coming back.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:06.540]   He's more associated with Twitter than he is with Facebook.
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.540]   Right.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:08.540]   Right.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:09.540]   He's gone.
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:14.140]   And I have to say, I mean, just purely subjectively, life has been a little bit calmer with that
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.860]   the daily 40 or 50 tweets from Donald Trump.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:20.740]   But that's interesting.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:30.740]   Do you, so why couldn't Facebook just have the nerve, the spine to do what Twitter did
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:32.580]   and just say, we don't need an oversight board.
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:35.420]   We're just going to do it.
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:40.180]   Is Facebook's oversight board a better solution than Twitter just saying, we're just going
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:41.620]   to ban them forever?
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:42.620]   That's it.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.260]   Hey, I don't know.
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:47.820]   The more I think about this oversight board, the more I like it.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:53.500]   And I'm nervous to admit it in public because it's not a very popular stance.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:57.300]   But I generally think that we shouldn't have Facebook making these choices.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:59.380]   We shouldn't have the government making these choices.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:05.300]   Yes, Facebook is turning over a very narrow segment of its decisions to the public.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.460]   Yes, it handpicked all the first members of the board.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.900]   But a prestigious board.
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.100]   I mean, they're good people.
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.620]   They're not exactly well, okay, there's an argument that now Facebook can show these
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:19.300]   people to Congress and say, see, you can leave section 230 in place.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:21.020]   We have this all under control.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:25.140]   So okay, maybe there actually are making six figure salaries for 15 hours of work.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.020]   But isn't Mark Zuckerberg saying you should change?
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:29.260]   He said he testified.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:30.820]   You should change section 230.
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:31.820]   Yeah, I know.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:35.340]   But it's always like it said change to the little, you know, to turn a tiny dial to make
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:37.620]   it harder for the smaller companies and better for us.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.620]   Yeah, that's the change.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:41.060]   And don't like change the like core protections.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:45.940]   But I mean, ultimately, like we want, I think we want the public making these choices.
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:50.660]   And we don't want to make have a man like Zuckerberg who runs a company who's unaccountable,
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:53.940]   even to his own board, to be the final say on this.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:57.100]   And so why do we let Jack Dorky do that?
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.380]   Well, should he have a board?
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.100]   Should there be a Twitter oversight board?
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.180]   Well, we don't let the thing is it's not our choice.
[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.180]   It is not our choice.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:06.180]   We don't let them do it.
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:08.860]   These companies are doing doing it on their own.
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:14.220]   I think you're upset to see some board like this set up for Twitter.
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:18.980]   But I do think that we need a view with nuance, which is, you know, let's look at the good
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:23.900]   for what it is, but also understand that part of it might be to defer criticism.
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.180]   I agree to that situation.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.180]   That's bad.
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:28.420]   It's an intransigent problem.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:30.180]   It's almost insoluble problem.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:32.020]   It's better to do something than nothing.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.180]   Exactly.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:39.140]   On the other hand, I have to say I maybe it's just me, but I feel like the day of Twitter
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:42.140]   and Facebook is those days are waning.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.300]   I don't know what's going to replace them.
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:44.620]   I don't know what the next thing is.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:45.620]   Maybe it's TikTok.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:46.620]   I don't know.
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:47.620]   Maybe it's not social media.
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:50.940]   My sense is maybe people are a little fed up with social media.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.380]   Is that just me, Ed?
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:59.500]   Or does it feel like that's Facebook and Twitter were very 2010?
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:05.580]   I'm afraid I'm way too deep into these things.
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.580]   Well, not into Facebook.
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:13.540]   I've been gone from Facebook for several years now and do not miss it one bit.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:21.100]   I see evidence that Facebook's hypergrowth in the United States has stopped.
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:24.020]   Well, yeah, because they have everybody except for you and me.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.580]   Because they have everybody.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:29.700]   But there's no indication that their influence has stopped.
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:36.540]   There's no indication that Twitter's influence in terms of controlling the tentacles.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:41.660]   Of attention to media has stopped.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:49.260]   But the whole thing about the advisory board strikes me as pure PR.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:55.980]   Because there's a thousand things that are happening every day that are having negative
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:59:03.900]   impacts on communities, on businesses, on people, on countries, on ethnic groups.
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:10.500]   And the advisory board is only going to deal with the high profile ones that are too hot
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:13.100]   for Mark Zuckerberg to handle.
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:20.060]   And so it becomes a way to shovel those off and say, see, we have an independent board
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:21.460]   dealing with these.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:30.020]   Well, the horrible things that are happening on a more granular level, on a more local level
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:38.700]   are still happening and are still at the mercy of Facebook's horribly broken or non-existent
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:42.860]   content moderation architecture.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:45.300]   So who should do that?
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.780]   I don't know who should do that.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:52.820]   I wish that the fact that we're in a situation where somebody was able to build a thing where
[01:59:52.820 --> 02:00:01.900]   three billion people in the world are able to launch a genocide.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:04.540]   Nobody thought about that from day one.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:08.180]   The idea that somebody has to say, well, whose job is it to fix that?
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:12.980]   It seems to me that we're asking the wrong question here.
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:22.620]   Well, I think that Facebook is something that has been a force that clearly Zobba, who
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:28.020]   Zuckerberg built it to be the force that it is, but can you predict every single impact
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:32.300]   that this device, machine, whatever is going to have?
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:34.300]   And I think that's what Facebook is dealing with.
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:40.340]   You can't predict every single impact, but you could predict the negative outcomes that
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:41.900]   were going to happen here.
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:46.260]   And none of them were accounted for in the original thing.
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:56.460]   People who know how networks work saw this coming a decade ago, a decade and a half ago,
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.420]   and nobody listened to them.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:02.260]   And now we're at the position where, well, who's going to deal with it?
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:05.620]   It's just what we have.
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:12.700]   Burning Facebook to the ground doesn't seem to me to be, should not be rejected as an
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.700]   option.
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:15.700]   What about all the good that Facebook's done?
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:21.220]   I mean, the connections people have had, the impact it's had for businesses.
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:23.620]   Jeff Jarvis always points to George Floyd.
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:29.900]   The first videos of his murder were on Facebook.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.020]   So yeah, they've done some good.
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:33.820]   I mean, it's done good and bad.
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:37.660]   And I think like anything else that's new, there's going to be a learning curve.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.740]   And I'm not, believe me, I'm not defending Facebook.
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:40.740]   I'm not on there either.
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:47.100]   I mean, I'm on there in a public way, but privately, I'm done with it because it was no longer providing
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:50.220]   me the value that I wanted, right?
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:56.980]   And Twitter, I mean, I use Twitter and I think Twitter is quite possibly the perfect social
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:57.980]   media.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:01.460]   Twitter to me is a phone number that everyone has access to, right?
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:06.260]   If you tweet me, theoretically, I'm looking at my tweets and I can see your message along
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.620]   with anyone else in the world.
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.420]   I think that's amazing.
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:15.380]   And is Twitter, to me, a lot of nonsense and things that just kind of percolate that are
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:17.380]   kind of give me a break?
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:18.380]   Sure.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.900]   Do I think it should go away or be burned to the ground?
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.900]   No.
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:29.260]   And I think that, and to answer Leo with social media in general, I mean, look, this is a
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.740]   force in our world that will never go away.
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:39.100]   It might be reinvented, but at this point, we see the TikTok, like you said, and we see
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.820]   that Instagram is still just beginning to grow.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.740]   I mean, it's still just at the beginning.
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:52.300]   And the influence that that has on travel, on places people go on everything is just absolutely
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:53.580]   unbelievable.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:55.700]   And will there be something else to overtake it?
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:56.700]   Maybe?
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:00.820]   You know, in Facebook, I think there's, you know, I think there's, I don't know, as someone
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.820]   who uses it in a public way, I think it's amazing.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.980]   You know, I took a video yesterday, I posted it and I, the comments and the discussion
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.620]   I get on my page is just phenomenal.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.740]   And I find it to be really interesting.
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:14.180]   And you know, not in the political world.
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:15.180]   So maybe that's it.
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:19.820]   I'm just, you know, I talk tech, but I will say I have seen in the past couple of years
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:22.380]   the political fallout on my tech page.
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:27.340]   You know, I worked for a news station and people used to take what I said as it was
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:28.340]   real.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.860]   And now every time I post something, well, how do I know you're real?
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:32.140]   How do I know this is not fake news?
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:35.020]   I mean, it's, you know, the impact has been seen across the board.
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:38.060]   And I do find that part quite interesting as well.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:42.700]   I think Leo, the question that you asked about, you know, what's going to happen is, and our
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:47.420]   Facebook and Twitter going by the wayside was really fascinating because I think right
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:52.980]   now we're living in the most dynamic moment as far as these social media companies go
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:57.940]   that I've seen since I started covering them about a decade ago, which is that we now have
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:01.140]   TikTok is insurgent and TikTok is unbelievable.
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:06.500]   I mean, there's so many complications with TikTok, but the product itself is incredibly
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.500]   addicting.
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:12.980]   And I just picked it up during lockdown because I was bored and I am sucked in all the way.
[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:15.460]   And I think that poses a serious challenge to Facebook.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:16.900]   Then you think about some of this.
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:18.860]   And I would point out before you move on.
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:19.860]   Yeah.
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:25.940]   It also points out that what we might have thought of for years is imp the possibility
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:29.940]   of dethroning Facebook is not impossible.
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:31.900]   Because there are new ways to do stuff.
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:32.900]   There are new ideas.
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:34.820]   You said Clubhouse, another example.
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.820]   Yeah.
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.740]   And now Facebook and Twitter are running.
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:41.180]   They're not walking to copy Clubhouse.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:45.820]   Twitter with space as Facebook, I think, is about to announce something on Monday.
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:50.980]   And so I would say the incumbents are under threat.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:52.540]   Was that some breaking news or what?
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:53.540]   Or is that?
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.540]   There was a report.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:57.620]   There was a report today that was coming.
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:04.820]   Peter Kafka reported something today about what Facebook's announcements are going to
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:05.820]   be.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:07.540]   And it's very much a Clubhouse clone.
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:08.540]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:09.540]   What a surprise.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:10.540]   For the money, I think.
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:11.540]   Yeah.
[02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:14.260]   Just like Instagram copied stories.
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:20.260]   I mean, if nothing else, Facebook's very adept at copying other people and buying what
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:22.540]   they can't copy.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:26.340]   And I think you could make this strong argument that Facebook's success really has come from
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:31.940]   the fact that they put Instagram and WhatsApp quickly out of business by buying them and
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:35.260]   making sure that their success was Facebook's success.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:39.860]   Maybe the same thing with Oculus, I don't know.
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:45.300]   And Facebook putting stories on Instagram immediately kind of hurt Snapchat when they
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:46.300]   couldn't buy them.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.300]   I don't know.
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.980]   It's an interesting thing.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:50.980]   It's an interesting thing.
[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:55.380]   I just don't feel like Facebook owns the future necessarily or Twitter at all.
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:57.860]   It feels less so now than it has in a long time.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:00.380]   It's a dynamic moment, as you say.
[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:01.780]   And look at the failures of Facebook.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:04.140]   I mean, look at how many things they've started that.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.860]   I mean, remember a couple of years ago, they did that big Facebook watch push where they
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:11.500]   were getting into shows that they were producing.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.940]   And it's like, a lot of the stuff that these companies do never works out.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:16.500]   I mean, Google's the same way.
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.500]   You know, there's primers for--
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.500]   Google's the king of failures.
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.500]   Yes.
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:21.500]   Yes.
[02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:23.180]   People's so good at that.
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:25.980]   Yeah, but we want them to fail.
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:26.980]   But that's what I'm saying.
[02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:30.300]   So it gives us hope for the fact that Facebook is huge.
[02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:34.300]   They've got 3 billion people on the platform and they couldn't make shows where they paid
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:38.180]   people millions of dollars to produce YouTube style shows.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.340]   They couldn't make that work.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:47.020]   So that gives us hope that this is not just a numbers game of just pushing their way into
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:48.020]   things.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.020]   Right.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:52.260]   Well, one interesting thing about Facebook watch is after they invested all that money
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:56.580]   into it, they all of a sudden did a study and they found out that passive consumption
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:00.420]   on Facebook actually makes people feel bad as they shifted the algorithm.
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:01.420]   Oh, that's right.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:02.420]   I remember that.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:03.420]   That's right.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.420]   And they went watch.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:05.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:10.980]   So Facebook, if they're going after Clubhouse, you might also say they're going after Spotify
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:17.780]   or at least the podcast ambitions of Spotify.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:24.500]   So they're going to, a podcast discovery product will be connected with Spotify.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:28.740]   It's very interesting.
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:37.340]   I think so that I don't know if I think Mark Zuckerberg is a product genius or not.
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:39.740]   I think there's a lot of evidence he's not.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:46.420]   Well, I would argue that none of the current tech CEOs are product geniuses.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:52.420]   What they do very well is listen to their employees and then elevate those ideas to people who
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:55.460]   can actually make decisions and end up building the stuff.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:58.780]   Like Jeff Bezos didn't come up with all the stuff we talked about at Amazon on his own,
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.340]   but he's a very good listener.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.660]   And I would say the same with Zuckerberg.
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:05.700]   We talked a little bit about the oversight board having 9,000 things because they asked
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:07.940]   for feedback and they have to delay.
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:08.940]   And that didn't come out of nowhere.
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:13.700]   I mean, it is the Facebook oversight board and the Facebook ethos is all about feedback.
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:16.140]   And Facebook wouldn't be where it is today.
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:20.060]   If there weren't specific people inside the company that pulled Zuckerberg over and said,
[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:22.100]   you know what, Mark, you're doing it wrong.
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.060]   And if we don't do it this way, we're in trouble.
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:25.220]   That happened with mobile.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.220]   That happened with stories.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:32.340]   And so, you know, I think the nice thing for Facebook is that Zuckerberg actually will
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:34.060]   listen.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:35.940]   And that's how they've been able to stay relevant.
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:36.940]   Yeah.
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:38.340]   Let's take a quick break.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:39.340]   Lots of little stories.
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:42.260]   I want to kind of do a speed round when we come back.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.660]   But first, because it is getting late.
[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:48.820]   Next to a word from Uber for Business are sponsored for this segment of this week in
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:49.820]   tech.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:54.780]   It's hard to find easy ways, simple ways to keep employees engaged, to keep customers
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:58.900]   happy, especially now when you can't really do face-to-face interaction.
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:03.500]   If you're looking for a way to stand out to your customers or make your employees feel
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:07.700]   extra valued, I want to point you at Uber for Business.
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:09.540]   What a great idea.
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.940]   You know Uber has a way to request rides to order meals from restaurants you love.
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:20.380]   But Uber has a platform for businesses, specifically for businesses to spiff their employees and
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:21.740]   their customers.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:28.020]   Over 150,000 companies use Uber for Business to improve customer and employee satisfaction.
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.380]   I'll give you some examples.
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:34.740]   I had $20 to somebody's personal Uber account and say, "Come on.
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:42.260]   I'll buy you a ride to our next event or I'll buy you a coffee while you attend our meeting."
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:44.180]   Or just to thank an employee for working late.
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:46.380]   Buy them a meal from Uber Eats.
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:49.260]   It's a great way to make customers love your business even more.
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:53.220]   Offer them a voucher for a free meal or a ride when they make their first purchase or
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:54.700]   spend a certain amount.
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:55.700]   Here's the great thing.
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:57.340]   Uber for Business is easy for you.
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:59.260]   You can sign up for free.
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:03.740]   You can immediately, I mean like before I'm done with the ad, start delivering extra value
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:06.460]   to the people who matter most to your business.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.420]   Vouchers couldn't be easier to send.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.060]   Same thing for redeeming them.
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:13.380]   You get total control over who gets them when they expire.
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:17.820]   You can even say what portion of the ride or what portion of the meal you want to cover.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:23.540]   You share them via email or by text and they can be redeemed just with a click.
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:28.740]   And based of all, you don't pay for any rides or any meals until they take the ride or they
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:29.740]   order the meal.
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:35.540]   So it's a great way to get some great stuff out and maybe not even cost you too much.
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.940]   For a limited time, in fact, I'm going to make it an even better deal.
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:42.140]   Get a $50 voucher when you create your first voucher's campaign and spend $200.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:46.500]   Go to uber.com/twit to find out more uber.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:55.140]   U-B-E-R.com/twit terms and conditions apply at uber.com/twit.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:56.660]   Wow.
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:57.660]   Wow.
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:59.020]   Amazon.
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:06.180]   You know they're doing the Lord of the Rings TV show, I guess, for Amazon Prime.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.380]   They're going to do a series.
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:11.420]   We knew they spent $100 million to buy the rights.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:19.900]   Now they say it will cost $465 million for the first season.
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:23.460]   This is what a crazy world we're in now.
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:27.300]   Almost half a billion dollars.
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.300]   It's good for New Zealand.
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:32.100]   The New Zealand Minister of Economic Development Tourism says this will be the largest television
[02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:33.980]   series ever made.
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:37.860]   One season, almost half a billion dollars.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:40.060]   I'm sorry, they spent $250 million for the rights.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:41.420]   They spent a quarter of a billion.
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:47.980]   So there are already almost two billion dollars before they've even aired anything.
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.500]   All right.
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.500]   Nothing to say.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.500]   That's the story.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:54.500]   There you go.
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:55.500]   I'm into it.
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:56.500]   I can't wait.
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:57.500]   I like those movies.
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:58.500]   You got Tom, the whole season.
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:00.020]   How much does that money pay?
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:02.020]   How much does movies cost?
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:04.100]   I mean, they were...
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.620]   I'm sure hundreds of millions of dollars you're right.
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:09.060]   And the Lord of the Rings, there were three of them, three Hobbits.
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:11.020]   So you're right.
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.900]   But it means, I guess what I like about it means they're going to put the kind of production
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.020]   value into it that was put in the original movies, right?
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.580]   I just pulled it up.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:23.900]   93 million for the Lord of the Rings extended cut fellowship of the rings.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:24.900]   That's one of three.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:25.900]   So 300 million total.
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:26.900]   Yeah.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:27.900]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:34.700]   But what it does tell you is how this market has been bid up by Netflix, by Amazon, Prime,
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:35.780]   by HBO.
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:37.380]   This has become...
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:42.100]   I think some of it's due to pandemic, but I think this has really become a very fat market.
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:44.500]   And boy, it's a great time for it to be a content creator.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.900]   I got to get that script out of the bottom drawer.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.900]   Great time to watch stuff too.
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:55.100]   Yeah, it's a great time to be a content consumer.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:01.300]   Have you seen that the time lapses from Google Earth is actually maybe a little too depressing,
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:05.860]   showing the devastating effects of climate change?
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:12.140]   You can actually watch as climate change progresses.
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:18.580]   You have to go to Google Earth, click on the Voyager tab, and then search for one of five
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:24.300]   guided tours about forest change, urban growth, warming, temperatures, mining, and renewable
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:26.900]   energy resources.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:27.900]   Here's a GIF.
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:35.380]   It'd be easier for me just to show this of how Cape Cod has changed over time, or the
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:38.740]   glacier retreat, the Columbia Glacier.
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:40.420]   Bye-bye, Glacier.
[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:41.420]   Bye-bye.
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:46.620]   Thank you, Google, for really, really bringing the showdown.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:51.180]   How about that, Lord of the Rings, for $400 million?
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:57.420]   New surface laptop for Paul Thorett was so unimpressed, but surely you're more excited.
[02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:58.420]   No.
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:59.420]   Okay.
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:12.060]   I mean, this is a very nice, I did actually an article this week sort of analyzing what
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.580]   the surface product lineup is right now.
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:22.220]   In every case, they get to the point where they identify, design, and build a successful
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:25.900]   product, and then they stop, and they iterate on it.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.980]   This is iteration.
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:29.980]   It works.
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:37.980]   How important is this business to Microsoft?
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:46.180]   They say that there's two aspects of it, and the biggest part of it is to serve as an example
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:47.180]   to their...
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:48.180]   Almost a reference.
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:49.180]   For the audience.
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:53.260]   Oh, we have partners, a reference platform or something.
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:15:01.340]   The other is to be a place where people can say, "All right, this is how Windows should
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:02.340]   work."
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:11.060]   Third-party hardware and third-party crapware has always been the Achilles heel of the Windows
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.940]   hardware ecosystem.
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:20.820]   That was the twin goals of this, but now that they've got it up to making $2 billion a quarter,
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:24.060]   it strikes me that this is no longer a reference platform.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:29.140]   This is a business, and what they're really doing instead of being a reference platform
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:36.980]   is being a competitive spur to the partners and saying, "Look, be better than us, and
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:40.020]   you can make lots of money.
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.580]   If you keep...
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:43.500]   Don't shovel crapware onto things.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:51.420]   Don't deliver cheap plastic stuff that breaks or that blue screens every time you turn it
[02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:53.780]   on, step up your game."
[02:15:53.780 --> 02:16:00.500]   There's not so much a reference platform anymore as a baseline competitor.
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:03.820]   Let me ask you this though, because I was thinking about this in the conversation on
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:07.140]   Windows Weekly with Paul and Mary Jo.
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:08.140]   The Surface...
[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:09.980]   There's a Surface laptop.
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:11.660]   The Surface Book even still around.
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:12.660]   That was the convertible.
[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:13.660]   Yes.
[02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:14.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:15.660]   It's quite successful.
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:16.660]   It's Book 3.
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:17.660]   Okay.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:18.660]   Yeah.
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:20.820]   But really, when you say Surface to people, they think of the convertible, the tablet that
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:26.340]   the keyboard comes off, which Microsoft clearly made in response to Apple's iPad.
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:31.820]   I know there are other convertibles, but they don't see very many of them.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:36.780]   Are the OEMs looking at that and going, "Yeah, no, we're not going to make the detachable
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:39.900]   keyboard thing?"
[02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:40.900]   The detachable...
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:44.420]   So there's six product lines in the Surface.
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:46.340]   Three of them have kickstands.
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:52.940]   Three of them are conventional notebooks with the Surface Book being the one that is detachable
[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:55.420]   if you wanted to, but you don't have to.
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.420]   And nobody did.
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:17:00.620]   I mean, I owned one for years and I've never took this credit off.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:02.620]   But I think other people...
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:03.620]   Some people might.
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:12.820]   It's a niche market, but if you were an architect or a designer, you might find that.
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:13.820]   Maybe that's it.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.820]   I don't have the use case.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:19.020]   You know, Microsoft talks about first line workers holding the Surface in their arm as
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:22.060]   they check guests into a flight or things like that.
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:24.380]   And that's not me.
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:25.380]   I use a laptop.
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:27.380]   If I'm going to use a laptop, I want a laptop.
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:28.380]   I don't even want to...
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:32.540]   I don't want to go back to your original question, what people think of the Surface.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:40.340]   When you say people, I think you're thinking of consumers like tech savvy consumers like
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:45.900]   us who were paying attention 10 years ago or nearly 10 years ago when this was...
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:49.540]   They did the click ad and they were twirling around.
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:52.380]   That was nine years ago.
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:57.980]   The iPhone was one year old when that came out.
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.460]   That was a long time ago.
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:08.500]   Right now, the Surface is a business-centric family of PCs and a business-centric brand.
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:12.260]   And most of what you see is coming through the commercial channel right now.
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:13.060]   So from a consumer-
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.420]   And that's what Paul explained to me.
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.420]   Right.
[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.580]   And that's why there's no ThunderBolder or USB 4 ports.
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:21.980]   Businesses are very conservative.
[02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:23.220]   And I was surprised.
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:26.020]   I thought of it as a consumer product, but it's really a business product.
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:28.620]   Well, I think consumers are going for cheaper alternatives.
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.620]   That's the main thing.
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.740]   These are very expensive computers.
[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:33.740]   And they're beautiful.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:37.300]   I mean, if I was purchasing a Windows laptop, this would be what I'd want.
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:38.900]   Which one would you get?
[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:40.100]   I'd go for the Surface laptop.
[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:41.780]   I don't need the detachable thing.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:45.700]   I like just a conventional ultrabook pretty much.
[02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:46.700]   Yeah.
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:48.340]   And these start at $1,000.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:51.580]   These are the high end of things.
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:54.780]   But they do offer some advantages for if you like the Windows platform.
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:58.460]   I think they're a really nice device.
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:18:59.460]   But they're expensive.
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:01.700]   So the consumer, even when you look at...
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:04.180]   They came out with that Surface...
[02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:05.420]   It was like the Surface Go.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:07.420]   And it was like it started at like $3.29.
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:08.420]   It was supposed to be cheaper.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:11.820]   But when you add it everything up, you know, what they show on those commercials, you add
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:15.820]   up the keyboard and you add up the pen, it gets pretty pricey.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:20.500]   And consumers want something they go into Best Buy for sub 500.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:24.220]   That's probably the most popular kind of laptop price for the average person.
[02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:25.220]   Yeah.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:26.740]   So a couple of things there.
[02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:27.740]   Yeah.
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:28.740]   A couple of things there.
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:37.340]   In one, the prices are... you can match them up unit for unit against MacBooks.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:38.340]   So they're...
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:39.340]   They're very similar.
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:40.340]   They're expensive also.
[02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:41.340]   Yeah, they're very similar.
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:42.340]   The prices are...
[02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:43.340]   Yeah.
[02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:44.340]   The prices are...
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:45.340]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:46.340]   ...almost identical.
[02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:47.340]   And the Surface...
[02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:48.340]   But most consumers are buying MacBooks.
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:49.340]   Well, right.
[02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:55.580]   But most of the people, most of the cheap PCs that are out there have zero profit margin
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:56.580]   in them.
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:20:03.220]   So the only people who are in those businesses are people who can survive on microscopic
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:09.540]   margins like Lenovo, which can make them by the gazillion and shove them through Wal-Mart
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:13.500]   and make $10 on each one and be done with it.
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:19.700]   But the product that you actually want there is what's called the Surface Laptop Go, which
[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:22.820]   was the one that came out last fall.
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:28.260]   And you can get one for about 600 bucks and it's actually a pretty decent PC.
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:29.260]   Yeah.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:31.900]   And the cheap computers, by the way, are horrible.
[02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:32.900]   I mean, they're...
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:36.460]   Yeah, I was trying to talk consumers out of it, but it's hard to tell somebody...
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:37.460]   Yeah.
[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:38.460]   It's really hard.
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:39.460]   It's been more than 500 bucks.
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:40.460]   Sorry.
[02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:41.460]   Exactly.
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:42.460]   And guess what?
[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:43.460]   They don't last very long.
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:44.460]   So when you're talking...
[02:20:44.460 --> 02:20:45.460]   $1,000 seems really expensive.
[02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.460]   False economy, yeah.
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:47.460]   Yeah.
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:52.340]   And by the way, one little tidbit I learned doing a story at the Microsoft Store back when
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:55.580]   they existed, and Ed, this goes kind of back to what you're saying about the crapware
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:21:00.460]   on these things, is that if you bought a computer at the Microsoft Store, whether it
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:06.140]   was a Surface or a third party, those computers were not allowed to have crapware on them.
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:07.140]   So they could not have all that.
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:08.140]   The signature piece.
[02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:09.140]   The signature.
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:10.140]   Yeah.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:11.140]   Microsoft signature program.
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:12.140]   Yeah.
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:13.140]   I thought that was pretty interesting.
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:14.140]   Nobody did it.
[02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:19.140]   You see them all over, right?
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:20.140]   No.
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:21.140]   No.
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:22.140]   No.
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.140]   No.
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:25.180]   They must make a lot of money on that trialware.
[02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:29.340]   Actually, it's funny that we're talking about cheap laptops because Nielei Patel did
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:37.580]   a piece on the Verge, a little trip down memory lane talking about the netbook.
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:42.220]   There was an example of how the public's thirst for cheap really backfired.
[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:44.540]   I think it hurt the PC industry for years.
[02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:49.140]   People's sense of what a cheap PC could do was really damaged by that.
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:52.780]   That may be the other reason why Microsoft makes these surfaces just to remind people
[02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:56.980]   a Windows experience could be gorgeous and nice, right?
[02:21:56.980 --> 02:22:01.820]   And if you're the average consumer that spent, let's say, $2.50 on a netbook back in the
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:07.280]   day, and it's terrible, from the first boot up, you realize, "Why is this so slow and horrendous
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:08.280]   in the screen?
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:11.020]   You can't view it from any angle of the exact term."
[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:12.500]   But you just spent $2.50.
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.500]   And what do you do?
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:15.140]   You got to stick with it for as long as humanly possible.
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:19.660]   So now you have this computer for four years that just is terrible.
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:21.380]   And it's torture, exactly.
[02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:24.300]   And it's trashing the brand.
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:25.300]   Exactly.
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:30.340]   Every company that is aligned with it, so that Intel sticker on it, I hate Intel.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:34.620]   That Windows sticker on it, I hate Windows.
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:39.780]   Whatever other stickers are on that thing and whatever bundled software came with it,
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:49.260]   people, that was sort of the golden age of the Mac, right then, as people migrated to
[02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:51.420]   Mac form in droves.
[02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:52.420]   It probably helped them.
[02:22:52.420 --> 02:22:53.940]   It says, "Oh, you get what you pay for."
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:54.940]   Spent a little more money.
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:57.300]   And so you go to the Apple Store and they're like, "Oh, let me show you our cheapest computer
[02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:59.100]   for $9.99 or whatever."
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:00.420]   And you're like, "Oh, never mind."
[02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:03.380]   And by the way, you mentioned the stickers.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:05.460]   Why did they allow stickers on these computers?
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:07.620]   I mean, come on.
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:09.420]   Ten dollars each.
[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:13.820]   I had a meeting with Michael Dell one time.
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:17.220]   And I asked him that question about the crapware and everything.
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:24.780]   He said to me, "How much would you pay to not have these bundled software and stickers
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:25.780]   on there?"
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:28.420]   And I said, "I don't know, 20, 25 bucks?"
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:29.420]   He says, "Soul.
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.420]   I'll take it."
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.420]   That's all it takes.
[02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:33.340]   That's all they make on that crap.
[02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.740]   That's how much they made on that thing.
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:37.140]   And yet that was their entire profit margin.
[02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:38.140]   That's the thing.
[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:39.140]   That's the key about it.
[02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:40.660]   That's their profit margin.
[02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:44.700]   And hold on, what is Amazon doing with the Kindle and all those fires?
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:51.460]   They've got those ads on the lock screen and you have to pay like $20 to get rid of them.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:54.580]   They're actually less annoying though than the stickers in the bundle.
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:55.580]   Well, yes.
[02:23:55.580 --> 02:23:58.540]   But it's the digital sticker.
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.460]   Your home screen has an ad for something.
[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:03.540]   You guys get it on Dogecoin?
[02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:05.700]   32 cents.
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:09.100]   400% up in a week.
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:15.540]   This was a joke cryptocurrency based on the Shina Ibu Doge meme.
[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:24.900]   Father Robert, I was going to trade my GameSpot stock for you.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:31.020]   On Monday, executives from GM Ford, the chip manufacturers, met with the president Biden
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:35.700]   pledged $50 billion, not nearly enough to solve the chip shortage.
[02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:41.780]   Unfortunately, it's going to be with us for a while, probably according to Pat Galsinger
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:45.100]   of CEO of Intel into 2023.
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:49.980]   Intel's building two new plants in Arizona, TSMC is committing $12 billion to build a
[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:52.780]   plant in Arizona as well.
[02:24:52.780 --> 02:25:00.500]   But thanks to natural disasters, COVID-19, exponential consumer demand.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:05.220]   There are car assembly lines shut down.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:10.340]   You can't get a lot of parts, and that's going to last for a couple more years.
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:15.580]   $50 billion from the government is part of his infrastructure plan.
[02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.780]   Galsinger says that's not nearly enough.
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:23.620]   I welcome it, but we need even more.
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:28.300]   So just bad news if you're looking for an NVIDIA GTX 3080.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:29.300]   Good luck.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:34.100]   Oh gosh, there's so much little stuff.
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:39.780]   The ingenuity helicopter flies tomorrow for a brief period of time.
[02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:40.780]   Exciting.
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:41.780]   Yes.
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:42.780]   Yeah.
[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:43.780]   It's on Mars.
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:45.700]   That's on Mars.
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:50.140]   Yeah, wouldn't be a story if we were on Earth.
[02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:52.140]   It's a story on Mars.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:57.660]   The dual prop helicopter first of its kind for Mars.
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:00.820]   Is that an Uber sticker I see on the wing there?
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:02.820]   Remember last season?
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.700]   Remember last CES?
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:11.500]   There were at least two different helicopter car Uber manufacturers with giant helicopters
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:13.500]   in the show floor.
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:18.940]   Did that helicopter climb out of the belly of the little rover thing?
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:21.140]   Yeah, dropped off the Perseverance rover.
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:22.140]   So cool.
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:24.140]   Yeah, really cool.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:25.140]   This is fascinating.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.140]   It's so exciting.
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:27.140]   It's so exciting.
[02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:28.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:32.260]   Like how they're doing this is just, you know, it's getting a lot of press, but it's just
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:36.980]   so like out there that you're like, this thing is, I don't know, millions and millions
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:37.980]   of miles away.
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:38.980]   I don't know.
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:42.820]   It's so far away that it's 15 minutes for the radio signal.
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:48.140]   So this thing has to fly completely autonomously because, you know, you can't control something
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:50.060]   15 minutes later, you go up.
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:52.860]   So they're going to say go and that we will know.
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:57.180]   And in fact, it's not only going to take 15 minutes to get the signal back, but because
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:01.540]   the speed of the uploads and everything, it's going to probably be three or four hours
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:04.020]   before NASA has anything to say about this flight.
[02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:06.460]   So we'll all be watching and waiting.
[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.460]   Wow.
[02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:10.060]   So is it going to give us like drone footage of what Mars looks like?
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:13.220]   Eventually, the plan is for reconnaissance for Perseverance.
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:17.420]   So it'll fly ahead, look around, say, oh, yeah, this might be interesting.
[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:19.340]   It's here's a clear path, that kind of thing.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:23.740]   Man, it's a hundred four days before, earlier, but like we are.
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:26.660]   We are really making some amazing breakthroughs.
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:27.660]   Yeah.
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:30.700]   It's pretty unbelievable watching the way that the rocket lands.
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:33.460]   Now we have a helicopter that's going to fly around Mars.
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:35.820]   I mean, this stuff is step changes from.
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:36.820]   You're young enough.
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.540]   You might actually be one of the first call us.
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:39.540]   You could go.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:40.540]   I'm not going.
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:41.540]   Okay.
[02:27:41.540 --> 02:27:43.540]   Just going to just give you a call.
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:46.460]   140 million, 140 million miles, by the way.
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:47.460]   Oh, man.
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:49.340]   We just did lockdown for a year.
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:53.500]   That's enough isolation for me.
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:28:00.860]   The New York Police Department is deploying spot in the Manhattan public housing complex.
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:02.860]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:08.500]   They got robot dogs, robot police dogs in New York City.
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:13.260]   I saw it made me so angry because we had been seeing all these robots and like, you
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:17.140]   know, the initial reaction is like, oh, are these robot dogs going to kill us?
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:21.260]   And of course, it's going to be the way that people use the robots that's going to be the
[02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:22.780]   issue.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:25.020]   And the fear was never the robots at the end of the day.
[02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:27.620]   It was the people controlling the robots.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:32.580]   And it just seeing that video of the two cops walking in that robot dog just, you know,
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:33.700]   sort of brought it all home.
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:36.940]   It was like, oh, yes, this is the issue.
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:38.940]   Here it comes.
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:42.380]   This is dog about science fiction.
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:45.100]   It's Robocop for crying out loud.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:46.460]   You want to possibly go wrong?
[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:47.460]   Oh, my God.
[02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:48.460]   Let's see.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:49.460]   Let's see this again.
[02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:51.540]   By the way, $70 million or something.
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:52.540]   What is that right?
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:53.540]   Can that be right?
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.540]   Is that what the headline says?
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.540]   That's a good idea.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.540]   That's ridiculous.
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:57.540]   You're robot dogs.
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:28:58.540]   Yeah.
[02:28:58.540 --> 02:28:59.540]   No, thanks.
[02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:00.540]   That's just a little too creepy.
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:08.260]   And wait, where are they deploying it first?
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.540]   In a housing project.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.180]   Yeah, go put it on the up.
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:12.180]   I'm sorry.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:13.180]   $70,000.
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:14.180]   That's a little bit.
[02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:15.180]   And what are they doing?
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:17.020]   What's this robot doing?
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:18.020]   Surveillance.
[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:19.020]   Yes.
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:24.020]   So it has cameras and it's just kind of keeping an eye on this.
[02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:29.100]   Looking around, checking out the scene, getting down on the corner with the hood.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.100]   It's bristling with sensors.
[02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:32.100]   Bristle.
[02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:33.100]   I guarantee you.
[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:37.300]   I mean, you know that the malls are doing this, you know, that night scope, I think it's
[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:41.660]   called, where it, you know, it kind of wanders around taking video.
[02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:44.180]   I mean, this is just the beginning.
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:45.660]   We're going to see a lot more of this.
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:47.620]   They're living in the future, kids.
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:49.580]   I mean, surveillance society.
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:52.220]   I mean, it's just, it's happening in a big way.
[02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:54.340]   And it's, you know, people's homes, the same thing.
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:55.900]   You know, you got cameras around your house now.
[02:29:55.900 --> 02:29:59.260]   Is that more worried about robot dogs than I am about Google flock, to be honest, to
[02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:00.260]   be fair?
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:02.020]   I would agree with you.
[02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:03.020]   Yeah.
[02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:06.620]   We have an opportunity now to like raise the alarm over this type of stuff.
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.580]   It should not be happening.
[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:12.780]   And there's going to be a slippery slope where eventually like it'll be like, well, everyone's
[02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:15.220]   doing it and then it'll be too late.
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:16.220]   Well, okay.
[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:21.020]   So now when you say it shouldn't be happening, I'm curious, like at the airport, should we
[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:26.940]   have dogs like if these dogs could do dogs, little doges, that's okay.
[02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:29.940]   She, the Hebrew comes up and sniffs your crotch.
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:31.740]   I don't mind.
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:33.060]   I'm okay with that.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.580]   But you don't, you want that robot dog sniffing you?
[02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:37.580]   I don't know.
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:40.220]   I mean, we're already over policed.
[02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:42.580]   So I don't, please don't want.
[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:43.580]   Don't want to do.
[02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:44.580]   I'm not.
[02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:46.540]   I'm not in the defund the police camp.
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:49.220]   Like I think the police play an important role in society.
[02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:54.420]   But I mean, come on, robot dog, like we can't, if we're failing with the humans that we
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:57.260]   have now, I don't think the problem is lack of technology.
[02:30:57.260 --> 02:30:58.780]   I think the problem is with the system.
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:02.940]   So why don't we look there first and then decide whether we really need robot dogs with
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:05.380]   sensors walking around neighborhood.
[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:06.380]   Yeah.
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:09.780]   But what if they could scan luggage, you know, you know, have you ever seen these dogs
[02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:12.140]   that they train to like, you know, sniff out drugs?
[02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:14.540]   I mean, that's a huge, you know, it's a, it's a big thing.
[02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:20.860]   So if you can program these robots to do that and they can scan the luggage, I mean, is
[02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:21.860]   that bad?
[02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:24.120]   I mean, it's like, where does it start and where does it end?
[02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:26.860]   The bad part of this, you know, I mean, I don't know.
[02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:27.860]   I don't know.
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:29.300]   I'm just thinking out loud.
[02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:30.300]   I don't know.
[02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:35.660]   I think that at the end of the day, like if you're doing that for a cost, like the, the
[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:38.820]   reason you would bring the robots and instead of the dogs that we have trained to do this
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:42.620]   job right now is because you want them in there for a cost thing.
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:47.820]   And I would argue that training the dogs is not the real problem with cost in our government
[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:49.420]   right now.
[02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:53.340]   You know, we have cost or is it maybe a load should be doing that?
[02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:57.620]   You know, they, these dogs, they basically, you know, I mean, they're working eight hours,
[02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:58.620]   whatever.
[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:02.620]   I mean, maybe it's better to have a robot offload that kind of job to versus an animal.
[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:07.380]   Oh, well, see, I haven't heard what the animal rights folks say about it, but I think there's,
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.180]   there's a balance, of course, between like, you know, what we want to do and whether we
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:13.660]   want to end up living in a robo-pleaky state.
[02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:16.660]   And I'd be very reticent to get us to the latter.
[02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:17.660]   Finally, we'll wrap.
[02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:18.660]   The whole question.
[02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:19.660]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:20.660]   Yeah.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:21.660]   One last, one last spot of robot dogs.
[02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:22.660]   Okay.
[02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:23.660]   Yes.
[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:24.660]   The whole question.
[02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:25.660]   Can you do that?
[02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:27.660]   We can have the longest conversation on this.
[02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:29.420]   I should never have brought that up.
[02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.420]   In all.
[02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:31.420]   Sorry.
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:38.780]   This is, this is a, almost a canonical example of a technology where that is new, that's
[02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:44.820]   just being introduced, and instead of thinking about where it can go, we're thinking about
[02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:48.020]   the processes and the deployment today.
[02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:53.340]   And the re, the reason we're in trouble with things like Facebook and, you know, genocides
[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:59.780]   and Myanmar is because nobody thought about where this is going to be in five years or
[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:06.780]   ten years where it could be and how we guide it in the right way and prevent the bad scenarios
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:07.780]   from happening.
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:11.500]   So the question shouldn't be, do we build these robot dogs?
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:12.500]   Do we deploy them?
[02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:13.500]   Where do we deploy them?
[02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:14.500]   How do we deploy them?
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:20.740]   We think about where does this end and how do we make sure that it doesn't end in a way
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:25.780]   where we say in ten years, holy crap, I didn't see that coming.
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:30.260]   Maybe the people that are building this stuff should have the dogs patrol their neighborhoods
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:31.940]   first before they put them in other.
[02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:32.940]   Good idea.
[02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:35.820]   And by the way, because we have club twit has a discord.
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:40.400]   There is a club twit channel and maybe this was a mistake, but we've allowed animated
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:43.260]   gifts and other movies in the club twit channel.
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:50.780]   Here's a video testing nine new mini cheetahs at MIT.
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:53.900]   They take little steps, but they look actually a lot like the robot dogs.
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:56.900]   I don't know if we need nine of them.
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:33:59.420]   And then of course, lots of GIFs of dancing robots.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:03.660]   So you see, you see, thank you.
[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:07.820]   Thank you club twit for your contribution.
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:15.380]   Sad note real quick, Chuck Gesheke passing away at the age of 81, co-founder of Adobe.
[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:17.540]   Kind of a legendary fellow in Silicon Valley.
[02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:22.540]   We could thank him for the tech museum in San Jose.
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:24.820]   He was one of the people who put that together.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:26.300]   It's a wonderful museum.
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:29.340]   I highly recommend it.
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:35.780]   And of course, every obituary is going to mention that he was kidnapped at gunpoint in 1992,
[02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:38.380]   held for four days.
[02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:41.660]   Suspect cocked with the $650,000 ransom.
[02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:44.620]   Eventually led police to the hideout where he was held captive.
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:51.420]   He survived unscathed, retired from the Adobe board in 2020.
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:55.420]   But quite a legendary fellow in the Silicon Valley.
[02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:02.780]   Chuck Gesheke passed away at the age of 81 on Friday, founder with John Warnock of Adobe.
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:07.620]   And Warnock and Gesheke are credited with inventing PDFs.
[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:13.220]   So next time you open a PDF, you can thank Chuck Gesheke.
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:17.620]   That concludes this robotic edition of this week in tech.
[02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:19.020]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:22.860]   Alex Cantrowitz is at sub stack.
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:26.020]   Well, he said it's bigtechnology.substack.com.
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:28.460]   Where can we go to find the podcast?
[02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:33.500]   Yeah, you could type in big technology podcast on your app choice and it should come up.
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:37.740]   And I will say that we talked a little bit about the Facebook oversight boards decision
[02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:41.580]   on Trump, which should be coming any one of these weeks.
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:43.460]   And we'll do an emergency show on that.
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:45.180]   Hopefully we'll see one of them in the decision.
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:46.180]   Oh, good.
[02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:47.180]   So stay tuned for that.
[02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:48.180]   Nice.
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:51.820]   You've got you've had some great people zane up to Becky who I really love Casey Newton,
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:55.900]   Bray, some of the best people, best voices in the business.
[02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:59.700]   So I think that's well worth listening to.
[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:01.740]   Thank you for being here, Alex.
[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:02.740]   We really appreciate you.
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:03.740]   Always a pleasure.
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:04.740]   Yeah, it's great being with you.
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:06.700]   And I love the mini surfboards behind you.
[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:08.660]   Those are really cool.
[02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:09.660]   I like that.
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:10.660]   I had to up this background game.
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:11.660]   Nice.
[02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:12.660]   Well done.
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:14.540]   We got the room raider Twitter account dunked on me pretty hard.
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:15.540]   Did they?
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:16.540]   Oh, man.
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:18.860]   Yeah, because it was just a blank wall originally.
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:20.820]   And I think they called it a hostage video.
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:23.620]   So it's been hard at work with my interior decoration.
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:25.340]   So actually what you said means a lot to me.
[02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:26.340]   Oh, good.
[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:27.340]   Yeah.
[02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:30.380]   And well, in his national park week, so it's good to have Zion behind you as well.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:31.380]   So that's good.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:32.380]   Yeah.
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:37.080]   From Santa Fe, New Mexico, it's always great to have Ed bought the creator of the EdBot
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:39.220]   report at cdnet.com.
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:40.220]   Add EdBot on the Twitter.
[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:42.060]   I love your pillow.
[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:44.060]   You see, room raider would like that pillow.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.380]   It's like a little, what is it?
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:47.380]   A guitar pillow.
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:49.140]   That is a guitar pillow.
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:50.140]   Yes.
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:51.140]   I like it.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.140]   That's cool.
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:55.580]   Anything you want to plug in, anything you up to, you want to tell the world about?
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:58.340]   No, I'm in between books right now.
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:00.140]   So is that a good feeling?
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.980]   Who was it said?
[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:04.740]   It said the best thing about writing is having written.
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:05.740]   Yes.
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:06.740]   Yeah.
[02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:08.540]   So nice having written.
[02:37:08.540 --> 02:37:14.820]   Yeah, looking forward to just doing that nice every day.
[02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:15.820]   Life.
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.420]   Every day, every week stuff.
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:19.820]   And let it just float on.
[02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:22.380]   It's Dorothy Parker who said, I hate writing.
[02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:25.460]   I love having written.
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:28.300]   Has anybody ever written a book?
[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:30.980]   We'll absolutely concur.
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:36.940]   And of course, Rich D'Amuro, who's also an author, Rich's iPhone book, in its 18th printing
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:39.780]   now.
[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:41.780]   Every iOS update.
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:43.980]   God, you're going to do one 14-5?
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:45.540]   No, no, no.
[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:50.580]   I'll do one eventually with just some basic stuff that doesn't change as much.
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:54.700]   But now I do my podcast, Rich on Tech and Instagram.
[02:37:54.700 --> 02:37:56.260]   Those are my two big things right now.
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:58.540]   Instagram, Rich on Tech, podcast, Rich on Tech.
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:37:59.540]   That's it.
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:01.940]   What do you put on the Instagram?
[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:04.740]   What's on your Insta, man?
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:08.020]   I love experimenting with just different things.
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:09.940]   I do tech stuff.
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:14.740]   I do Facebook didn't own Instagram.
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:16.420]   I actually love Instagram.
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:17.940]   I was on it day one.
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:21.620]   And if Facebook didn't own it, I'd probably still be there.
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:23.940]   But I just don't want to support Facebook in any way.
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.260]   But boy, you know.
[02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:31.620]   I find it's the nicest platform right now.
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:34.860]   Yeah, it's pictures and video.
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:37.620]   I love it.
[02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:40.020]   Well, you're rich on Instagram.
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.740]   You're rich on tech on Twitter.
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:44.220]   You're rich on tech everywhere.
[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:46.500]   That's the podcast to Rich on Tech.
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:47.340]   Thank you, Rich.
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.540]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:52.100]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific,
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.940]   530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:57.900]   You can watch a stream at live at twit.tv/live.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:00.260]   There's audio and video there.
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:02.180]   The chat room, people watching live,
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:06.420]   IRC.twit.tv on demand versions of all of our shows
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:09.900]   available at the website, twit.tv.
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:11.620]   You can also get them on YouTube.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:13.220]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:14.820]   Actually, if you go to the website,
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:16.180]   you'll see a link to the YouTube channel,
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:19.100]   also to a couple of different podcast platforms
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.700]   where you can subscribe where you're on every podcast platform.
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:23.900]   Because, well, we're a podcast.
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:26.540]   So just search for Twit and you'll be able to subscribe
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:27.420]   and get it automatically.
