[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Audible.

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Twit has convened and John C. Devorek has decided
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that he's going to play the bad kid in the back of the class
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   throwing spit wads throughout the show today.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   >> Maybe.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   >> Are you getting more sensationalistic on that blog?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   >> No, not really. It's always been kind of sensationalistic.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   >> Because I just want to read you some of the headlines
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   from the recent few posts.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Idiots at Oregon DMV find common Dutch name offensive.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Is 802.11?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now that's all right.

[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> This is Andy Inaco from the colossal waste of bandwidth
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and of course the Chicago Sun-Times, not the same thing.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   >> Not the same thing.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   One is a simulation of mirror image.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You can tell that the C-W-O-B has a go T,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   where ask the sun-times.com does not.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I will leave it to you to guess which one is evil.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   >> Easy to tell, the difference.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Is the new blog also at C-W-O-B or do you have a new URL for that?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   >> The new blog is having some secret testing done
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   at the Minnesota Salt Flats.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   If you take a guess as to what the URL might be,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   you might be able to guess where it is.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   But basically it's a test bed so I can teach myself WordPress.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Right now it is a glee, but it's getting better.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   >> I'm going to guess it's delicious.com.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Am I right?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> It's actually Google.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I bought Google last week.

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He was also for many years executive editor of the Tech TV website
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and he is a published author.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> I is self-published, yes.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Published author.

[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's deprecating.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> Self-deprecating.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   >> Hey, Tom, you in a bucket?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> He's not in a bucket.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> He's in a bucket.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> Come out of the bucket.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> How did you know?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> There's a hole in the bucket.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> There lies a--
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   >> I just downloaded-- not downloaded,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   purchased your book on Amazon.com.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's boiling point.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> What book is this?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> Boiling point.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Brave, brave man.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> It's good.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You use Lulu to publish that.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> I did, yes.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Also, how much money you're going to lose on per book?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> You don't lose anybody.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> I actually broke even because you-- well, the way Lulu works,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   every time you publish, the person who's buying the book pays for the
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   publishing.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So you don't have to outlay anything unless you want to get an ISBN.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You pay 50 bucks to get an ISBN and I've sold enough to pay for the ISBN.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So even--
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   >> Is that the ISBN--
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> You sold 50 bucks worth?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> To me alone.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   >> I looked at those Lulu terms I thought they should do.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> They're not going to be done.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   >> No, Lulu, no, Lulu's been on demand.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> You can keep all the intellectual property and you don't pay anything out front.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> You don't get any royalty.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   They take like a piece of the action and they do this.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Wait a minute, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> No.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> I like Lulu.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   This is Michael Rogers.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   >> Red Hat guy.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That's-- I confuse the two.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> Red Hat MP3.com.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> They're both, you know, guys.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> You spent the past six minutes just poking holes in your boat.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm sure it's a great book.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'm sure you can have a good time publishing it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You're a wonderful, wonderful person.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's really well-written.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> We're not really poking holes in his book at all.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> Not the look.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> You're the screen door in his submarine.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> Don't forget, Tom's the guy in the bucket and if you poke holes in a bucket, you know
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   what happens.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> Let's back up for a second since Tom just published a book, even though he did it on
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Lulu.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Let's find out what this book is about.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> Even though he did.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   >> King told him that he wasn't involved.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> I'm a published author.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I just have to be at this conference.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> What's the book?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> The book is called Boiling Point.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's about the breakup of the United States into separate countries sort of inspired by
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   the Nine Nations of North America by Joel Garro.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> I've heard enough.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   >> You've poured John in the first sentence.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Let's move on to tech news.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   What do you say?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   By the way, that's one of the stories.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Mike Harrington broke this in tech crunch.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Delicious now has a new look or will have a new look soon.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.280]   Yahoo is finally asserting itself on the delicious meme and this is going to break some old
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   time's hearts.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's going to be delicious.com.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   No more d-e-l dot i-c-i-o dot u-s.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> Why?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's too hard.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> It's a idiotic that they would change something after building a brand like that.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> You know what the numbers are on Delicious?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's a huge number of people use it.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   >> Why are they changing it?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   >> It's Yahoo.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.640]   >> There's that intelligence test of being able to figure out how to type delicious d-e-l dot
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   i-c-i-o dot u-s.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   >> Yes.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   >> As an elitist, I like the idea.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.560]   >> I think the problem is that the shareholders were pissed off that they were directing so
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.000]   many of those false click links to all those linked farms.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's traffic that should be going to Yahoo every time someone types d-e-l-i-c-v.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   >> That's true.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I've done that a few times.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   >> No, I don't know if they're going to retire d-e-l dot i-c-i-o dot u-s.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I mean, I would imagine they would keep it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Three million registered users, 100 million unique URLs bookmarked there.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We use it all the time.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I mean, if you want to know what we're going to talk about on Twitch, you can go to d-e-l
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   dot i-c-i-o dot u-s slash Twitch slash show number.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   In this case, 114.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You can see your bookmarks.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> You don't even have to do that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You just have to have slash Twitch.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You'll get because it's, you know, it's in order.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> It's in order.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   >> Sure, you're right.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> It's in order to do that.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   >> It's in order to do that.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   >> It's in order to do that.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   >> It's in order to do that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   >> It's in order to do that.

[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   >> It's in order to do that.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.800]   >> I got a interview request from a marketplace, the public radio show, because they were
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.720]   at the TechCrunch 40 and PowerSet announced at TechCrunch 40.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.280]   This is a new search engine that got $12.5 billion of funding.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.080]   Their whole ideas are going to do natural language processing.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.040]   They're using smart AI, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.840]   They called hoping that I would say, "Oh, this is exciting."
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   I said, "Forget it.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:29.360]   >> Here's my favorite thing, because I actually wrote about this too, is that PowerSet has
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   got what?
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.600]   $12 and a half million funding.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.480]   Google's R&D budget is $2.2 billion due to math.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.280]   >> How are you going to compete against Google?
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   I'm not saying Google's a BLN doll.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   In fact, I think there's some serious concerns.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   >> I'm going to compete against the Zoom button, against the iPod.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.920]   There's room for improvement.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.840]   There's room for alternative ideas.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   >> What would you do better?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.880]   >> Whenever I see your product that has to be changed.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   >> We should do.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.600]   >> I'm thinking that these are some people who don't care about improvements.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.040]   >> We need a Zoom killer.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.960]   >> I think Google is constantly improving.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.560]   I'm surprised to hear you say that, Andy.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.280]   For instance, two years ago and a year ago, all these link farms were just polluting Google's
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   results.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.760]   They've cleaned that up completely.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.640]   >> Again, I'm not saying they've never changed anything.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.200]   Just today, I was at my mom's house.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.760]   She wanted to know how many cups were in a pint or something.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.920]   I'm like, wouldn't sailing ships were applying the Atlantic the last time anybody really
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   used this stuff?
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.080]   Of course, I had my laptop in front of me.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.360]   >> You Google cups pying, right?
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.440]   >> One pint in cups and it answered that.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   Excellent.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.480]   But again, I'm just asking the question.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.080]   Is this main search page where you enter search terms and you get one plain list ordered
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.920]   by whatever secret mojo they're using to decide what's important and what's not?
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.800]   Is that the end all of the idea of internet search?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   >> The interface or?
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.880]   >> I'm talking about the search box.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.840]   >> I'm talking about the results.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.600]   >> I'm talking about the way it organizes this results and the way it presents them to
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   you.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.520]   Ask.com and Yahoo and the rest have some interesting types to it where they're saying, well, are
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.280]   you interested in the medical version of this?
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.320]   Are you looking in the geographic version of this?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.600]   Oh, and incidentally, if you are interested in the geographic version of it, there are
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.800]   a bunch of other places in the world that tend to be very, very closely linked to this.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   I keep trying these other ones.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.360]   I changed my default search in Firefox to Yahoo or ask.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.160]   I do it for a few days and it's always back to Google.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   >> Exactly.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.000]   I think that's something that works well.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   No presentation-wise.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.120]   >> Yeah, I mean, again, it's a good basic search.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.400]   I'm just curious to know why they never, ever add anything to the basic look of it.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.160]   Because the number one result is almost always the result you want.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   And I don't know.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   That's not for me.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.920]   Plus, again, you can say the same thing about Windows, but how many people in this group
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.240]   think that Windows is the best operating system out there?
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   >> I do.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   >> Tech Crunch.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   >> Yeah, but you're talking to a horse, though.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   >> I'm just kidding.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   I'm kidding.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   I kid.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   I kid.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.400]   >> You're a kid, everybody knows that John C. Devorek is a Solaris fan.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.640]   Tech Crunch 40, other stories from that big event in San Francisco this week.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.280]   The number one, I guess they won the $50,000 Tech Crunch prize, a site that I fell for
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.960]   for five minutes and then terrifiedly begged to cancel my account, mint.com.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.720]   Anybody play with this at all?
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   >> No.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   Let's check it out.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.360]   >> M-I-N-T.com, we are refreshing money management.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.880]   They won the Tech Crunch 40 $50,000 prize.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   The free automatic online way to manage your money.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   So what do you do?
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.520]   You sign up.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   >> You stay away.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   >> You stay well away.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.760]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   You know what?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   That smooth, minty, fresh Web 2.0 interface seduced me.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.400]   You enter in your logins to all your financial services.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.160]   >> Oh, I would never do that.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.600]   >> Oh, I did.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   And your bank accounts, your credit cards, and then it creates a nice page of what you
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.520]   are spending money on and they promise to help you save money.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.480]   All I've ever got was a Discover Card.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.000]   It'll save you $100 bucks by, you know, clearly they're making money on this.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   They've got some funding.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.800]   >> Maelas Canaga Thumprint, too.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.640]   >> I'm sure they're very trustworthy people, but I am extremely paranoid about my financial
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   information.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.960]   I would never want to give it to an online company like this.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   >> Crazy.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   And I read the privacy and security.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.720]   And they have, I mean, they're really good about all that.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   They're trusty, certified.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.880]   >> Yeah, that's what everybody says.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.160]   You know, the one thing about all those licenses, those U-LAs or whatever you want to call them,
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.880]   those things that are online, the terms of service, you know, they all, everyone who
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.000]   says they can be changed at any point without notification.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   >> And they can't.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.200]   >> Oh, Eddie, they've got all my information.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   >> Right.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.000]   They can, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   >> No, I'm just going to say what you're going to say.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   So you probably say it.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.880]   >> What I was going to say is that if you have, if you allow that to happen, then it, you
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   know, like, yeah, you always get the situation, which is the reason you do contracts, by the
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.760]   way, is that you have somebody who's your best body and he's going to do all this stuff
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   for you.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.640]   But what happens when he sells the company to some corrupt guy, which happens all the
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   time.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.360]   These companies are traded like playing cards.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.760]   It's like, you know, what's, what can happen after that?
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.000]   Because they've got all this information.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.760]   They can change the terms of service at the drop of a hat until that kind of thing ends.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.880]   I wouldn't trust any of these websites.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.600]   >> And that's why, by the way, all of our Twitter agreements are hand-shake based.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.240]   >> So terms of service can't be changed at any moment.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   >> At any moment.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.040]   >> In terms of service, they're just such a leaky sieve.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.800]   Anyway, nobody knows if they're really valid or not.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.240]   So a company could just go off and start selling your financial information and then you'd
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   have to find it out in court, forget it.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.440]   >> I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.560]   And by the way, the Chronicle picked this up.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.800]   This was a huge story.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.480]   A lot of people obviously looked at this and said, "Oh, cool."
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.400]   And I also should point out that you can do the exact same thing with quickener money
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.320]   on your own computer with your own log in securely.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.320]   >> With an encrypted file on a removable flash drive that you keep in a safe.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.080]   >> I don't know why I was, I don't, I got sucked in by.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.240]   Thank you, Mike Arrington.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Anyway.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.400]   >> It was the Minty Cool Green, though.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   It does sooty.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   >> Look at it.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.760]   It's a Web 2.0 seducer.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   Look at it.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.640]   >> It's slick for Mike and Strest.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.200]   >> It has a little bit of a kind of a too slick, a little too, you know, raw, raw.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.800]   I'm not, I don't like the look of it.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.320]   >> It's probably run by the Motion Picture Association of America.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   >> Okay.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   >> Mediate.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.880]   >> By the way, if anyone wants a good laugh, go to devorac.org/blog and read my terms of
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   service.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.720]   >> I could just imagine.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.160]   >> And it's legal, by the way.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.840]   >> Oh, you had a lawyer write it?
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.880]   >> I took it from a boilerplate.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.400]   But I modified it a little bit.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   >> Slightly.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.000]   >> Google is also, now I don't know if this is a true story or not, because it comes to
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   us from the Guardian, always a Guardian of truth and justice and the British way.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.760]   But apparently the British government is thinking of doing a US-style spectrum auction
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.000]   of the 900 megahertz frequencies.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.840]   Just as we are auctioning off the 700 megahertz frequencies in January.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:07.240]   And according to the Guardian, Google's already looking to bid, probably with the same notion.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.920]   >> That's the idea that I would make up if I were writing this story.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.360]   But I mean, how do we know?
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.040]   >> According to the Guardian, Google is considering a move into the UK wireless market.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.240]   >> Well, they're laying transatlantic cable.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.320]   They're definitely into the 700 megahertz auction in some way.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.160]   They did get, they would make sense for them if they're, you know, if they're going after
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.320]   all this bandwidth to get into that.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   >> They're doing it.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   >> That's information.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.200]   >> To make a Google phone, to do Wi-Fi, what would you do?
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.320]   >> Well, as that Google phone, we think is probably going to come out that HTC has been
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   working on.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   That's the big rumor.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.200]   >> Based on, and it would be a 700 megahertz or a 900 megahertz phone.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.160]   >> Well, it could be down the line.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.520]   You know, they get into the business of partnering up to make phones and then they start making
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.040]   devices that run their software on it.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.320]   And then they provide you the bandwidth.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.160]   I mean, you want to talk about monopolies.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.320]   There's a serious monopoly in the offing there.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   >> Yep.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.040]   >> They're from Google.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   Premium services.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.880]   >> Have they, they don't have anything like that, do they?
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   >> Tier dinner.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.640]   >> High speed premium dedicated services.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.200]   >> I buy it.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   >> Because I trust Google.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   >> It's about a month.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   >> I'll give them my bank account number.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.280]   >> Well, this is, this is, this bothers me sort of fundamentally because I remember it,
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.920]   I remember a day back in '87 when it was actually legal to just tune into cell phone conversations
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   because that was--
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   >> That was never legal.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   >> Yes, it was.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.480]   The third party role was affected.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   Yes, it was.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.800]   You could go into any store and buy them and it was perfectly legal.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.080]   There was a, there was a change made in the mid 90s when cell phone suddenly became popular.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080]   And that's when they started locking down the frequencies.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   >> All right.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.640]   Well, I do remember, okay, go ahead.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.600]   I do remember listing in myself.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   >> Okay, but because--
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   >> I remember--
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   >> I remember the question you still love to do that.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.280]   I was one of Steve's favorite games.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   >> Right.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.820]   I had my, I had my bare cat skin, because I remember specifically because I had my bare
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.880]   cat scanner that was being sold in all 50 states.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.440]   And then I needed upgrade to the next one.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.160]   But then that was the time I had a rush out, rush out, rush out and get the ones with the
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.840]   right serial numbers because when the ones that were manufactured before certain date
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.760]   were legal, the ones manufactured after them had a certain diode added to it.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.240]   And you'd have to actually missed out by fond of plans where you'd snip the diode using
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.160]   very, very tiny little pliers and get that band back.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.080]   But I mean, there used to be a principle that said that if you're broadcasting something
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.320]   over the air, then by definition, this might be for the public good.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.680]   And of course, there was sort of like loose implementation of that, but that was always
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.560]   a principle, this idea of saying, well, we're going to give you these frequencies to Google
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.040]   to make, to basically do whatever they want with it, just to Google subscribers.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   That just seems kind of nuts.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.600]   >> Well, I would hope they wouldn't do that.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.760]   And Google was pretty clear.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.080]   They wanted open access to these frequencies.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.880]   They wanted to force wholesaling and so forth in their proposed rules for the US auction.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.680]   >> It's certainly one of the better ways to fight the tiered internet is Google to go
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.640]   out there and just buy up a bunch of bad internet.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   >> Make your own internet.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   >> Make it available at a competitive price.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.360]   >> Build your own internet.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.200]   So it's that time of year again, the time of year when the billionaires fall from the
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.360]   trees, the Forbes richest people in America list is out.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.760]   >> I know my fingers crossed.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.800]   >> You got to have 1.3 billion to get on the list.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.560]   >> But the comic books last year.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.200]   >> Yeah, so far they're behind.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.400]   >> Number one, once again, Bill Gates, but he has 59 billion.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.160]   He'd have more, 102 billion if he hadn't given all that money away to charity.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   >> Fool.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   >> Dope.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   >> Fool.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   Anyway, 59 billion still makes him the richest man in the world right ahead of Warren Buffett
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.640]   who's got $52 billion.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   >> Buffet.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   >> Sheldon Adelson.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.920]   >> Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   >> How did he get?
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   How'd Shelley get up there?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   >> I don't know.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   He sure made his move.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.920]   He did some great business in those casinos and he's got a big one opening up in Macau or
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.120]   I guess it's open already.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   >> Sheldon was famous for starting for Condex.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.640]   In fact, he was the heart and soul of Condex.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.520]   He was a sharper operator than any of us imagined.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.440]   >> He sold Condex to SoftBank.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.400]   There was a good move in '95, 4.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.040]   $862 million.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   Wow.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.800]   And what's it worth now?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Nothing.

[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   And I forgot what her name was.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   But anyway, she wasn't there.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   So I started to leave and she goes by me.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   And I say, "Oh, you must be so and so."
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   And she says, "Yes, I am.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   And who are you?"
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   And I said, "Well, I'm John de Vorack."
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   And she says, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   What do you do?"
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   >> Oh, dear.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   >> And I said, "I work at Tech TV."
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   "Oh, uh, then she's pausing and goes, "Doing what?"
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   And I said, "I have a daily show that's been on for two and a half years."
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   And she then she scokes off.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   >> Yeah, must have forgotten that.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   She probably knew that, but forgot.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   >> How about maybe these idiots that were working there?
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   How about if they maybe watched the network?
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   >> They didn't own televisions, you know.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   >> I would be willing to bet, though, that advertising dollar-wise, CNET, DLTV, revision
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   three, and certainly Twit make ten times more money per spot than Tech TV ever did.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   >> You talk about CPMs, yeah, I'm sure.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   >> Absolutely.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   Well, you don't even have-- you talk about raw numbers because we have a larger audience
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   than Tech TV ever had.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.920]   Yeah, there's more reach.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   In fact, unfortunately, we don't count international listeners on Twit because all the agencies are
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   US-only, so we don't get monetized for that.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   But if that's one thing Tech TV never had was an international audience, and we've got a--
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   >> Well, that's not-- no, there was Tech TV International, it was actually the only profitable
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   arm-realistness.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   >> Oh, and that's because they sold shows to--
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   >> They sold shows and they also had networks.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   They had a whole network in China.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   >> That's what am I saying, of course, in Tech TV Canada, where is where I work now?
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   >> Which is still around.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   >> It was profitable and it's still profitable.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   So I take that back.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   But I think we do have a larger-- more than 20% of our audiences outside the US for Twit,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   anyway, and I think that's probably true for most podcasts.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   Anyway, let me take a break into mention audible.com.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   They're actually launching something pretty exciting, and I want to talk about it because
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   we are-- they're launching it on the 25th, but we are the first to talk about it on this
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.920]   show, and it is pretty exciting.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   You know that audible.com is a sponsor of the Twit Network, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Twit.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   You can subscribe to Audible and get a coupon for a free book, a credit towards a free book,
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   no obligation, you don't have to stick around.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   But now there's something else you might want to do at Audible.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   There's an event coming up.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   It's going to start on the 25th, but if you go to audible.com/TwitNow, you can download
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   the first chapter.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   I think this is kind of an interesting audible.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   This is the first time audible's done a book just for audible.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   It's called the Chopin manuscript.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   There's a Chopin manuscript in here.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   It's believed to be part of a stash that Nazis squirreled away in a church in Kosovo.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   Believed?
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   It's a forgery.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   It's not in Chopin's hand.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   It's been folded, mistreated.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   And 15 thriller writers are going to collaborate on this one chapter after another.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   You just heard Alfred Molina, who's the narrator, is one of the best actors at audible.com.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   And they're going to give you a free chapter.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   Jeffrey Deaver wrote the first chapter.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   All you got to do is go to audible.com/Twit to claim you're a chapter.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   And I think this is actually a very exciting promotion that we are really thrilled to be a part of.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:42.920]   Because even if you've already signed up and you're already a subscriber, you can get a copy of that chapter now for free.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   Just audible.com/Twit is the place to go.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   We do thank audible for their support.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   I'm going to be listening.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   Some really, some of the biggest names.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   Jeffrey Deaver, David Hewson, James Grady.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   It's kind of an intro.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   I don't know how it's going to work.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   They're each writing a different chapter one after the other.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   It's kind of an interesting collaboration.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.920]   And then Deaver starts it, but Deaver gets to write the last two chapters.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   I guess he gets to wrap it all up.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   The Chopin manuscript, they call it the most diabolical game of Pass it On.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   And then they're never conceived with today's top thriller writers picking up the story where another one left off.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   Audible.com/Twit.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   We thank them for their support.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   See, Tom, you could have done that with Boiling Point.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   They just started the first chapter.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   They're passing it around.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   Maybe I'll do that with John.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   It's an interesting way to work.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.920]   You want to take chapter two?
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   Yeah, no problem.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   Let's do it.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   All right.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   You need to tell another guy.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   That'd be fun.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   Most of the book would be you're trying to make up for somebody else's screw up and what you think it should be.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   Yeah, and us trying to screw it up.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   And then it turned out before the person you pass it on to, like, let's see them right their way out of this.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   You have to do that.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   But the other one was you follow up and you go, "But it was just a dream."
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   Every chapter.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   And then you got out of the shower.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   See, now that's your have to cooperate.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   That was a really interesting TV show we just saw, but now let's take a look at this brand new case because...
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.920]   You have to cooperate.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   You can't be fighting each other.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   Oh, writers cooperate.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   That's an interesting concept.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   Let me write that down.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   It is an interesting idea.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   You know, I'm looking forward to listening to it anyway.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   And it's a chapter by chapter.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   You can listen for free, audible.com/twit.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.920]   You had a book that you wanted to talk about too, Andy.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   I don't want to co-opt your book recommendation.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   I don't know.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   Well, I'm a big fan of this sort of stuff, so I tend to recommend lots of stuff.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   I don't want to dominate everything.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   I did have a book picked out for the last time I didn't get to do.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.920]   Tell us about what's fun.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   Which is by Ellis Peters.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   It's a mystery series featuring a Benedictine monk in medieval times.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   Oh, brother Catafil.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   It's one of those premises that as soon as I heard about it, and I heard about it through a promo on PBS for a mystery series that actually did based on the books, it was, oh my God, that's so totally a mystery I could get into.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   You think about how they would investigate crimes in medieval times, and especially what if a religious man were investigating a murder or theft or all kinds of malfeasance has taken place during a time of great civil war.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Brother Catafil came to the order, became a monk in his 40s after a whole career of being a soldier, fighting wars throughout Europe and the Middle East.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   As he's fond of saying, he came late when called, but he was indeed called.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   But for that reason, the other monks in the order don't really trust him that much as much as they would someone who grew up, who was a man of the cloths begin with.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   But nonetheless, he has knowledge of the outside world and what people are really, really like.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   He also has knowledge of science and medicine that a cloistered monk really doesn't have.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   So partly at their behest and partly on his own, he winds up being the person they go to to figure out, well, look, all the sacred relics were stolen out of the abbey and there's a dead guy on the front lawn.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   Okay, let's call him CAD file and using just the techniques that would be available to him at that time, being not just a man of science, but also a man of faith, it really is interesting to see how, just see just to see how you could have a character even behave in this sort of situation,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   particularly in this day and age when every murder is about, okay, let's bring out the green lasers and some weird lighting, 14 more computers.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   Are we going to think about the sort of personality?
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   I don't know. We need more green lasers. That'll solve the problem. More green lasers.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.920]   I've actually never heard that dialogue, but.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   Did you ever read on barrow echoes the name of the rose? Similar idea, mystery monk 1327. I love that book.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   Excellent book.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.920]   So we have any more tech news? Yeah, we have lots more. I just, we love talking about books. You can't help it.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   On audible.com, which is recorded as a citizen about ones and zeros, John, also known as binary.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   There you go. Name of the rose, by the way, is also available on all about.com read by Theodore Bacal, which must be great. I'd have to listen to that.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   I also want to, when the greatest Colombo murders ever, speaking of murder, Colombo, one of the greatest murders.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   The kill was one of the bad guys. Oh, really? I like you murder. Okay. Case one of the best six episodes of Colombo ever.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   Oh, really? Well, there you go. He's the two, the king of trivia there.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   Oh, our true. Do his solo voice instead.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   By the way, I gave you the wrong address. It's audible.com/twit. That's the free book offer, author, author, offer.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   But you can all, if you want to get the free chapter, it's audible.com/freechaptor. Audible.com/freechaptor.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   And that's... That will teach people to stop listening. There you go. And yeah, there you go. And you can download it, which others can listen to it streaming, but it's only at that URL.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   And it's only being mentioned on the Twit podcast. So I guess they're probably doing this to see if we're effective. Audible.com/freechaptor.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   I think more if we want to get back to the news, we have to get to the story about "Brest" is repressed on Facebook.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   Yes. We actually... Did we talk about that last week? No? We talked about it on one of the... I do too many shows now.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Yeah. How many shows did you do? She's a... She's a lactavist. Do you know what a lactavist is?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:17.920]   This is an anti-formula person? Yeah. She's a lactation activist. I think we did talk about this last week.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   And you've got the big flow. And there's a picture of re-prezing. There's a picture of her... For re-prising as it were.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   A picture of her breastfeeding. You can't see anything. But for some reason, Facebook decided to pull that picture off.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   Now, this actually reminds me of the Thomas Hawk story as well. These are private sites. It's not censorship when a private site says, "Look, we don't want that kind of picture on there." No, it's not.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   They're allowed to do that. Flickr is not a public resource, nor is Facebook.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   No, it's all about... You're taking the side of the sensors. Yes. You're taking the side of the sensors. Yes.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   Come on, Andy, get him. Leo, I guess, this I didn't go. Oh, no, I'm just saying that... He's swinging... He's getting his cricket bat and he's just winding it up.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   No, no, no, no. As more time goes by on the internet, I realize that... Just like getting a dial-up connection, there's always that first screech before the actual data comes in.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   And that's always been the case when these controversies arise. I agree.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   There are people who want to complain because... Oh, well! I'm going to... I'm the champion, the standard bearer of truth and justice.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   And I'm going to stick it to these corporate behemons. And then I'm weak, later, I'm like, "Okay, listen. Thank you. Thank you."
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   I guess that's okay. The guys that want to say, "Don't taze me, bro! I'm being tazed now! YouTube.slash.114.8. Everybody who's going to be seeing this on Flickr."
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   And then a week later, you find out what it's really about. And you find out that both sides actually had something rational and reasonable to say.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   On the one side, yeah, Flickr is a private concern, but also they have sort of a confident with their users to at least give the appearance of being an open forum for people to post anything they want.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Well, what they do with these forbidden pictures is I think they move them to an area of...
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   Maybe I'm wrong. I don't think they delete them. I think they move them to an area of possibly offensive. They flag them.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   I know that's all but for a better response than that. Time, go get him.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   The question is not about censorship. The question is about, you know, what do they have? They have the right to do whatever they want.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   We don't have to keep going to their site and using their service. So it's all about, you know, is this something we want to put up with?
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   And from the beginning of the first time I ever deleted someone's post from my own message board in 1996 and they claimed censorship, I've hated this idea of like, no, it's the Internet. Everything is free.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   It's like, no, it's my site. I can delete you if I want. But you don't have to come to my site. And that's the thing with Facebook.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.920]   If this really upsets you, then don't go there anymore. Take your account away. Go to Alaska.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:58.920]   It's the other day I was designing the page of my blog. The people will see when they're posting stuff when they're posting responses. And the first thing I did was design a logo that said, remember, here on the blank blank.com, the first amendment only applies to me.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   There you go. There you go. See, he's not going to beat me, John. No, none of them are. You got a bunch of yes been working for you tonight, Leo.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   The smiley face turned 25 this week. I hate the smiley face. You know, it's up for debate. We're not absolutely sure this story is true.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   The professor claims it. He claims it. Well, no, to his credit, Scott Falman, who's a professor at CMU, has the posting where he proposed it. He says, I've never seen any hard evidence that it was in use before the post.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   I've never run anybody who claims to have been it before I did, but it's always possible. I'm quoting him that someone else had the same idea. It is a simple and obvious idea after all.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   This is we're talking about the sideways smiley face, not the happy face that started in the 70s, but the colon dash right paren.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   No, but his original one was a colon. Yeah, right. I'm sorry, colon dash, right paren, which is deteriorated to just colon paren.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   I don't like that because that looks like it's a squished happy face. Why do people do that? That's squished.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   I do. That's what I do. It's easier. One glass. Exactly. Save bandwidth.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Exactly. Andy's right. You saved 30% over 30% of bandwidth by taking that dash out.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   If you're using the dash, you're costing the company you work for money.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   And it's like it's like the time when Iron Man had a nose molded into his mask. It just didn't look right.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   It is always a comic book reference. I just got to point that out.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   Sometimes it's a comic book reference. Sometimes it's relevant to you.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   The smiley face, though, doesn't have a nose. The original 70s smiley face.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   So maybe it's more accurate not to put the nose. It just seems like they're smushed together.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:41.920]   Do any of you use the raspberry face where you do the colon dash or no dash p?
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   Or is that just? I tried very hard throughout my entire lifetime never to use emoticons.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   You don't use any. I can't say I've never used one because I have.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   You have to use it.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   I'm really sorry for my emoticon lecture.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   I'm trying. I'll be back in five minutes.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   Not that long. Let's hear it.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   A emoticon server useful purpose. I remember when they first appeared on the scene probably because of this guy and some others.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   I know you don't have emotions in a written communication.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   Is that it? No, there's all these writers and all these professors.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   You should be able to express yourself without using stupid symbols.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.920]   The fact of the matter is the email and electronic communication has some other effect on people.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   They always take offense to things so easily that you needed to come up with some new model.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   And this model has got the emoticons in it so I don't have a problem with them.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   I actually use it for that reason.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   It seems to be so lame to say like, but if you're offended, I put a colon and a parent and a closed parent.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.920]   Not so much. Not so much that there's some language that can be ambiguous if you don't have gestures associated with it.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   I do use them sometimes, but also always when I'm looking, you always do that last read of an email before you click send.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   And you're like, "Oh God, that could really, really set the world on."
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   It's coding gasoline and strike a match if they don't think I'm being serious.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   It's true if you're a good writer though, you could craft it subtly to convey the exact new ideas.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   Read your email in a British accent out loud.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   I'm so sorry, sir.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   And fix it. It works every time.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   I do believe you are an ignorant slut.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   You know, I have to confess to using it.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   It's a form of laziness because it's a way of saying, you know, this is meant in jester.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   Oh, it's not. It's a form of efficiency.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   Efficiency. Why not just put LOL or ha?
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   No, I don't do LOL.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   I do it.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   You do?
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   Devorak, you will put ROTFL in an email?
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   No, not necessarily, because I've never, because I will only put the truth.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   So I actually have to be rolling on the floor.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   So many people are lying when they write ROTFL.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   How else are with a single lamp looking for an honest man?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   I believe that most people are indeed lying when they put ROTFL.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   Couple of quick stories.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   Recent study says video games do in fact hurt your GPA.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   First, your students whose roommates brought a video game player to college,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   studied 40 minutes less each day on average according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   That translates into first semester grades that were 0.241 points lower on the 4.0 grade scale.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   You know how important those 40 minutes were going to be.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   That was the 40 minutes I was going to turn it all around for you.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   You shouldn't have brought a deck of cards to college when I was a kid.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   How many people wasted away their time playing bridge poker and hearts?
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   I was going to say, did they take the games away and see if the GPA went back up?
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.920]   Or is this just the type of people who bring games or the type of people who weren't going to study anyway?
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920]   Losers!
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   You're right, Tom.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920]   They're all losers.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.920]   Not a double blind study.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   It's a bogus report, just ruin the gamers.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   I'm not buying it.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   Wow.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   Well then you probably don't like the idea of who is this the guy Thomas Thompson?
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   Not Fred Thompson, the other guy in Florida who wants to keep Halo 3.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   Jack Thompson?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   Jack Thompson wants to keep Halo 3 out of Florida.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   Is that what kind of an idiot is he?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   Crackpot.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   I understand some shaky here at Outsider with a Volkswagen just moved into town.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   He's got a town meeting against this.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   He's bought a warehouse just outside the town limits where they're going to play a tournament network.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   Uh, Jack Thompson thinks that he's being made fun of in GTA.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   Yeah, he says there's a Second Amendment lawyer looks just like me.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   He wishes.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:34.920]   Also, according to another study, text messages boosts young voter turnout.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   Researchers ran their tests in the November 2006 election.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.920]   Text reminders were sent to 4,000 young voters.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   And apparently, the study showed that voter turnout rates rose by 4% among the young voters who were texted.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   Not even statistically valid, is it at that level?
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   No, although it does make sense.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   I mean, I qualitatively.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   Yeah, send a text message and vote.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   And by the way, it's a lot cheaper than door-to-door canvassing.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   This wasn't American Idol voting because I could see how that would really have your message.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]   Because you're already right there.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   You know Obama and Clinton are both going to use text messaging.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   You know they are.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   If we could actually vote via text message for the president, I think voter turnout would be huge.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Yeah, press 1 to vote for Clinton.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   Press 2 for Obama.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   I see press talking to Bill Hillary Clinton and John McCain.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've done enough for one day.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   I want to thank our guests, our panelists, I should say.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   They're really not guests.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   They're paid to play.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   Tom Merritt, what we're doing.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   The author of Boiling Point, available at Amazon.com right now.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   And who cares how much Lulu gets?
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   Tom gets some of it.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   You can also catch them on CNET TV at CNETTV.com and every single weekday on Buzz Out Loud
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   with a wonderful Molly Wood.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   So you coming Tuesday?
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   I'm coming Tuesday.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   Alright.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   I'm here Tuesday, 10 AM.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   That's right.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   I won't miss it.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   And I just hope you have some better news than I had.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.920]   There's not much news this week, was there?
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   It's funny.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   Tech news really is cyclic.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.920]   And there are a lot of weeks.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   There's no good news.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   Don't you find that?
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   There are weeks where you're just like, "Wow, maybe I'll just read the user-friendly cartoons."
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   Yeah, I'd love to take those weeks off, but our audience demands that we produce new podcasts
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   every week.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   Oh, there was plenty of news.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   And I think this actually was a good week for us.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920]   That's just because we had such a great panel.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   Andy and Naco also, thank you so much.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   His new site will be coming soon to a browser near you.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   But meanwhile, cwob.com and of course the Chicago Sun times.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   And we see him every week on Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920]   Yes, quite awesome.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   And finally, last but not least, the star of our show, Mr. John C. Devorrok who played
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   not one sound effect during the entire show.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   I'm stunned.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   The man of the future says that man who controls the infinite strength of the star.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   There you go.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   Devorrok.org/plug.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   I got to plug that thing in somehow.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   Yeah, you got to get that plugged into the feed there so you can put it in.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   Yeah, I think it's doable.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   I think we have the technology.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   If somebody has a suggestion, I can take it at devorrok.org/blog.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   When is, are you launching any new shows on Pocha anytime soon?
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Well, yeah, we're working on a couple, but there's nothing--
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   Stealth mode?
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   There's nothing that's been finalized in terms of format.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   Stealth mode.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   Right now, I just do tech five and that's about it.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920]   Cool.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920]   I thank you all for being here.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   We'll see you next week, another Twit.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   This is amazing.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   Is in the can.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   (Music)
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   Round the board.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.920]   I don't know if I buy those rumors.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920]   You buy those rumors?
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   The Draco in the Scorpio.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920]   I like the name Draco.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.920]   Sounds like it's a Malfoy.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920]   Harry Potter.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   I have an editor in Croatia named Drago.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   Drago's a galag.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920]   Drago is a great name.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920]   Does he say Drago or Drogo?
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   I don't know.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   Drago's his first name.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   There was a pitcher, Dick Drago, for the Red Sox back then.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   I'll ask him if it's Drago or Drogo.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920]   I never thought of it.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   It's Drago, but maybe it's his Drogo.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   That's his name is Drago Drogo.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   Nobody would say Drogo.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   That's a good egg.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   I'm stealing that one.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   Drago Drogo.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   What's in the middle of D stands for?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   You don't want to know.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   Drago D.
