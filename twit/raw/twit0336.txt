[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.520]   Oh, man.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   Just back from CES.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.360]   And I've got an exhausted bunch of people.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.280]   Actually, no, you know who's not exhausted?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.240]   Oh, Malek, because he didn't go.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.920]   Oh, Malek from gigaohm.com.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.560]   Nevertheless, there was lots of coverage on gigaohm.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.960]   But you feel like you could just stay home and watch.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.560]   That's right.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.880]   You would say, you know, you don't
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.280]   have to be anywhere to watch news.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.560]   And stuff could be like Kevin and Ryan,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.240]   both for doing a great job.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.720]   And, you know, so I got to chill out in San Francisco.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.080]   You're talking about the gadget blogs and all that, yeah.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.400]   So joining us also, all the way to the left.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   And you'll see why in a moment, Danny Sullivan,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.960]   from searchengineland.com.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.880]   Hi, Danny.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.400]   Hi.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.040]   Good to see you.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.600]   Great to have you.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's on the back of you out there to CES.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080]   You're being surrounded.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   It's the only negative of the skybox that we have,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.880]   or the top of the stairs box, is that you're facing--
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.640]   because we want the cameras to face out
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   so we can see the floor.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120]   So that means you're facing away.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.960]   So all you ever see is the back of somebody's head.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   But hey, that's the price we pay for a great video shot.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   Let's see, who else is here?
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   Tim Stevens from Engadget, who is probably exhausted.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.040]   Engadget was really all over CES this year.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.800]   Thanks, yes.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.920]   I'm first with a stage.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.400]   And that took a lot of planning.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560]   And now let's take a long--
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.120]   Yeah, I'm a little tired, but I'm glad to be here.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.880]   --trailer with 35 editors.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.960]   Amazing coverage.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.280]   And then, yeah, there was the stage in Central Hall.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.720]   Tim Stevens, editor in chief of Engadget.com.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.960]   And finally, somebody-- I don't think
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.720]   who's ever been on Twitter.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.640]   Have you ever been on one?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.080]   I'm not Twitter.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.840]   I've been on a couple of times that never from--
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.560]   Never in studio.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.120]   Never in studio.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.080]   So glad you could come in.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.000]   Larry Maggot from CBS and Larry's World.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.200]   And so nice to see you.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.760]   Larry's been a longtime commentator.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.800]   How many CES's has been for you?
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.240]   If you add up CES's and Commdex's,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.720]   it's probably close to 30.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.400]   Infinite.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   It goes back to the dawn of technology.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It goes back to the '80s.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.920]   Put it down.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   We're going to save our CES coverage
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.480]   for the second half of the show,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   because while we were at CES, huge stuff
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.400]   was happening with Google.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   And it was actually a little frustrating.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.120]   And this is not the first time this has happened.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.480]   I remember CES in 2007 when Apple announced the iPhone.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.040]   We did not want to be at CES.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.440]   We wanted to like flew to San Francisco and flew back.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.400]   Exactly.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.520]   We wanted to be sitting in that audience.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.800]   iPad announcements.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.480]   But this is the first time Google's stolen the thunder.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.960]   And I wonder if Google did this on purpose.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.000]   They turned on social search in effect.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.360]   Danny, what happened?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.800]   Well, Google's had personalized search for--
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.000]   going back to, I'll say, 2006.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.160]   But in 2009, they turned it on for everybody and by default,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.840]   even if you weren't logged in.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   And practically, nobody noticed this.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   It just really got no attention at all.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.040]   So the search, how does it personalize
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.440]   if you're not logged in?
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.280]   So it looks at your previous searches
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.960]   that you've done over a period of, I think, 180 days.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.120]   Buy your cookies.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   Buy your cookies.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.360]   Wow.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.720]   So unless you kept your cookie out,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   even if you're not signed in, it was already
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.680]   personalizing your results.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.920]   I did not know that.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.640]   Well, nobody--
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.960]   What if you were in incognito mode or private browsing mode?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.080]   If you were in incognito mode, it wouldn't do anything
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.400]   because it shouldn't be getting a cookie in that regard.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.560]   So as far as this concerns, you're somebody different.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.400]   And in fact, if you really didn't want personalized results,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.600]   you would have to use incognito mode to make that happen.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.520]   And so they've had that before.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.680]   That was already happening.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.440]   But they have also ramped it up now.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   And they've taken content that you may have shared through Google
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800]   Plus, and they've taken the personalized stuff
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.160]   that they were already doing.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.120]   And they've kind of mixed it all together.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.000]   And they switched that on last week.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.120]   I think it was Tuesday.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.640]   It's already becoming a blur now.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   But basically said, OK, we've got this new thing called
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.080]   Search Plus Your World, which I've heard people either say as
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.080]   SPYW.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.960]   Or I've been calling it Search Plus.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.560]   And Search Plus is more appropriate because--
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   And Twitter screamed about this.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.160]   It featured Google Plus social information, but not Facebook,
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.360]   and not Twitter.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.120]   Yeah, so it does a couple of things.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.240]   You've got, first of all, the ability where you do a search.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   And it says, here are some personalized results.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.880]   And by the way, we can see that you shared this information
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   just out on Google Plus.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.800]   Let me show you right now.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.760]   I'll do a Britney Spears search, something I never do.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.800]   And hit Return.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   And so the results with the person's head next to it,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.920]   those are Search Plus My World's results.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   And what I'm telling you is that you may have shared it,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.280]   or somebody you know may have shared it.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.680]   But for whatever reason, it's giving it a little bit more
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.560]   of a boost than it would have done if you were signed out.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.280]   Although there's a very good chance that if you click on
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.160]   that little globe button next to it to turn off the
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.640]   personal results, she'll probably still be up there.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.240]   Yeah, because this is her site.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.400]   Although it does say that she's in 1.4 million Google Plus
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.160]   circles.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.920]   If I click more by Britney Spears, I'm going to get Google Plus.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.720]   And the second result is from Google Plus.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.320]   See, if you see, it says Vintage Picks by Tumblr.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.560]   I'm pointing at my screen, is that I could point at your screen.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yeah, yeah, right here.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.480]   I'm going to see how it's pointing to a Google Plus post.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.640]   Now, go back up a little bit higher.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.480]   Click on the globe button off to-- there you go.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.720]   So this will be high-person results.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.600]   I see the Tumblr result.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.960]   It turned it right off.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.880]   And it wasn't really a Tumblr result.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.000]   It was a Google Plus result.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.880]   That had been shared by somebody you know.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.920]   And so it caused that to come up a lot higher.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.000]   And that was the personalization that was happening.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.640]   Notice also when I turn off personalization, Twitter is
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.480]   the third result after Britney's site.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.000]   This is what you want, by the way.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   Britney's site, Wikipedia, Twitter.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.400]   That's about right.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.600]   If I go now, Britney's site, Google Plus, Wikipedia,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   images, then Twitter.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.680]   And how they have names on them?
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.200]   Some of those names are images that people you know have
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.480]   shared just with you or with a particular group of people.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   These are from Google Plus.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   That's part of the problem.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.000]   If you had a Flickr account and you shared information
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.520]   on your Flickr account to just a certain group of people,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   the Search Plus world won't find that.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.480]   So it's nice in the sense that there's stuff.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.960]   And look at all the YouTube--
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   And this is the other thing that bugs me.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.040]   As a internet broadcaster, hugely favors YouTube.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840]   I mean, these are all YouTube results.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.280]   If you're not on YouTube, forget it.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.480]   Danny, can I ask you a question?
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.320]   And similarly, if you're not on Google Plus,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.560]   as I'll show you in a moment, you forget it too.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.040]   But go ahead.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.440]   Who is that?
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.240]   Yeah, that's Larry.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.800]   So Danny, so I have a website called safekids.com.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.440]   And I'm always wanting to see how I'm doing when I search
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.960]   for internet safety or online safety.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.000]   Now, if I'm logging to Google, I'm always
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.400]   going to be number one, right?
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.440]   Because it knows me.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.520]   It knows that I go to that site.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.280]   So I wanted to inject a view of how I'm doing.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.760]   What do I do?
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.440]   Do I just hit that globe and turn off the--
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.800]   You have to click the globe button.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   And that'll give you the closest sense that you can have.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.840]   I don't have to log out.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.480]   Does that matter?
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.640]   You don't have to log out the globe button should do it.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.160]   The only other things that will happen that--
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   There are no more normal results.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.200]   The normal results are always personal lines.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.960]   Because even if you're logged out to the--
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.480]   Still personal.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.000]   --to the global--
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.520]   You'd have to use incognito.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.040]   Even if you think incognito mode,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.320]   you're still going to get personal line
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   of results because of your geography and your language.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.760]   So you search for football where you're at.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.520]   Somebody searches for football in the UK.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.000]   They're still going to see different results.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.640]   Even if they were logged out in all of the incognito.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.200]   Are we losing some of the value of Google's original
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.880]   algorithms which are showing us the quote,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.280]   "most important" sites based on some reasonably objective
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.880]   criteria?
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.360]   Potentially and potentially is making it better.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   Yeah, in theory, massaging search results
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.280]   with a social graph gives you more relevant results
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.040]   because people in your social graph picked those results, right?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.360]   Right.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.800]   I mean, if you remember a year ago,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.280]   Google was coming into great fire
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.880]   that somehow the results were irrelevant
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.400]   because they were being overrun by content farms.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.360]   At some point, you've got to come up with other signals
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.680]   to figure out how to rank these things.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.160]   And Google's primary signal has been links,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   looking at how people link.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.480]   Relatively, a few people link to material.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.080]   A lot more people share the material socially.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.760]   If you can tap into the social signals
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.400]   and have them be trusted, theoretically,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.520]   you've got some nice signals and you've got the ability
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.400]   to perhaps have better search results that are coming up.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.800]   Well, what about being self-referential?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.000]   If the old joke people used to say back,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.680]   "You know, I don't know how Nixon got elected.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.520]   "Everybody, I know, voted for George McGovern."
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   This idea that you live in a world.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.520]   In a bubble.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   It can happen.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.800]   And yet, when you do a search,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.280]   and I see this time and time again
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.160]   when you have people who try to compare search engines,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.480]   they do ego searches and they search for themselves.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.000]   And if they don't find themselves,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.480]   they declare the search engine must be--
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.800]   Well, you will now because it's massaging it to be--
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.200]   When I search for me, I get all my--
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Exactly.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   --finesize.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   It should be set by the way.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.640]   It should be set by the way.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.880]   Being has been personalizing for a year now as well.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   You, you, you.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.640]   You go in and you're getting the personalization
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   and you cannot even turn it off as easily
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.960]   as you can do with what Google sort of changed.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.520]   So personalized results are kind of--
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.720]   That's interesting because some of the response to this
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.520]   has been people moving to Bing, but that's not even better.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.920]   Yeah, and they don't realize that Bing is personalizing as well.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's just personalizing using Facebook.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   Now, what is this at top where it says 200 personal results?
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   So that is a way for you to narrow in
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.320]   and just see the stuff that's been shared.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.280]   So if you click on that, you'll see just things
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.520]   that have been shared personally.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.120]   And it'll probably be very heavily on Google+ stuff.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.560]   Yeah, it shows my home address.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.400]   You get to see yourself a lot.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.720]   Now, only I see that, obviously.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.640]   Give me a sample search, Danny, that will--
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.600]   that can maybe show up some of these problems.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.760]   Well, here's a better thing.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.080]   Do a search for music.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.120]   All right.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.680]   All right.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.920]   And this will get to the core of what Twitter is all up
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.800]   and set about.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.040]   Scroll over there to the right-- oh, sorry.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.960]   Go back to the beginning.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.160]   You want to go back to just regular Google
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.520]   because you're still in personalized results.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.920]   So click on the Google logo.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.720]   Click on the Google-- oh, go to the front page.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.880]   That should be set up for you.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.280]   And then do a search for music.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.720]   OK.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.920]   There we go.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.280]   Now, over there, off to the right--
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.760]   People on pages on Google+ related to music, Snoop Dogg
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   and Brittany.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.320]   And note the fun being at, showing up there, by the way.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.560]   Yeah, I think Bing was smart.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.640]   They bought-- obviously bought that search term.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.160]   You've done a search for music.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.920]   And Google is saying-- and they've taken prime real estate
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.240]   where they normally show ads.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.040]   They move those down.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.920]   And they're saying, hey, why don't you
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.400]   follow some people on pages on Google+?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.760]   Now, these are people I already follow.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.600]   Would I see people that I don't follow here?
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.920]   No.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   Well, first of all, you will not see anybody
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.440]   suggested as a possible person or page
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.720]   that you should follow unless they're on Google+.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.520]   So actually, Larry is seeing Brittany and Snoop as well,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.640]   even though you don't follow them.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.000]   Neither one of them, as far as I know.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.520]   They may follow me, I'm down.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.880]   But I am seeing different results.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.360]   You will.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.960]   I'm seeing Yannou music as my top.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.600]   I get Pandora, but--
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.000]   I'm seeing Pandora's three down for me.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.840]   Go ahead.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.360]   But the recommendations?
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   You will get those recommendations,
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   even if you're in incognito mode, and have no Google+ account.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.600]   And where does that come from?
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.920]   Is that from the number of circles?
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.760]   No, it's just Google.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.200]   Well, the exact way that they decide what to show you
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.640]   isn't specific.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.400]   They haven't said--
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.040]   But Brittany and Snoop's record label didn't pay for this.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.880]   This was--
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.560]   No.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.960]   But Brittany and Snoop are there because they're on Google+.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.760]   Yeah, and they have a lot of followers.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.480]   1.4 and 2.1.2 million.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.560]   And Katy Perry is not there because she is not on Google+.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.080]   Wow.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.840]   And Lady Gaga, who I don't think is on Google+,
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.880]   is not showing up there.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   Actually, Lady Gaga is.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.800]   Even though they as musicians are among the most
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.360]   followed people over on Facebook.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.080]   That's interesting.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.360]   So what's happening on that side of the page is Google saying,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.560]   hey, here are some people to follow because they're on Google+.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.920]   Not, here are some people to follow socially
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.840]   because we are a search engine designed to show you
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.800]   relevant stuff from across the web.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   You're interested in following people socially.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.160]   So we have looked at people who are on Facebook and on Twitter
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.320]   and on Google+.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.520]   To try to show you some people that may be adventurous.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.120]   You're right, Lady Gaga is not on Google+.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   So in other words, Google is using its huge cloud
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.320]   in the search market to incentivize everybody.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.800]   If you're Lady Gaga and you're not on Google+,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.880]   you're crazy.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.240]   You ought to get on Google+.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.120]   And boy, if I were Twitter, I'd be furious about that.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.080]   Can I ask Danny a question?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.280]   So this reminds me of back in the day when Microsoft launched
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.080]   the Internet Explorer and basically forced all searches
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.240]   and all traffic to go through the Internet Explorer.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.120]   Do you see a similarity?
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.480]   And do you really think that there
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.920]   is a case for the US government Department of Justice
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.440]   to go after Google on this issue?
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.800]   I mean, your example kind of shows that technically they're
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.200]   not doing anything wrong.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.680]   But when you look at it, they are doing something
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.720]   doesn't add up when you look at that search and the music.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.400]   I don't know what--
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.560]   I mean, so they're currently being investigated.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.040]   Most people say-- the people who are upset with them
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.960]   will say things like, you're promoting your own shopping
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.720]   search engine.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.920]   And most of those arguments have been kind of laughable
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.760]   because they're a shopping search engine in turn
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.480]   simply promotes other businesses who aren't charged to be in it.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.600]   Well, and on music--
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.720]   And I don't know if that's because music is so high profile.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.240]   But I get a Bing ad.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.000]   I get Pandora.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.360]   And I get Yahoo music before I get Google music on YouTube.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.800]   But you're seeing tailored results.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.480]   I mean, that might change up a bit.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.160]   But you're right.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.560]   In that main column, they're showing you
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.720]   a diversity of results from across the web.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.200]   And a really good example is when you do a search on Google
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.080]   and they show you video results, you
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.840]   see lots and lots of YouTube stuff.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.120]   But technically, they are showing you stuff
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   from Google Video, which concludes things beyond YouTube.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.600]   But this is different.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.920]   This is really the case where Google has said,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.080]   we are going to give one of our products
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.760]   preferential service.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   We are not going to try to show search results for people
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.000]   who are on the web socially and give you
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   an inclusive experience.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.600]   We're going to just give you the best of Google+,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.040]   and we are going to integrate it so tightly into Google Search
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.720]   that if you are a person or an artist or anybody who
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.200]   wants to be there, you had better open up a Google+ account.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.600]   And let's show you the last thing what happens.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.160]   After you open up that Google+ account,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.320]   go do a search now and just start typing in--
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   type in Brittany.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   Just do it slowly.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.680]   OK.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.640]   V-R-I-T-N.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.120]   There.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.080]   Stop.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.000]   Look at the bottom.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.120]   See how Brittany's got her face showing up there?
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.960]   Oh, there's a cow on Google+.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.520]   And Google is.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.040]   And if you select it, it's going to take you
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.280]   to her Google+ profile.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.200]   Her Google+ profile is going to fill the entire page.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.360]   Wow.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.120]   Now, Google could have said, you know what?
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.200]   We think people should have these kind of search
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.040]   suggestions that are showing up there.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.920]   And so you can register your account
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.360]   so that when people type, it goes directly to your--
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.800]   like, Leah, right?
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.040]   Perhaps--
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.480]   Look at that.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.840]   I just typed Leah on the very first result.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.280]   Now, this is because it's me, though.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.640]   What if I go global?
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.440]   It's just because of you.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.800]   But perhaps you might have preferred that to show up.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.200]   And people get a link that takes you directly to your website.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   To my blog.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.760]   Not to Google+.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.720]   Or perhaps you might have wanted that to come up.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.000]   And you said, you know what?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   Most of my activity is over on Facebook.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.040]   I wanted to go there.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.320]   You can't do that.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   It's only Google+ that's going to be promoted in that kind of way.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.760]   So to go back to what you said, in the past,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.320]   most of these arguments I thought,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.560]   if you take a critical look at them,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.600]   the antitrust arguments start to fall apart.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.280]   It's kind of like saying, hey, I'm really upset that when I
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.560]   read the Wall Street Journal, I don't get the New York Times
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.800]   sports section, right?
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.240]   The coverage is still going to be inclusive.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.720]   It just--
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   But that's my problem.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.920]   Now, in that case, you've got content providers.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   And of course, one content provider
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   is not going to promote another.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.760]   That's the question here.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   Is Google a content company or a search company?
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.720]   And by intermingling the two, I think
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.520]   that is a serious problem.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.200]   And this is the most serious interviewingling they've had.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.640]   I've made a few cases.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.840]   There are a few cases where Google is both a destination,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.800]   where you go to, and a search company where you depart from.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.640]   And YouTube has been one example of that.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.080]   Google Books has been another.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.760]   They've had Blog and a few other things.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.000]   But Google Plus is something that they're turning into a major
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.160]   destination.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.660]   And--
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.240]   So somebody in the chatroom said, well, I don't see the
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.800]   problem as Facebook does this.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.920]   But that's the point.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.040]   This is Google.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.200]   Google isn't Facebook.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.560]   And the problem comes into the fact that if you're a dominant
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.280]   player in an industry, you may have to do more than what the
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.640]   less dominant players do.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.680]   But Google--
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.360]   And this is what Eric Schmidt said when he was
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.800]   testifying in September, that he recognized that they were
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.760]   a dominant player, and that they might have to do that, and
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.680]   that he agreed that they would.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.080]   But as a search company, they may not be able to preference
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.880]   their Google Plus network more than other networks.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.440]   Facebook, they're not a search company, so they don't have to.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.720]   However, Facebook might find themselves in another
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.600]   situation down the line.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.360]   Somebody could say to Facebook, hey, you are not allowing
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.520]   Google to have access to your data.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.400]   And yet you will allow that data, or you'll even allow your
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.360]   users to export their email addresses out to Yahoo and
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.120]   Microsoft.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.280]   Therefore, that is unfair.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.600]   You're abusing your dominant position.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.400]   You've got to do the same.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.280]   So they may pace it down the line.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.240]   It seems to me that there wouldn't be the issue if there
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.960]   were no Google Plus, if there were no YouTube, if Google
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.320]   were a pure search company, this wouldn't be a problem.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.160]   If they were incorporating Twitter and Facebook--
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.120]   in fact, why don't they incorporate Twitter and Facebook?
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.480]   And that's where this would have not been such a
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.600]   big issue if they had rolled out not a people and places on
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.200]   Google Plus area.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   But instead, they just rolled out people and places from
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.680]   across the country.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.840]   It would have been wonderful, right?
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.880]   You can go right now and say, hey, I want to follow some
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.400]   celebrities, where are their accounts?
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:49.920]   Exactly.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.480]   And there are small companies that do that.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.240]   And we'll tell you, hey, Brittany, spirit, she's on this,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   she's on that.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.160]   And you can follow her there.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.400]   And Google could have done the same.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.200]   And their Google Plus network could have been as part of
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.440]   this overall whole, which would have been fitting into the
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.080]   search engine model they've all done along.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.440]   Danny, didn't they used to have a deal with Twitter that
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.320]   expired?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   They used to have Twitter results.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.880]   They did.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.800]   And they still do.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.280]   And this is where you get some more confusion that comes
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.720]   into play.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   In fact, I'll probably write up a whole fact about this.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.560]   So they wanted to deal with Facebook and they couldn't.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.880]   And so one of their arguments is, well, we don't have
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.640]   Facebook's data.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.880]   We couldn't even possibly use this stuff.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   We couldn't do it if we wanted to.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.000]   And then they had a deal with Twitter where they were
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.800]   getting the full fire hose of all the tweets that are being
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   put out there.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.920]   And it gave them a good idea.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.800]   And that's why they built their whole real-time search
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.200]   around that and that expired about a year ago.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.520]   The problem is what they're doing where they're showing you
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.480]   like suggested celebrities to follow, they know what
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.080]   Britney Spears' Facebook account is and her Twitter
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.640]   account is.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.160]   And they know it really easily because if you go to
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.400]   Britney's Google+ page, you click on it out.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.160]   You click on it out.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.720]   She has listed all her other products.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.080]   As have I.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.640]   And on top of that, they've even verified it.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.760]   So they've got a perfectly good database that they
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.120]   could take into.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:04.960]   But they didn't.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.840]   Now, here's a weird thing.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.120]   Now, this happens with people.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.360]   But I just did a brand, Coca-Cola.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.720]   And I know Coca-Cola has a big Google+ page.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.000]   I didn't get it.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.840]   Now, but try this.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.200]   Do a search for cars.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.400]   Because this is where it certainly turns into a marketing
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.640]   thing that everybody will understand.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.200]   Just do a regular search for cars.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.560]   And it has returned.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.160]   Oh, boy.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.720]   Look at this.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   People and pages are Google+--
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.160]   Oops.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.640]   I've hovered over something to do this.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.680]   You want to be number one for cars on Google?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.560]   Have a big--
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.880]   Have a Google+ page.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.400]   All you need is 5,920 people.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   And you'll be number one.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.920]   Holy cow.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.120]   Holy cow.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.680]   Now, in fair way, there is a link.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.960]   Learn how you could appear here, too.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.600]   Yes.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.120]   Think on it.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.400]   It'll be like, join Google+.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.120]   Oh, my god.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.640]   You imagine if it was like, learn
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.080]   how to be in Google search results.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.040]   And you clicked on a link.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.080]   And instead of it being like, submit your URL
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.240]   or have a website, it was open up a Google account.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   That's the only--
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   I mean--
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.920]   You know, maybe they can make an argument that it's--
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.800]   maybe they can say, look, this is--
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.040]   it doesn't feel right.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.720]   It doesn't pass the smell test.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.640]   Can you argue that it's because it's
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.880]   the right side of the page.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.120]   That's kind of advertising real estate
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.560]   as opposed to the middle column, which
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.360]   is editorial real estate.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.160]   So I think it's really, really complicated there
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.080]   because the FTC actually has guidelines
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.600]   that they did about 10 years ago that said,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.880]   if you have promoted content, it's not good.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   But it's to support yourself.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.320]   You just want to make it clear.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.800]   So that's a really gray area.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.000]   Are you being shown editorial search results?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   Are you being shown something promoted?
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.400]   Is that area advertising?
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.720]   It's not advertising because they haven't labeled it
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.880]   as they're required to do to follow those guidelines.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.440]   So I think Google would argue that it's not really just
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.800]   search results.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.520]   The searcher wouldn't expect that they're
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.680]   getting some kind of inclusive thing necessarily.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.920]   And even if they did, they are saying,
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.440]   these are Google+ things.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.960]   But I think the bigger question just
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.400]   goes back to Google itself.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.840]   It just doesn't feel very googly, right?
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.240]   Google's really all been into it.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.680]   We always want to include everything.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.960]   We want to do the best we can.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.800]   And we want to have inclusive results.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.720]   We don't want to have just one kind of thing happening.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.200]   And yet they've rolled out something
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.440]   that really is favoring Google+ in a huge way.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.640]   That's prime real estate being handed over.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.840]   And if you do a search and you decide
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.360]   that you want to show people recommendations for people
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.000]   to follow socially about music or about cars or about technology,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.240]   then you really ought to show the best people
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.560]   from the best social networks wherever
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.400]   those social networks are, not just whoever it is.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.520]   It just happened to use Google+.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.280]   And that's the core of it to me that they've really stumbled on.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   Only have any thoughts on that?
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.720]   No, I'm just listening to this with fascination with--
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.320]   It is fascinating.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   But so I just wonder if the whole idea of do no evil
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.640]   is pretty much done as far as people can speak that.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.720]   Now it's grab all the loot you can.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.680]   I think it's become do lots of social.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.320]   And if you're fighting evil, then it's OK.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.760]   I mean, I've struggled with this.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.320]   And part of the mindset that I wonder if Google's looking--
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.280]   there's some background to all this, right?
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.840]   Google has been extremely paranoid
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.040]   that important data has been locked up,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.080]   especially behind Facebook.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.920]   And to be fair, Facebook has done some really weird things.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.960]   Like they said they cut a deal with Microsoft
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.120]   to share their social information with Microsoft.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.200]   They didn't and wouldn't cut one with Google.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.760]   We don't know exactly why, but there
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.280]   seemed to be some argument over whether or not
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.480]   you could pull back certain personal information
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   and get it removed or whatever.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.800]   But the stated answer from Zuckerberg was, well,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.360]   we think if we work with an underdog,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   they'll do a better job.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.480]   OK, right.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.560]   But they never-- they wouldn't do the deal with Google.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.680]   They're seeing the same thing happening with Twitter,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.120]   and they felt like I guess they couldn't get the same sort of data.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.840]   So in the end, it's like, all right,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.720]   we are paranoid, important information that belongs, if you
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.880]   will, to the users themselves is difficult for those users
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.640]   to get out.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.800]   Like I said--
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.760]   Well, it's an excellent--
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.800]   It's an excellent point.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.480]   --you go to Facebook, you cannot
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.920]   export the email addresses of all your friends to Google.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.880]   Although you can do that to Microsoft and Yahoo.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.680]   So I think that they may be feeling like, you know what?
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.160]   Maybe this is a little evil, but we're pushing back
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.320]   against a further evil.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.240]   And I think it's an excellent point.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.040]   I mean, I've made this point about both Twitter and Facebook.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.720]   They are silos.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.920]   And people are unaware of what they're doing,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.400]   because they're pumping all this information into these silos.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.080]   And both Twitter and Facebook are working as hard as they can
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.400]   to capitalize on this information and ultimately
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.120]   keep it to themselves.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.880]   And Google obviously saw a threat here,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.200]   because Facebook could do social search
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.040]   and has all this social graph information.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.240]   So Google had to respond.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.160]   Do you feel like Google--
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.520]   I mean, also, I'm sure Google is aware of the fact
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   that this is going to intensify government scrutiny.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   They're already under investigation.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.840]   This is just going to intensify.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.240]   Do you think that they just said, well,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.160]   we've got to bite the bullet.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.480]   We're going to take the chance and see what happens.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.080]   Sorry, I didn't catch that last part.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.600]   Well, I'm just wondering if the Google executives knowing
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.440]   that this is going to piss the government off,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.960]   still said, well, we have to do it.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:30.600]   I think that the Google executives probably
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.120]   thought they had a justification for everything
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.880]   that they were doing.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.400]   Oh, I'm sure they did.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.280]   I don't think Google did anything that they didn't feel
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.520]   like they couldn't rationalize.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   I think they felt like, oh, this is fine.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.920]   We're not doing anything wrong.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.840]   We're matching up what we should be doing,
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.040]   and that is all OK.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.400]   So like I said, I don't think they do anything
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.640]   that they don't think that they can't rationalize.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.240]   So Danny, I wouldn't be surprised if they thought, well,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.880]   maybe this is something we can do that will cause--
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.560]   Did you just do that blog post?
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.040]   I did it yesterday.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.800]   What's that?
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.160]   Because Larry Meghan just did a blog post.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.080]   How and why did Turnoff Googled's personalized search
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.600]   result?
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.920]   It just has a step-by-step.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.800]   I didn't do it quite yet.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.320]   Everybody should know this.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.640]   Larry's World.com, that's a good place to find that out.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.960]   Anybody should-- if you need step-by-step instructions
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   on how to turn it off, you'll find it at Larry's World.com.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.080]   And I guess the point is you can turn it off.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.400]   Absolutely.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.520]   You can turn it off-- not just--
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.880]   you can turn it off on a search-by-search basis,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.120]   or you can turn it off completely.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.560]   But I'm not so much worried about me and whether what I'm seeing.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.040]   I'm more worried about the fact that Google's using its immense
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.840]   clout in search to promote Google properties and Google content.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's the thing that's always worried
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.480]   means what worries me about YouTube.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.680]   As a competitor in effect to YouTube,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.480]   because we're doing our own content that isn't on YouTube,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.000]   I would like that to have a parody
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.560]   if you search for a term like SOPA that
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.520]   "twit content as parody with YouTube content," it clearly does not.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.800]   And so I think that this is a problem.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.000]   And we don't know why it doesn't.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.960]   Is it because we don't have active Google+ followers?
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.520]   Is it because we really truly aren't as good as YouTube?
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.080]   But it muddies the waters would be my--
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.000]   Well, one difficulty with YouTube
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.800]   is that because they have so much content out there,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.320]   that's one thing where Google will often say, well,
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.640]   the reason you see so much of it is
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.480]   because there just is so much content that's happening.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.640]   But--
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.080]   People are saying, well, you use your clout to promote "twit,"
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.200]   but my point is a search engine should be above that.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.680]   You need a pure search engine.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.240]   If a search engine is promoting its own business interests,
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.840]   then it's not a pure search engine.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.800]   It's not giving you the best search results.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.680]   It's giving you the best search results
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.400]   based on my business interest.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.960]   That's not what people want.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.160]   Exactly.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.600]   And that's really--
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.160]   I've seen a number of people say this,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.520]   like, well, what's wrong with Google promoting itself?
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.280]   And that is where it falls into place.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.440]   Google has built its business and built its--
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.280]   if you want morality around the idea that they should point
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.960]   to the best content from across the web,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.800]   not just for their own content.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.080]   There's confusion where people will then say,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.160]   but they point to Google Shopping as if, well,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.040]   that's a long time thing over them favoring themselves.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.960]   Google Shopping is simply a part of Google search.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.080]   And it's designed to point to the best content
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.920]   from across the web.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.560]   You don't go to Google Shopping,
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.320]   and then just get stuck on Google.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.120]   You get pointed out to merchants.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.080]   But this is different.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.880]   This is really a case of Google going through and saying,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.840]   maybe there are better things we could do.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.600]   Maybe there are stuff that we could
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.280]   gather about Facebook signals or Twitter signals,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.880]   but we're just going to use the Google signals that
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.920]   are out there and go with it.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.600]   What about the privacy implications?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.360]   Now, if I post a picture of me, for example, on Google+,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.280]   I have tremendous control over who can see that.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   I have privacy tools.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.640]   I can make it public just to buy circles.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.400]   But now people are seeing it on search.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.320]   And true, the only people who are seeing it
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.520]   are the ones that I've posted at you.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.840]   But there's a contextual thing.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.320]   If I post something on Google+, and it's seen on Google+,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.000]   does that look and feel a little different
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.960]   if that same information comes up on a search?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.760]   Possibly.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.880]   I mean, I think the harder thing is that people--
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   this is like the first time for ages.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.040]   We used to have desktop search.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.480]   They got blended with irregular search.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.920]   But it's the first time for ages where we've
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.720]   had this private or limited shared information that's
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.880]   showing up within what looks like regular search results.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   And I don't think it's so much that people did the sharing
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   and thought, oh, I would have written that differently
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.640]   if I thought it would show up in search for somebody else.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.760]   I think there are two different things that happen--
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.800]   that people have shared information
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.640]   and then forget about it and don't
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.680]   realize it may turn up again in a way
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.960]   that they thought it was forgotten.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.680]   And Facebook timelines like this, right?
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.240]   If you haven't seen it, it's just great.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   The Google search plus your world video
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.480]   where Hitler discovers it.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.400]   I love it.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   I love it.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.080]   And it's fantastic.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.480]   I would play it, but there's a lot of profanity in it.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.120]   Had to show up.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.280]   You did a great job with it.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.640]   And there's one scene where in the hallway,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.680]   they're all reacting and Hitler is very upset.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.240]   And this woman comes up and taps another woman
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.720]   on their shoulders.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.200]   She goes, oh, by the way, that picture you
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.440]   at the frat party is up on your Facebook timeline.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   OK.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   But that's what timeline did.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.360]   It was like you shared all this information.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.680]   You might have thought, oh, yeah,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   you kind of forgot about it.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.880]   And all of a sudden, it was all organized again.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.360]   Put out on your timeline and people might have thought, oh,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.960]   I didn't even remember it was out there.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.880]   I want to get rid of that.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.160]   And so it wasn't that it wasn't visible.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   It was just that it was made re-visible, if you will.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.360]   I think there's something about a contextual place.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.560]   When you find something out of context,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.960]   it could have a different meaning
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.600]   than the context in which it was presented.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.760]   And again, they're not violating your privacy.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.880]   It's just the way in which they're presenting it
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.400]   may be different than the way you perceived you were posting it.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.440]   Well, exactly.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.880]   When you posted something about, hey, check out my new car,
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.600]   you didn't perceive, necessarily,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.760]   that when somebody did a search for cars,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.640]   your new car was going to show up in their search results,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.400]   even though you did the permission to get it.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.160]   And then you get into the issue where you probably really
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.280]   didn't think that maybe they thought that was cool,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.040]   and then they re-shared it without thinking about it
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.640]   being limited privately.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.880]   And they shared it out to the world,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.680]   and suddenly there's your car with your license plate
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.760]   sitting out there.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.360]   It's interesting because--
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.640]   I'm drunk.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.440]   That takes you being so drunk, so--
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   It's interesting because almost everybody in our chat
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.520]   is defending Google and says, hey, it's Google, it's a business.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.120]   They can promote their own business.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.400]   What's the problem with that?
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.800]   And you can go somewhere else.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.840]   Is there anyone else you can go?
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.120]   You can go somewhere else.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.640]   The problem with it is, first of all,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.600]   it's not what Google itself says it's supposed to be doing.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.320]   So if you've got a problem with anything
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.040]   and you love Google, you really ought to ask why Google is not
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.280]   doing what Google says it's supposed to be doing,
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   which is providing the best search results from across the web.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.600]   Best could depend on what you mean by best, I guess.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.040]   Well, I'll show you.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   Do a search for Facebook.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.360]   Do a search on Google for Facebook, and it will--
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.280]   Let's see what we get here.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:32:59.800]   Face--
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.960]   Google Pathways out there can go out as they want.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.160]   So what do you think you're going to see Google fanboys
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.800]   when I search for Facebook?
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.960]   I get Facebook.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.280]   Were they recommending over there on the right hand side
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   of the page?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.000]   Mark Zuckerberg on Google+,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.560]   Hey, follow Mark Zuckerberg on Google+,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.840]   bear in mind, this is some of the most valuable real estate
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.440]   from search results that Google has.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.880]   Go ahead and click on Mark Zuckerberg
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.720]   and show me what Google is recommending
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.520]   out of all the possible things about Mark Zuckerberg
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.600]   that it could put up there.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.760]   An empty page on Google+, is it possible that there is any place
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.800]   else that Mark Zuckerberg is active socially?
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.680]   He's here to look at the more than nothing.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.920]   And the answer is, of course, Facebook.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.160]   That's what's wrong with this.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.640]   That is not relevant.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.120]   And Google's job as a search engine is to be relevant.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.080]   So I've defended Google time and time again.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.000]   Somebody says, Eric says, hey, they recommended Facebook,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.600]   Gugham, you're choosing to look at the right pain.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.600]   Don't use the look.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.120]   It is Google's search real estate that they are devoting
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.040]   there that they go through--
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.840]   It's effectively an ad.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.640]   I think that's what the FTC is going to say.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.560]   If you do this, you need to say this is an ad.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.240]   The FTC does not say as show up on the right-hand side
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.360]   of the page.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.960]   That's not a definition.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.640]   No, no, they need to put ad.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.880]   They need to be possibly--
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.560]   you know, possibly they need to put out there.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.120]   And if they did put an ad out there,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.920]   this would be less of an argument.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.080]   Because that's what it is.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.840]   Even without the arguments over what the FTC requires,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.480]   it's not the right user experience.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.800]   It is not a search engine you expect Google, the leader
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.760]   in search engines, to have provided.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   And it does not matter whether or not Facebook does it,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.080]   or Twitter does it, or Bing does it.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.640]   It's Google doing it.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.960]   And Google should be doing what Google is supposed
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.920]   to be doing best.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.800]   Hey, but if the world has changed now,
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.040]   and Google has decided maybe that's part of the answer,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.160]   that screw it.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   Everybody else is doing it.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.120]   We're in too.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.920]   Then there we go.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.640]   But it makes the world a sadder place.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.080]   I'm sad.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.520]   We're going to-- Danny Sullivan's here.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.880]   There is another Google story I want to talk about before we
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.360]   move on to CES.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.320]   Google Kenya is being accused of scouring a rivals database.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.560]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.760]   But before we do, I want to mention our great friends
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.400]   at Citrix who make a product called Go to My PC that
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.040]   is the ultimate in remote access.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.640]   And I want you to take a look at it.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.720]   Absolutely free.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.120]   Picture this.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   You're on your way home.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.600]   You've been on a long hard day at work.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.320]   You're just so glad to be heading home.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.920]   And then you check your phone or you get a text that says,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.120]   we got-- there's something that needs your media attention.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.280]   And you can go back to the office and fix it.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.120]   And you're saying, oh, no, no, please.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.760]   No.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.160]   See, if you had Go to My PC installed on the office computer,
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.040]   all you'd say is no problem.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   You'd pull over.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.840]   Open-- I notice I said that.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.760]   Don't keep driving.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.960]   You pull over.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.680]   You open.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.040]   You're going to My PC app on your iPhone.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.240]   And now you're accessing.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.320]   Yes, your iPhone.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.880]   You're accessing your office computer.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.000]   And you can get that file and send it off to the person who
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.800]   needs it.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.440]   You can work.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.520]   You can send and receive email.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.000]   You could take care of last minute requests.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.880]   Not just on the road.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.920]   Anywhere you can get online with Go to My PC.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.200]   Edit PowerPoint, update spreadsheets.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.480]   Work on any file right from your iPhone and your iPad
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.680]   and from Android phones and from your desktop and from your laptop.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.560]   Go to MyPC.com.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.680]   It's really a great solution.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.760]   I want you to visit the website.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.600]   Go to MyPC.com.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.720]   Click the try it free button.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.840]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.000]   You can try this free for 30 days.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.120]   The key on this-- there are many remote access solutions.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.600]   Here's the point of all of this.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.280]   It's fast.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.720]   There's nothing faster out there.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.080]   These guys know the guts of Windows better than anybody.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.760]   And Mac too.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.600]   It's secure, 128-bit SSL at all times.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.040]   You never have to worry.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.960]   It's easy to install.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.280]   Keeps itself up to date automatically.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.920]   There's never been a security flaw.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.560]   This thing is the bomb.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.280]   I want you to try it.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.080]   Go to MyPC.com.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.760]   Click the try it free button.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.920]   The offer code is TWIT.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   And now, go wherever you want.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.880]   Enjoy life.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.120]   Don't worry.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.360]   You can get things done automatically.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.720]   We thank Citrix for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.000]   Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.com.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.200]   Poor Tim Stevens.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.280]   We're going to get to you in a bit.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.240]   We'll talk about gadgets.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   I've seen your patience, mate.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.640]   I've got plenty of gadgets to talk about, don't we?
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.360]   You don't have anything to say about this Google thing,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.040]   apparently.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   I guess my big concern--
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.680]   thank you so much with the trade concerns.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.400]   It's more about the legitimacy of Search.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   If all my friends share or plus one on a page
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.920]   with bogus information on it, does that mean
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   that'll be the first search result?
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.600]   I mean, think of all the four words and crazy conspiracy
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.240]   theories that your friends send you.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   If all that shows up on Google, does that mean that'll
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.680]   be the number one search result for those sorts of things?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.280]   Well, ironically, this is designed to fight spam
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.120]   and it could open the door to the worst spam ever.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.520]   If all that spam's coming right from your friends,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.560]   then it's going to bubble right up to the top of your Google
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.880]   search results.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.120]   Yeah, it gives spam more clout.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.240]   All right, so here's--
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.120]   go ahead.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.040]   The answer to that, by the way, Google
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.640]   would be is that if your friends are spamming,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.480]   you'll probably stop being friends with them.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.840]   That's true.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.560]   But there's spam and spam.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.760]   So that stupid squid and Hitler refers to that.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.520]   That stupid squid is going to bubble up with its stupid waving
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.560]   arms to the top of my research results every time.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.800]   And that's the problem is that--
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.880]   and I have friends who share bad content sometimes.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   I'm not going to lose them as friends.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.360]   Maybe I should.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.440]   Maybe I should get better friends.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.080]   Or I'll say opinionated content.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.320]   If you're all of your friends that are of like mind,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.920]   and that's typical, we can do--
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.760]   Democrat's hangover.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Democrat's--
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.040]   All my friends voted for my govern.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.520]   Exactly.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.880]   If all your friends that way, you're
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.960]   not going to get a good view of the world.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.520]   If your view is just of your friends,
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.840]   that's what bothers me.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   I don't want to--
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.560]   Well, that's Elliot Parriser's filter bubble issue.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.120]   Which, I mean--
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.160]   But that's where-- I mean, life is like that.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.960]   If you only read the national review--
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.720]   And I mean, people do that anyway.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.840]   If I use MSNBC--
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.120]   You're much more likely to get variety on the internet,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.840]   regardless of that filter bubble than anything else.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.200]   It's just that if I want to watch Fox do the MSNBC,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.040]   I know I'm getting results, or I'm getting content that's
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.840]   biased by a political out view.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   Maybe you did.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.080]   I don't expect that in Google.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.400]   Well, I think--
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:25.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.200]   I think a lot of people watch those channels
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   believe they're getting fair and balanced.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.840]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.960]   That's the whole other show, Leo.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.200]   Murdoch, are you listening to your--
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.680]   So Kenya, let's talk about Kenya.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.080]   I don't-- what do you make of this, Danny?
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.560]   Mocality, which is a Kenyan startup,
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.360]   it has-- it's an online business directory
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.760]   says that Google Kenya knowingly and systematically
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.600]   accessed its database to steal its customers.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.080]   It discovered the behavior after monitoring internet traffic
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.680]   and setting up a sting operation.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.960]   They say they caught Google in the act.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.600]   Google said they told the next web, well,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.440]   we're aware that a company in Kenya
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.800]   has accused us of using some of their publicly available
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.880]   customer data without permission,
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.680]   and we're investigating.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.360]   They came back later and they said, yeah, we're--
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.840]   there were-- we're mortified.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.360]   They did it.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   They said they-- yeah, we've looked into it more.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.920]   We're mortified about what happened,
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.000]   and we're investigating it even further.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.360]   Is it a rogue employee in Kenya,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.680]   or is this something systematic?
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.880]   It probably is some rogue employees,
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.000]   but that probably doesn't let them off the hook.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Right.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.680]   Because at some point, how often-- or, you know,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.160]   to what-- remember, the year started out with--
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.240]   this has not been a good month for Google.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.960]   The month started out with Google
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.720]   having to penalize its official Chrome page,
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.400]   because it was involved in a link buying campaign.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.360]   Right.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.960]   They had a-- they were going to do a promotion for Chrome.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.280]   They went out there.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.880]   They had a third party firm that they
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.040]   worked with who, in turn, engaged another third party
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.080]   term, who, in turn, got a bunch of mummy
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.920]   walkers to start linking over to this post,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.280]   and they decided that technically that was sponsored
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   post that weren't disclosed.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.520]   Therefore, they had to penalize their own Chrome page.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.400]   That was rogue employee, rogue situation number one.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.800]   Now we're like rogue situation number two.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   Do I-- no, I don't think people at Google Mountain View
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.160]   ever would have thought, you know what we should do?
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.040]   This is a great idea.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.440]   Let's go on and go through another rival business database,
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.760]   call them up, tell the customers that we're from Google,
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.680]   we're working with the other company,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.080]   and they should come over to our new system.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   I think they would be mortified and horrified
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.680]   that that happened.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.080]   And yet it did.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.920]   And it's going to fall right down on them.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.080]   And it's going to be used by their critics to say, aha,
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.880]   see, this is just another sign of Google's
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.320]   institutional activities to try to wipe out everything
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.000]   until they own the entire interwebs.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.400]   It's a blot on their scutcheon, if nothing else.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.680]   I think the whole company, the way I see Google,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   is just it's growing so fast, and it's actually
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.360]   losing a grip on what it's all about.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.600]   And I think that is a bigger problem
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.960]   they need to confront with.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.160]   These small things which are happening in the first two
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.360]   weeks, and we've had three big issues on Google,
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.400]   that's a sign of a company which is kind of coming apart,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.120]   and it doesn't have a full control over where it's going.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.480]   I think whenever I see Google, I see Google going further
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.680]   and further away from its own core mission.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.960]   And I think when companies do that,
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.440]   they do unnatural things.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:51.120]   And unnatural things are things like scraping somebody's data,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.480]   or buying link campaigns.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.400]   And so basically, this is the processes that are not there.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.120]   The company just doesn't have the processes to see and expand
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.840]   its thought process and its culture into newcomers
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.280]   and new employees.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.320]   I think that's a bigger issue for Google.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.680]   We can look at things in one small isolation and say,
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.080]   OK, this is a problem.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.040]   This is a problem.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.320]   But it has been going on for a very long time.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:21.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.880]   What do you think, Danny?
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.640]   I agree.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.320]   I think that they have been running very, very hard,
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.640]   and especially over this past year where Larry Page has
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.920]   taken over as CEO.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.760]   And we had this declaration that, hey, everything's
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.720]   got to be social.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.080]   And as John Patel reminded yesterday,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.160]   if you start linking everything to social and that's
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.240]   being tied to your paycheck, this might
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.280]   be part of the consequence of it.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.040]   That's a good point.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.960]   They really do incentivize people to do this.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.200]   And it's like that type of thing, plus that they are so big,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.160]   that you want them to have an operational pause at this point.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.480]   And which is something they actually did a few years ago.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.640]   They had so many products that said,
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.080]   we're putting everything on hold until we kind of get our heads
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.840]   figured out and see what we're going to be going.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.120]   And yeah, I agree.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.840]   I feel like that they may be in that situation
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   where there's just too many different moving parts,
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.120]   too many different things going on, too many things
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.760]   that perhaps they're chasing rather than leading on.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.600]   We've got to get this.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.480]   We've got to solve that.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   And especially the social aspect, it just
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.920]   feels like it's being shoved at you so much when you don't
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.880]   necessarily want or didn't ask for Google+ to be in your search
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.120]   results or Google+ to be in your reader thing or Google+
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.520]   to be over here or there.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.040]   I know you have to run, Danny, I want to thank you so much
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.720]   for taking the time because this is, I think,
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.040]   a big topic that we kind of didn't cover
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.720]   because we were at CES and covering that kind of full time.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.840]   And I think, in fact, a lot of the tech press came back.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.480]   I know Scobel said, I've got to try this,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.000]   because he hadn't been able to-- none of us
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.840]   have been able to try it.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.960]   We've been busy doing other stuff.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.760]   There's plenty of CES stuff to keep everybody busy.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.920]   Back to more fun gadget news.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   Back to TV is it just a moment.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.520]   Thank you, Danny.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.920]   Danny Sullivan is a search engine in the end.com.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.120]   Really the best coverage of this kind of stuff constantly.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.240]   We didn't even get to a previous post, which I think
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.880]   is really an interesting post to read about how Google is
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.360]   really changing the world for SEO by restricting
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.520]   the amount of information SEOs can get about who links to you.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.800]   This used to be something that was a big deal.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.240]   That's what the story was.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.800]   I thought that was going to explode this week.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   I know.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.560]   Google had taken away all the keyword data,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.000]   said it was due to privacy, and then they
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.880]   rolled this thing out and you realized it has even
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.520]   left to do with privacy than you thought.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   Right.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.640]   Other things happened.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.240]   Well, I guess all we can say is it's the day we realized
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.600]   Google was a for-profit business.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.160]   Shocking.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:50.800]   Shocking.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.320]   Oh, my god.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.840]   I had no idea.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.440]   Thank you, Danny.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.520]   It was Google that morning.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:54.960]   Hey, Eric.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.080]   Great to talk to you.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.720]   Danny Sullivan, search engine land.com to follow more of this.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.040]   We are going to get to-- actually, you know,
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.320]   I guess we'll do CES next, because I want to talk about CES.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.760]   But then there's also Wednesday is SOPA Day.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.200]   And the White House announced that, well, we would never
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   sign a bill like this.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.680]   Of course, they've said before we will never sign a bill like
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:15.840]   this.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.800]   It was called the National Defense Authorization Act,
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.280]   a bill that would eventually eliminate
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.400]   habeas corpus for military prisoners.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.280]   And they did sign it.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.040]   So I don't know what's going on, but we will talk about that
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.280]   in just a little bit.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.440]   I also want to congratulate our friend Tom Merritt.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.520]   And I, as actor, and Sarah Lane and Jason Howell on our tech
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.320]   news today team, our news department,
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.200]   won a big award at CES this week.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.320]   Very proud of them.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.040]   They won the International Association of Web Television
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   Award as Best News Show, Best Online News Show.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.280]   Do you want to see the video?
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.440]   Yeah, let's see the video.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   Here we go.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.000]   Here they are receiving the award.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.120]   You know what's cool?
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.320]   The guy who gave the award, Josh Molina, one of my favorites.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.320]   It doesn't flop sweat.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.080]   I'm a little out of shape, and this is heavy.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.720]   It's really heavy.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.520]   It's a big award.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.080]   It's huge.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.200]   These digital news days, people are just as likely
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.000]   to check their Twitter feed as the Wall Street Journal
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.480]   for the most important news topic of the day.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:18.960]   What kind of muffin Coldplay as a band had for breakfast?
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.120]   That didn't go over too well with the audience, did it?
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   No.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   That was very polite laughter.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.280]   I'm going to use your best.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   There it is.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.720]   Your two-year-old series are Breakout.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   Daily Ticker.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.080]   By the way, Jason Howe was a little mortified
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.400]   that he didn't have a motion graph.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.880]   No, we got to work on that.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.080]   Franko Show.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.280]   The Woodward Report.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:45.760]   Go for it.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.040]   The IAWTV Award goes to Tech News today.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.560]   Tech News today!
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.600]   There they are.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.440]   Yeah, I'm so proud of them.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.520]   This is the first year that they've done these awards.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.400]   You know, I kind of avoid awards shows in general,
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.960]   because, you know, I always--
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.880]   It's very easy.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.880]   But I'm just very glad we won.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.920]   I'm just very glad we won.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.360]   This is a great-- this may be the big award
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.000]   going forward, I would feel.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.280]   We deserve the congratulations.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:13.840]   Look at them.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   Yes, congratulations.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.360]   We go for a very targeted audience, and we try to do a good job.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.840]   The award show is the only thrill of it when you win.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.920]   Yes, suddenly it's got real relevant.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.520]   Thanks a lot.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.840]   We work really hard, so it's nice to be recognized.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.000]   We've been covering CES.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.400]   That's why we have this 1,000 yard stare.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.000]   And here it is.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.600]   This is the award.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.200]   It is heavy.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.600]   And it looks like French fries.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.960]   Actually, kind of more like an Escher thing.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.160]   Anyway, that's nice to have that first one of those.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.000]   And by the way, the episode that they submitted to Tim Stephens
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.160]   was on that episode, by the way.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.280]   Hey, so Tim, you get the award, too.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.000]   Oh, that's great.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Thank you.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.320]   It almost looks like a Fortress of Sawantu to me a little bit.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.000]   Oh, yeah, is that?
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.160]   The Fortress of Sawantu.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   Pretty cool.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.040]   I bet you Tom would like that.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.160]   So we'll put that on the shelf behind Tom and TNT.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.680]   Meanwhile, let's check in and see what's going on with the week ahead, Tom.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.920]   Actually, we don't have a week ahead.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   Never mind.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.120]   Pretend I said nothing.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.720]   That was your week ahead.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   That was the week ahead.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.760]   We will cover CES.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.120]   Everybody here, except for Omelik, was there.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.240]   And Om is glad.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   Let me tell you.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.520]   Let me tell you, Om didn't miss a thing.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   You said it.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.760]   I called it one year, the "Craptastic Electronics Show."
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.160]   There is far more junk than there is good stuff.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.000]   But we found the good stuff.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.640]   And we'll tell you what it was in a bit.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.960]   Before we do that, let me tell you about the good stuff in web hosting.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.240]   You notice that site that we were on the inside Twit.tv site.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.720]   That's inside.twit.tv.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.800]   That's our company blog.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.360]   That's a Squarespace blog.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.040]   I defy you right now.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.720]   Everybody who's watching this show, whatever, four or 5,000 of you, go to that site and
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   bring it down.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.800]   Go ahead, try it.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   You can't.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   We've tried it before.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.280]   That's because it's a Squarespace site.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.680]   I can bring any site in the world down.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.640]   I felt really bad.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.960]   We had a guy, a startup called Warlise.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.880]   It was a 3D chat avatar.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.360]   It really looked cool.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.800]   We got the guy on our CES coverage.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.240]   And the site went 503 immediately.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.880]   It just bombed.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   And I felt bad.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.480]   In fact, I got an email from him apologizing to all the people who tried to sign up during
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   that.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   We're okay now.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.480]   We come back.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.640]   But I mean, that was his big chance.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   And it bombed.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   See if he'd been on Squarespace.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   No problem.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.480]   It's web hosting plus the best content management software out there to give your site just a
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.640]   great look, a great feel and make it responsive.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:42.280]   If you go to squarespace.com, they have the best try-it-free policy ever.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.600]   You click this green button.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.680]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.960]   You don't need any information.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:51.880]   You just need the name of your site, a password for your site, an email address for your site.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:56.480]   And you've got that site with all the features, no watermark saying, "This is a beta.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   Nothing.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.080]   You've got all the features for two weeks."
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.480]   This is a great idea for trying it out.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.400]   You know what Alex Lindsey does, I've mentioned this before, when he goes to a restaurant or
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:14.440]   a business that they don't have their own website, he'll go on and my favorite restaurant.com
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.560]   and create a site for them.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.120]   And then he'll give it to them.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120]   He'll give them a case.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   I set this up.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.480]   He'll create it all here.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   Have it.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   Try it for two weeks.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.200]   He's turning people on.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.640]   He's making people get websites.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.120]   And that's one great use.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.840]   By the way, if you already have a site, you can import all of your text, all of your
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.920]   comments, all of your SEO, all of your pictures from moveable type, WordPress type pad or
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.280]   blogger APIs and export.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.760]   You're never trapped.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:48.600]   They have fantastic apps for iPhone and Android phones and tablets that let you post, check
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.920]   statistics, moderate comments, templates that look gorgeous, photo galleries, Twitter,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.360]   Flickr, Facebook integration and more.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.440]   Take a look at the examples.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   Give it a free try.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.640]   And if you decide to buy, we get you 30% off for the first three months.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   How about that?
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:10.880]   With the offer code TWIT01, TWIT01, TWIT01, 30% off.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   That's only when you buy those.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.520]   So don't even worry about that for right now.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.520]   Just give it a try.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.680]   Squarespace is secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   Let's just try it.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   Let me just try it.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   Let me go.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.680]   Let me just.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.520]   This is we'll do a live test to see if it worked inside dot twit dot TV.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.600]   Were you able to bring it down?
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's see.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.120]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   Did you bring it down?
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   It's just our internet.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.120]   It's my internet.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.120]   It's really slow.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.120]   There we go.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   No, it's not down.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   It's fine.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   Love it.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   Love it.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.320]   Thank you, Squarespace.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   We love you.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.720]   Squarespace.com use the offer code TWIT01.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.760]   May I interrupt you for once?
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.680]   Yes, Eileen Rivera, a steamed producer and host of All About Androids Show.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.560]   I just want to double check to make sure you've, we are on the same page for us.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.000]   Oh, I did the wrong commercial, didn't I?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.640]   I have carbonite and fresh books.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   Why do I have a Squarespace?
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   I don't know.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.280]   In this stack.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   That's all right.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   My clipboard says that.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.680]   Squarespace is a fabulous site.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.680]   You know what they add?
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.720]   Yeah, they add, they add, well, we got a free ad.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   How about that?
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   I don't want it.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   I love it.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   Free ad just for you.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.920]   Squarespace, you give us a lot of free stuff.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.120]   Let's talk about CES.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.400]   Ome, you can weigh in.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.960]   You could say that's crap.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.280]   I'd like that if you did that.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.000]   Take the John C. de Vorac honorary role.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Okay.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.240]   That's hard to do.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:37.040]   Let me ask, let me start with Tim Stevens.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.920]   You know, one of the things that we go, what we go to CES now, there's 150,000 people.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.480]   There's 3,100 booths this year.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.560]   There's 6,000 in the press corps.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.760]   It's an overwhelming, I don't know how many football fields, hundreds of football fields
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   with stuff.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   But one of the things-
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   One of the things-
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   It's huge.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:56.520]   One of the things we always try to do is create a narrative around that.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.080]   Like what was the story of CES?
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.880]   Almost impossible.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.800]   What was the story of CES, Tim Stevens of Engetch?
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.440]   I think this year that the story was the lack of the story.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   It wasn't a big one.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   Indeed it's going to be one.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   We're going to get a little bit of a regression in lots of logical areas.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:19.680]   We got LTE smartphones, which of course we're expected, but we saw LTE is now almost a common
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   feature across all cares and manufacturers.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.320]   So if anything, that's the story that LTE is now effectively what you're going to expect
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   to see on all carriers.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.880]   So that's something we said, bigger screens of course, and better processors and things
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   like that as well.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.120]   On the smartphone front, same sort of progress on the tablet front, high resolution displays
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.240]   on the new transformer prime, for example, a 1080p display.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.920]   That's a 10s from our prime.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   That is a cool product.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.800]   I'm working on Ice Cream Sandwich, the latest Android.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.240]   20 hours battery life with the dock.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   And you said, as you said, HD resolution.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.240]   Was it 12?
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   Was it 12?
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   80 by 720?
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   What was the resolution on it?
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.560]   It's greater than 1080p, I believe it's a 1920 by 2000 I think it is.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   Wow.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.120]   So it's on a 10 inch panel, which is fantastic.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.200]   And quad core.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   Yes, yes.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.120]   It's a tech with three graphics.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   So it's actually got that.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.320]   1920 by 1200.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   It is.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.200]   So, yeah, it's got great power.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.000]   And we've seen the Tever3 chipset offering not only great power, but also great battery
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   life.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.160]   Like you mentioned, in my test on the current transformer prime, I get 16 hours with the
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.400]   keyboard dock.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.520]   So they're saying we might even get a little bit better with this new model, which is
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.080]   pretty interesting.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.000]   So that to me is great to see.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.200]   We also spoke with Texas Instruments who showed us their new TI OMA processor, which isn't
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.240]   going to be hitting devices until sometime later this year.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.920]   It was the same basic theme that we're going to be seeing much better performance and also
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   much better battery life out of their new chipset, which is fantastic news because,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:51.000]   in my opinion, I think we're at a point now where gadgets are pretty quick, but battery
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.960]   life is still atrocious on the majority of Android tablets and Android phones and even
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.160]   phones, other platforms as well.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.280]   So I'm really hoping to see a big battery life improvement.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.400]   I think that's something we'll see going into the next CES right now.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.760]   We're not really seeing any big advancements.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:10.040]   But it seems like the foundation is being put in place to allow that kind of thing.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.400]   Intel was showing off UltraBooks.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:17.520]   Really the only computer computers at the show were the UltraBook laptops.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.840]   This definitely was a big year for UltraBooks, for sure.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.440]   The platform has existed for quite a while now, but this is the first CES where we saw
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   almost an overwhelming number of the things.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.560]   It just seemed like every computer manufacturer had their own take on the UltraBook recipe.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.160]   Actually, ASUS was a winner there, too, I think with the ZenBook.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.320]   That's my favorite.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.080]   Although Lenovo had that funny yoga.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.600]   Bendable, yeah, the yoga.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.160]   It was convertible, so it turned into a tablet.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   There it is.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.480]   Here we've got a video of the Lenovo Yoga.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.920]   I think best name, winner for the best name at CES.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.520]   I'm so bored with these '94 T37 and all that stuff.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   A concept transformer a couple of years ago called the Yoga as well, but it was much
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.360]   smaller like the size of a tablet page.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.000]   The idea is it's a normal laptop.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.120]   You see it running Windows 8 there.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.000]   The hinge, I don't know why more people don't do this, goes all the way around.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.560]   We're going to split it up and have a Windows 8 tablet.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.760]   That was definitely a very innovative product.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.640]   That was the kind of product that I thought we'd actually get a port of.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.480]   I thought we'd be seeing a lot more crazy Windows 8 devices that were fitting in between
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   tablets.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.480]   That was a surprise to me.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.480]   There was no Windows 8.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:32.120]   I think you have to blame Microsoft for this because they're still with a divisional developer
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.480]   preview.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.040]   They didn't update that.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.840]   They didn't talk about Windows 8 much at all.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:43.120]   There were very few Windows 8 devices and all of them were running that developer preview.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.360]   It was a little bit of discussion on these.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.400]   It was a big story in the Microsoft keynotes the night before the show properly kicked
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   off.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.160]   They spent a lot of time demoing Windows 8, but ultimately they didn't really show us
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   anything new.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.160]   Nothing new.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.040]   They didn't show me anything that really entailed bringing the platform together, which we talked
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.760]   a bit about at CES.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.560]   I didn't really see that much interaction between Windows Phone and Windows 8 or between the
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.360]   Xbox 360 and Windows 8, which is what I really wanted to do.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.720]   Except that Metro is the interface across the entire Microsoft line.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   They really hit that hard.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.440]   They might not work together, but they at least look pretty much the same.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.000]   The Metro ARM tablets won't run Windows software.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.200]   It is a phony across the line.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:33.320]   They did have the Tweet Choir, however, which I think is really every keynote from now on
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.680]   should have the Tweet Choir.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:44.040]   The Las Vegas Mask Choir.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.120]   No doubt talented.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   You're a little out of context.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   I think that somebody told me they were reading them.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:06.520]   Like they're on a screen in front of them.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.400]   I was in the room and didn't seem that live to me, but maybe it was.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.360]   No, it seemed a little stage to me.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.600]   Did they can memorize that before?
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.480]   Or were these fake, do you think these were fake, fake, fake?
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.640]   They were the real choir.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.440]   No, I know they were real choir.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.360]   No, they were real tweets as well.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.680]   The question is how early did they go in and have a little bit of time to prepare before
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.680]   the keynote began?
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   This is nice.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680]   I don't want to be too cynical.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   It was definitely impressive for either way.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   It was one of the more entertaining moments.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   More impressive than the more entertaining parts of that keynote.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   I'll put it that way.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.720]   Ryan Seacrest, did he get an A+ for making Steve bomber seem extremely uncomfortable or
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   just a little uncomfortable?
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.520]   Ryan Seacrest pretty much pointed in in my opinion, who's sitting up there reading the
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:51.160]   script between takes of windows 8 and Seacrest would be up there reading the script.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   You could just see him saying, "Where's my check?"
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   Wait for the check.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.800]   You've got this big partnership for advertising, I think, and I wonder if this isn't maybe
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   part of that.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.280]   Part of his contractual obligation.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.360]   Here is my favorite moment of the tweet choir.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.400]   My favorite tweet of the tweet choir.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.960]   Because I just love the way she adds some drama to this tweet.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   Oh my god!
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   You've all made it feel like Steve.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   It's hilarious!
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   Oh, kiddokey.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   They were good.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   They were definitely very good.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   You know, maybe they made it.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.200]   There was an autotuned rap of Steve bomber in Bill Gates at the beginning too, which was
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   pretty good.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.960]   Now, I think there was a big announcement at this, which was the Lumia 900.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.320]   Nokia's phone, designed for the US market, they have a similar phone in the European
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.160]   market with a smaller screen, no front-facing camera.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.600]   This is a sweet phone, and this may be the phone that Microsoft needs to get Windows
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.240]   phone 7 and a half off the map.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.080]   It could be the phone that Nokia needs to make it a little reemerge here in the United
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   States.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Nobody really knows who Nokia is.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.880]   When you talk to general consumers, they might have had a Nokia phone back in the '90s.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.400]   This is definitely a fantastic phone.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.560]   It's the new 900.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.480]   It's great performance and theory.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.080]   It's still single core, but it should be pretty quick and pretty smooth.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.640]   It should have a great camera, of course, as we expect, and a big beautiful screen.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.120]   That is, unfortunately, though, still WVGA.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.120]   Really?
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.680]   It's an OLED display, though, I think.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.320]   It is an OLED display, so the quality is going to be very good in terms of saturation
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320]   and brightness.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.920]   The resolution, though, that's still part of the package when you get Windows phone right
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   now.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.640]   You still get a WVGA display across the board.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.280]   I think that's something that Microsoft will be working on through the year, increasing
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.000]   resolution, and also moving from single core to dual core processors.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.200]   Those are two things that are part of the package of Windows Phone right now.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.560]   But at least we are not seeing LTE devices.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.920]   This was one of the first, of course.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.320]   We did see a few Windows Phone devices with LTE.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.440]   Going forward, at least that platform will now be able to keep up on data speeds, but
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.560]   now it needs the processors and the resolution to be able to keep up with the rest of the
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.440]   competition that we saw from the HTC for Samsung and from everybody else.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:21.760]   The LTE from both Ryzen and AT&T was available at CES in Vegas.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   I wasn't able to try it.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.200]   Were either of you able to try it?
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.200]   I wasn't able to try it.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.960]   How fast was it, Tim?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   We had AT&T LTE dongles.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   I also had a Ryzen LTE dongle.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.560]   Before the show began, we were seeing about 20 megabits down on AT&T and about 8 megabits
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.560]   up.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.440]   Once things got going, of course, it slowed down a bit.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.240]   It was down to about 8 down and 2 or 3 up, which is pretty fantastic given the number
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.080]   of people and the number of devices there.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:53.480]   But of course, AT&T just really flipped the switch on LTE in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.720]   So that's not really to be surprised.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.640]   I don't think it was saturated, which is exactly why we wanted to be on it because we
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.360]   knew that there wouldn't be too many other people on it.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.840]   Ryzen we saw typically 10 to 15 megabits down and again 2 or 3 up to a pretty comparable
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840]   speed.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   That's nice.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.080]   I was on Sprint's Y-Max and it was much slower.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   Y-Max is terrible.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   It does not work well in Vegas.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   And Sprint in fact is good.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.960]   I think they're canning that as well.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:19.080]   I want to run by, I actually did find a theme of the show of sorts, which is remember years
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:26.080]   ago both Gates and Jobs talked about the PC or the Mac as the hub of your digital life.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   Now it's the truck.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080]   It's not the hub.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.880]   It struck me that at this show, what people were saying is the mobile phone as the hub
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.160]   of our physical life.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   And by that I mean-
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.160]   That's true.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.120]   It's been garage door opener that you open with or you check your mobile phone.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.080]   LG and all of their smart appliances, right?
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.920]   The washing machine sends a message to your mobile phone telling you that it's time to
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   put the clothes in the dryer.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.720]   The refrigerator tells you that your yogurt's going bad.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.040]   All on the mobile phone.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.440]   I saw so many devices schlog.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440]   You open the lock with your mobile phone.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.520]   And it just seemed to me, and this by the way is the subject of my column in tomorrow's
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520]   Santa Mercury News.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.040]   It'll be on Larry's World in the morning about how the mobile phone really has become
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.080]   the core of our physical of our real world life.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   Absolutely.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.400]   We even saw quite a bit of automotive technology built around the smartphone.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.560]   Mercedes M-Brace, for example, you can unlock your car from your smartphone.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.320]   OnStar has an app as well that you can do that.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.800]   We saw applications where instead of having some cars, you can have one key for yourself
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.120]   and maybe one key for your wife.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.440]   And based on what key comes to the car, the seat will adjust itself.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.280]   Well, now there are systems like that that tie into your smartphone.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.920]   So you don't even need to worry about the key.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.880]   It's depending on what smartphone comes to the car.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:39.840]   It'll adjust your radio presets, your seating position, and get the car ready for yourself.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.080]   And I think with things like Google Wallet as well, more and more of our identity is moving
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.440]   to our devices, which to me is good because I'm kind of sick of carrying around a wall
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.480]   and I'm kind of sick of carrying around keys.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.400]   If I could walk up to my front door and put my phone up to the doorbell and have the door
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.520]   open or walk up to my car with my phone in my pocket and have the car unlocked and lights
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520]   turn on.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.080]   And it sounds ideal as long as, of course, I don't lose my cell phone.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.240]   I wonder if I could hack my way into your house instead of hiring a thug to break your
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.520]   door on an hire a hacker to get in there.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   Well, you know, they're already doing that with cars.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.080]   We've seen hackers hack cars from a distance even.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080]   Yeah, we have.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.680]   One of the interesting uses of NFC, apparently, I know some people talked about this is for
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.120]   Bluetooth pairing, to simplify the pairing, which will be great.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.560]   If I can tell my phone on something and say, "Pair use son of a gun."
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.920]   And by the way, Ford is really big into the apps tied in with their new electric cars,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:40.400]   their new hybrid cars, charging stations, finding whether your car needs to be charged.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   Every manufacturer.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.800]   And by the way, we should mention Ford's response.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Oh, I forgot about that.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   So, disclaimer.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.440]   But every man, and so I'll do this, every manufacturer, although I thought this was
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.280]   weird, Mercedes showed a Facebook app for his car.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.680]   I do not want people updating their status while they're driving down the highway at
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   80 miles an hour.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680]   Well, that's funny.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.680]   I interviewed Malawi.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:04.200]   Did you see the concept, Dash, that the Mercedes Benz had, which tied social networking into
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   driving in a very interesting way?
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.400]   Yeah, that's a lot of you can say where you're going, where your GPS is, would give his status
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.480]   update to Facebook.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.240]   I think if whole distracted driving issue is going to get bigger and bigger.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.480]   Actually, let's talk about that, because we were at a dinner.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:23.400]   Veronica was there, Patrick Norton, Molly Wood, Becky Worley, Walt Mossberg and David
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.200]   Polk, a bunch of tech journalists, we had a dinner with Alan Malawi that night, and
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.320]   Mossberg hijacked the whole thing.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.520]   What a surprise.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.320]   And basically, it was really challenging, Alan, about this issue.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.680]   He said, "No, I want to know what you guys say."
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:49.280]   He said that there is a grassroots movement in every city of the nation to get legislation
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:54.560]   against distracted driving, that this has become a huge hot button for people.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.360]   And he said, "What are you going to do?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.600]   What is Ford going to do when it's made illegal to make a phone call on your car, let alone
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   Facebook?
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.000]   You can't even use Bluetooth phones."
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   Yeah, because it's definitely something that's becoming a bigger and bigger issue than the
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   TSA.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Do you hear this, Grams?
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Well, Tim, I mean, was that true?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.600]   The NSA is also looking at defining the NTSB said that all use of any phone.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.200]   I think it's really not the NIH.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.800]   Yes, so it's definitely becoming a bigger issue.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.960]   And a lot of these things that we saw at the show would be very distracting that concept
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.480]   Mercedes Dash I was talking about would show you, if your friend happened to be running
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.800]   by while you're driving, it would pop up their profile information on the windscreen,
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.320]   it would reject it on the windscreen.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.960]   Which is pretty cool.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.560]   So I asked Mercedes, of course, what does this mean for distracted driving?
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.400]   Aren't you going to be looking at that and run over somebody else?
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.240]   And their answer was, "Well, this is the dash of five to ten years of the future."
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.680]   Why then the cars will be driving themselves anyway so you can do well, whatever you want
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.680]   to.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.080]   But of course, we're looking at the next two or three years, which is going to be, I don't
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.800]   think we'll be seeing self-driving cars on the road in any number.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.680]   No, I asked Allen about that.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.120]   And he, you know, Malali, the CEO Ford, came from Boeing where he said, "I was responsible
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.480]   for every Boeing fly by wire cockpit right up to 777."
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.520]   And he said, "You don't see pilots."
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.480]   He said, "These planes can take off and land by themselves, but you don't see pilots doing
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.480]   that."
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.240]   He says, "There needs to be a human at the wheel.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.040]   We will give them lots of information.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.280]   We will support them.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.080]   We will tell them if they're drifting out of the lane.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.200]   We'll tell them if they're running too close to the car ahead.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.400]   We can do all of that.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.160]   In fact, they have now backup, you know, I have a backup camera, but they have sensors
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.280]   that look left and right to tell you if there's an oncoming car, which is great because I've
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.000]   actually got hit by backing out of a slot.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.440]   So but he says, "You got to have a human at the wheel."
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.440]   And I do wonder, somebody else asked him, "When do we get our flying cars?"
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   And he said, "Never."
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   He said, "Never."
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   Look at the cloud vehicles.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440]   That's true.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   That's true.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   That's true.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.640]   Well, I talked with him earlier in the day and we talked a lot about this distracted driving
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   issue.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   It's a big issue.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.640]   It's a big issue.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.920]   And they claim, of course, that they've got great technology to make it easier, voice
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.520]   controls or big on voice controls.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.280]   And I have to say voice controls aren't I?
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.880]   By the way, I got pulled over in Nevada for talking to Siri on myself when I picked up
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   my phone.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   Yes, because you held your phone.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   You're not.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   You're not.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   And I was going to, Bluetooth, I had everything right, but I was told never touch your phone.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   Never phone your phone.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.560]   You may not touch that phone.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560]   So now I have my phone.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560]   Can you see the Velcro?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.400]   I have my phone Velcroed to the dash, right?
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   Right.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   So that's legal.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   Oh, now it's the dash?
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.480]   No, I can legally, as long as it's Velcroed to the dash, I can legally touch it.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   I can stare at it.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.520]   But if I take it like this and I say, "Siri, find me the brick house."
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.280]   One of our employees got pulled over because she was flipping her phone around in her hand.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.280]   Oh my gosh.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.200]   So, you know, go ahead, Dom.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:50.000]   So the thing, you know, I was watching all the feeds and reading all the news about CES.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.040]   And most of this conversation you guys are having and most of the devices I saw, none
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.080]   of them answered this one question.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.440]   What problem are they trying to solve?
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:07.640]   I mean, it's like, how is it, why is Facebook's status update from a friend important while
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   I'm driving?
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   First of all, I don't drive.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.840]   So I won't even know how they're all moving.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840]   It's not home.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840]   I'm a driver.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.840]   Right.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.800]   So I think there is a lot of people doing things for the sake of doing things and trying
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.640]   to keep up and, you know, imagine that they can keep up with somebody like Apple, for
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.200]   instance, and see that they're trying to predict what the next behavior is going to
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.840]   be without really thinking about what problem they're going to solve.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.560]   And I think that was a big, big, you know, my takeaway from this CES was just that.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.400]   I think that a lot of CES is trying to create demand.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.680]   It's trying to invent demand.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.200]   It's not an answer to a problem or an existing issue.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.400]   It's trying to create new demand.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:55.360]   And you know, remember Steve Jobs quoting Henry Ford who said, if I'd asked my customers
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.400]   what they wanted, they would have said, you know, what do you say?
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.400]   Faster horse.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   Faster horses.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.520]   You can't necessarily in this industry ask customers what they want.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.040]   You kind of have to point them in a direction and create a demand for something.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.360]   Did people say we needed Siri before Siri existed?
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.040]   People say we needed an iPhone before an iPhone.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   I don't know.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040]   Maybe they did.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.400]   Do you want to know she was she sending you an email telling you that the time for the
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   clothes in the drawer?
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400]   Actually, that's the text.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.800]   I kind of like that because I don't know how many times I've done a load of laundry
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.200]   and then forgotten about it.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   Two or three days later, I go to do another load of laundry and find that the first load
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   is still sitting there.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.600]   And but now it's all musty, of course, because it's been sitting in the washer for a couple
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600]   of days.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.240]   But whether or not this is solving problems, no, it's not.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.280]   But all cars now are pretty good.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.360]   I mean, it doesn't really matter what kind of car you buy.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.800]   It's going to be pretty reliable.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.560]   It's going to be reasonably good to drive.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.520]   It's going to be reasonably safe.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.120]   So many factories are really looking for ways to stand out and technology is a great way
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.440]   for them to do that, whether it's Facebook updates or whether it's the my Ford, smart
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.280]   link, excuse me, the my Ford app integration, excuse me.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.600]   Appling, you are tired.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600]   You're buzzed.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   Three hours to do.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600]   That's a CES buzz.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600]   I recognize it.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600]   Thank you.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.600]   The Appling app, which of course they just added six new apps to that gives you streaming
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.040]   music and that kind of thing.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that that to, you know, an 18 to 24 year old buyer is
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.280]   going to make their ears perk up.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.640]   And if somebody is Chevy or somebody on that doesn't have that kind of thing, that might
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.480]   make them by the focus instead of a key.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.960]   Ford didn't say that they said it drives a lot of demand for cars.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:38.480]   So I agree with that because what it is doing is it's replacing existing user behavior of
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.560]   listening to radio with a new kind of listening to music, right?
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.280]   Which is not very different than what we've done in a car.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.600]   And from, you're just using a new way of doing things.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.480]   However, a lot of these things which these people have been experimenting with are not
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480]   even clear.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480]   Like, why?
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.240]   Like, why do we need this?
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:05.840]   And, you know, and actually it's a very vendor centric approach to introducing features and
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.480]   technology and not like people centric approach to introducing technology.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.800]   Yes, you know, Steve Jobs.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.680]   This is not a Steve Jobs like comparison.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.480]   I'm thinking more like these guys are introducing incremental things.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.280]   We don't really make a lot of sense over, you know, like when it comes to usage.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.880]   And I think that's what I was having an issue with like Pandora or something like Pandora
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:37.480]   or Spotify on your dashboard connected via whether it's LTE or Wi-Fi or whatever makes
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.800]   perfect sense because that's how we listen to music now on our computer.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:50.320]   So it just is a behavior which translates easily to the car environment.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.880]   So we don't have to deal with, you know, like, you know, fiddling with too many buttons
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.360]   on Pandora, for example.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   I agree with you.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.800]   And I think that's a lot of what you see at CES is people throwing stuff against the
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.360]   wall to see what sticks.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.920]   They're trying to create demand.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.000]   And you're right fundamentally that is a flawed way to invent something.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.920]   You know, you want to find a problem that needs solving.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   But this is a big show.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920]   There's 3,100 booths.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.160]   There's got to be some crap.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.000]   In fact, somebody in the chat room is asking us for our worst of CES.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.200]   And maybe if you guys could do some thinking, I'll think of some of the worst things that
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   we saw.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.360]   Here is a big story that you guys came up with at Gigahome.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.080]   Actually, your Kevin Fittcher pointed this out.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:38.280]   Verizon told CNET that Verizon will no longer accept any smart device that doesn't support
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.240]   its LTE network.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.840]   And Kevin pointed out, hey, that means the iPhone 5 is going to be LTE.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840]   Does that make sense?
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.520]   Yeah, and that would be nice.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.520]   It sure would.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.520]   It sure would.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.760]   Especially if it's LTE on an AT&T, which I think is, we agree the fastest out there
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   right now.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.560]   Maybe because it's underused.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.400]   I tell you what, I couldn't use 3G on my iPhone at all.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.400]   No, it's terrible.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   I couldn't last year.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400]   It couldn't be this year.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   Horrible.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   I missed the whole week.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.680]   By the way, I drove down to CES.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:16.280]   And I have a pioneer head unit in my car, which connects to my iPhone.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.760]   And I listen to Pandora the whole week.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   Isn't that great?
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.760]   But here's the irony.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.640]   Do you got to feel sorry for terrestrial radio?
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   You work at the TV.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.920]   I used to work at KGO, which kind of everybody got fired.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.440]   Terrestrial radio.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.000]   I actually had a discussion with my colleagues at CBS radio about this two or three years
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.760]   ago when the iPhone, it was AOL radio, made stations available.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.480]   AOL radio isn't what it was.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.760]   But the fact is that I can listen to CBS online.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.440]   I can listen to you and my car, which means you are now a direct competitor to CBS radio.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   That's right.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.720]   Well, I don't know if I like that, Leo.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.120]   But the bottom line is that content providers have got to think of themselves as content
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.080]   providers and stop thinking themselves as a broadcaster.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   That's right.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   And that's true.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   That's absolutely right.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.480]   And the car was the one bastion that terrestrial radio owns.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   That's right.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   And it's going away.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.560]   And current listening was the only thing that kept AM radio alive.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.560]   And FM2.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560]   So it's a concern.
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.800]   You're dealing with it.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   What about OLED TVs?
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.640]   Oh, I bet you don't.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.520]   You don't drive a car.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.840]   You don't eat meat.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.000]   I bet you don't watch TV either.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.200]   I do watch TV, though, not your live television as we've known it.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.560]   You're a cable cutter.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.960]   Yeah, I am.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.840]   And I watch all my TV and Hulu and Netflix.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   Look at the thickness.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840]   That is I.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   Oh my God.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.320]   That thing is four millimeters.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.320]   Sick.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.120]   It's like a plane of glass.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.000]   You know, actually, this video does capture how brilliant that screen is.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   It is gorgeous.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.640]   I do want that.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   You do want that, trust me.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.840]   In 3D, it's actually really amazing.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.680]   This is an OLED screen.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.560]   LG and Samsung both showed OLED screens at 55 inches.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.000]   Biggest we've ever seen.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.680]   Sony, which killed its 11 inch, $2,500 OLED screen, had something they called Crystal
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.320]   LCD, which I'm pretty sure was an OLED screen also.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.040]   This is the they and both LG and Samsung say they will be selling these by the end of
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.200]   this year.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   This is a real product.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.960]   I don't know what the price is.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   Eight grand.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   Five to eight.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.200]   I would guess what do you think, Tim?
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.000]   Do you have a price point?
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.920]   We're hearing around seven or eight grand at this point.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.440]   It's all guesses, but I would guess it'd be somewhere in the five to $10,000 range roughly
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440]   around $8,000.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.840]   You will want this TV.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.640]   I guarantee you the minute you see it.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   Yes, you will.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   It's beautiful.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   Both of them are beautiful.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.600]   I couldn't tell the difference between the two in terms of panel clarity, but of course
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.440]   they weren't anywhere near each other.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.040]   Yeah, you know, both beautiful.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:46.720]   I asked Robert Herron, who does HD Nation, HD TV expert, one of the founding members of
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.880]   TWIT.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.040]   He said the Samsung is going to be the winner because they're using a sub-pixel rendering
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:58.000]   on the LG display, a white pixel with filters, whereas the Samsung is true RGB.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   But you got it.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   You're right.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   You got it.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Amazing.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   Not seeing them.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.880]   Look at the thickness of that.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.040]   All the guts are in the base, by the way.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.560]   If you do get this and want to put it on your wall, you're going to have to punch a hole
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   in the wall or have wires.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.280]   And you're going to let's doing your version of the Euth as a Ray thing.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.240]   You could shave with it.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.200]   Actually, that was my favorite product, Shick.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.200]   Yes.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   I don't know.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   Every year, Shick is at CES, the Razor Company.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.880]   They had a barber there who was doing hot towel and then shaving you with a Shick.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880]   It was actually, I got one.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880]   It was a good to shave.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.880]   It was a very good plate.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.160]   I almost got one too, but I decided I didn't really quite want to be a good just game.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.720]   It's still pretty cold up here in New York.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   You'd have to find something else you should.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.120]   And a ladies version is forthcoming, I checked.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.640]   You know, that's funny because Nataly Morris asked me.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.280]   Nataly Morris said, "Do they do this for ladies too?"
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.280]   They're coming.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.080]   There's a ladies' shick on its way.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.200]   So the OLEDs, they're all 1080p, of course, 55 inches.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.800]   Beautiful, rich, deep blacks, whites that are perfect.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.160]   Price, yeah, it'll be crazy.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160]   At first.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.960]   But I think the point is that they're able now to make these displays in quantity, which
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.040]   I think they've never been able to do.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.480]   We asked them about display life because one of the issues of OLED displays has been in
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   the past.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.040]   The PewDie had a very short lifespan.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.720]   They claimed to have fixed it and have 30,000 hours, which is about half what plasma does.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.800]   But it's still 10 years of eight hours a day viewing.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   There's plenty of--
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   Plenty of life.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.600]   If you watch that much TV, you have other problems.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600]   Yes, really.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.600]   You can buy a new one in 10 years.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.400]   I have a question for you guys now that with all these TVs coming out, which is the best
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.800]   TV to buy right now, which is a bargain.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.320]   Oh, oh.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.160]   So you want it now, you want it cheap, and you want good?
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.160]   Tim Stevens, Engadget Editor-in-Chief.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:49.920]   Well, there's definitely talk that LCD prices could actually go up over the next 12 months
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920]   or so.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.280]   So if you're looking for a new TV, it might not be a bad idea to pick one up now.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.280]   Definitely.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.280]   I would say LCD.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.560]   I mean, there's a selection of plasmas that are still available, and they do give-- they
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.640]   do give kind of the look of an OLED with very deep, rich blacks and good contrast.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   But they're heavier.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   They use a lot more power.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   They give a lot more--
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   They give a lot more--
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.800]   If these OLEDs come out, I think plasmas are dead.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.200]   Plasmas are absolutely dead because OLEDs will do everything that a plasma does better with
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.240]   lower power consumption.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.200]   And hopefully they won't have the lifespan or burn-in problems down the road a little
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   bit too.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.200]   Of course, the cost is going to be huge.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.120]   I would say right now go with an edge-led LED display.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.840]   It will give you close to the thinness of an OLED display.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840]   Yeah, they're gorgeous.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.960]   You can certainly cheaper.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.480]   I like Samsung a lot, although Vizio is going to give you a better price.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.800]   And I think Vizio is quite good for the price.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.600]   I have a three-year-old Vizio, and I'm still happy with it.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   It's great.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.400]   And by the way, don't-- the thickness issue, it's very cool to have a thin TV.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.520]   The reality is it's up against the wall unless you look at a really tiny, tiny apartment.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.400]   That extra entry too is not going to make a difference in your life.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.280]   That's the more it's to say in the chatroom.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.840]   Who cares how thin they are, you know?
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.560]   But it's like anything else.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.360]   The thinner and richer, the better.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:06.720]   I have to say, the top of the line TVs right now are those sharp, elite TV sets.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.520]   But they're the same price as they so led will be in the fall.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.000]   They're $6,000 to $8,000.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.280]   I think that we are going to see a revolution.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.760]   If you could hold off, I would hold off.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.480]   Now, the other thing that's revolutionary is these in-TV apps, the speech interfaces,
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.760]   the Samsung has a built-in camera that you can do, connect style gesturing to or talk
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.080]   to.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.280]   This is early days, and I bet you these things suck for the first one or two years.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.920]   But we're clearly moving into that world of, you know, new TV interfaces.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.920]   TV-esque computer.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.920]   These are dual-core.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.200]   For us, Alil, instead of mom and dad fighting over the remote controller, they're going to
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.200]   see who can scream out us or wave the most.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.200]   I can't wait.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.200]   How do we get to control that?
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.200]   Shut up!
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200]   I want to watch Oprah!
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   Shut up!
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.200]   I want to watch Judge Judy!
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   Yeah, I can just imagine.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.280]   The louder the screen, the better your chances.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.280]   The TV goes back and forth.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.240]   This Samsung TV will recognize you.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.200]   And so it will configure itself for your settings, which is pretty amazing.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.680]   LG had Google TV built into its set.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.320]   Lenovo announced a TV with ice cream sandwich, not Google TV, but just ice cream.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   China only.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320]   China only?
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   Okay.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320]   That's in April.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.000]   But I do think that there's the facial recognition, by the way.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.800]   I do think that this is a revolution in television, and it's very good.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.480]   I like it because it's very good for people like me who are internet-only broadcasters.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.680]   Every TV that comes out from now on will have an internet connection and will have apps
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.880]   and will have the ability to put shows like Twit on a parody with everything.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.920]   No, I have a Roku.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.680]   I hardly ever watch cable anymore.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   I love it.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   It's all Roku.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.000]   It's all you and Netflix and Amazon.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.640]   I get to pick the programming.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.560]   It's an absolute revolution, and it's really good for internet broadcasters.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.440]   And now you see why YouTube's strategy.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:58.280]   There was a good article in The New Yorker this week about, is it, how do you pronounce
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.720]   it, "Kensil, the new guy who's in charge of content," the guy who's putting out $100
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:07.400]   million for new content channels, which launch next week on YouTube.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.040]   And basically that's YouTube's play.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.640]   They want to be IPTV for the next generation.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   They want to...
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.320]   It looks like even Hulu's going to make their own content.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.320]   Yes.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.840]   So Hulu, Netflix and YouTube are doing their own content, which kind of tells you, you
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.720]   know, who's got the power.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:30.160]   I think the Hollywood's in a central gravity shifting to Silicon Valley a little bit.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.400]   Well, except for the fact that the places Hulu and Netflix are going to get their content
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   is Hollywood.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   YouTube, a little less so.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   Right.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:47.160]   I'm talking about from a monetary standpoint, like that's where the initially all the...
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   By the distribution and production was concentrated very heavily in LA.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:59.200]   And now it's distribution is not in Hollywood and it's in Silicon Valley.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.520]   And production-wise, still Hollywood is still in Hollywood.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.320]   Well I think the content will still, much of it, come from Hollywood.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.880]   Who really gets disintermediated and ultimately screwed?
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:15.680]   Are the aggregators, the people like the television networks, cable companies like Comcast.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.920]   Comcast all of a sudden is going to be selling bits at wholesale.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.880]   And instead of these premium priced retail bits where they sell a whole channel, I think
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.080]   we're going to see a big shift.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.080]   And it's going to...
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.400]   We've been saying this for how many years?
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   It's finally starting to happen.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.640]   Well, here's the news story right now.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.280]   Hulu will broadcast its first original scripted series next month, a political comedy that
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.520]   will debut during the real life Republican presidential primaries.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520]   Sounds good.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.200]   I don't know who's producing this for, but again, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.600]   So don't watch the news, watch the sitcom.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.240]   Or if you're going to watch news, watch John Stewart.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.120]   Yeah, well that's true.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.480]   And that worries me a little bit actually.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.480]   I think fake news.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.960]   Yeah, the more credibility than real news.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Fake news is the real news.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.360]   And you know, Leo, when you were doing tech TV, I mean that was like a $100 million project.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360]   Right?
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.360]   But here.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.600]   Yeah, and that was dying because the distribution was controlled by essentially what was Hollywood.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   That's right.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.600]   And look at you now.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:21.480]   And like, you know, you probably have five times the audience and 100 times the engagement
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   compared to that time.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.560]   You know, I was there with you at that time.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   Right.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.520]   You know, this thing is, you know, probably was one of the few people who actually paid
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.520]   for it.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   Thank you.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520]   Thank you.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520]   Thank you.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.840]   So it is very different now.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:42.400]   And I think there is going to be more smaller success stories like yourself as this distribution
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.040]   gets more democratic.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.720]   I think that's the big shift.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.400]   We saw the production and distribution get democratized in music.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:59.440]   And we've seen a huge jump in creation of music and new artists and people just coming
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.840]   out of nowhere.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.240]   And I think we're going to see similar shift in video as well.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.360]   And it's taken a lot longer because it's just more expensive kind of, you know, operation.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.960]   I mean, yours is not an easy operation to move straight.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   Yeah, but it's still a lot cheaper than tech TV was.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.320]   I mean, that's true.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.920]   Because I want to be democratic.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.160]   I wonder, I mean, how long is it until Hulu and Netflix are just like ABC and NBC and then
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.520]   we get into the same network battles again that we're in a way now.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.920]   And this is why I'm a little touchy about Google and YouTube because it's almost as
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.480]   if the company that owns the guide on your cable channel, if they produced all the content
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.440]   and they made sure that all their content were somehow highlighted on their cable guide,
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.960]   that would be a huge advantage.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.640]   And in my opinion, that's exactly what's happening.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.400]   Google is the cable guide to the internet.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.000]   It's the guide to the internet, but they're producing content and they're highlighting
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.480]   And it's me at a disadvantage, even though in theory, we should be equals, you know, on
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.240]   the search anyway.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.800]   So I wish Google in fact, my goal for 2012 is to have Google spin off YouTube.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.960]   It's obviously profitable.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.640]   Spin it off into a separate standalone company and avoid all of this entanglement that it's
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.120]   getting into.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.440]   I think that that's a pipe dream.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:21.360]   However, obviously Google loves the entanglement it's getting into the Google TV.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.600]   It's only exactly that.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.200]   It's hugely valuable.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.000]   And I just, you know, I hope that Google doesn't start making Google TV.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.320]   Well, it has a YouTube channel, but I hope that my Twitter channel sitting next to the
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.400]   YouTube channel is a parody and equal.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.920]   And when you do a search, it does search through my stuff as well as their stuff, etc,
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   etc.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.160]   We'll take a break.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.120]   Come back with more Microsoft pulled out of CES.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.440]   It's this last year, Steve Bombers last keynote.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:56.040]   The space I was told by the CEA, the floor space for Microsoft's booth sold in 45 minutes.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.000]   We don't know who to, but I the rumor was dish network.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.240]   This is kind of near where Microsoft is, but not as not as prime a real estate.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.120]   I just hope they keep that really soft carpet.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.120]   Doesn't Microsoft?
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   I love the stuff.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.120]   They have the best carpet.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.120]   Beautiful.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.000]   It's great on your feet when you're walking around all day long and you're you're you're
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.560]   getting a little bit sore.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.320]   That's how you know through the booths because it's much more comfortable.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   If somebody says I was at CES and you want to you don't believe it, you just say, well,
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.920]   which carpet did you prefer?
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   They say what?
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.320]   Then you know they're lying.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.600]   It's Microsoft all the way.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.520]   We're going to take a break, talk about backup and then come back with more.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.520]   There are a lot there's a lot more, including an egg throwing incident in China that turns
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:42.000]   out to be a big story, but first, how do you like that for a tease?
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.800]   But first, let's talk about backing your stuff up with carbonite.com.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.800]   They're slogan.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   This is a new slogan.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.320]   I used to say you got to back it up to get it back.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.560]   Their new slogan is backup move forward.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.800]   I think that sounds a little confusing.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.080]   That should be Ford slogan backup move forward automatic online backup.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:04.440]   Anytime anywhere access, carbonite is the best deal in cloud storage.

[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.160]   I can access it from any computer I log into my carbonite account, iPhone, iPad, Android.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.480]   It's all their blackberry.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.480]   I can see.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.720]   So it's cloud storage less than five bucks a month for unlimited.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:38.280]   Now, people say all the time to me, well, what about if I have a lot of external drives?
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.120]   They do now have a plan for that.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.360]   Windows only, they're working on the Mac version.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   What if I'm a business?
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.360]   I have multiple computers.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.480]   They do have a plan for that.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.160]   So go to carbonite.com.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.880]   Take a look at the various plans, no matter which you want to use, two weeks free with
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   the offer code TWIT.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.680]   Actually, I think the business has a month free with the offer code TWIT.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:30:00.440]   And if you decide to buy 14 months for the price of 12, two bonus months, when you use
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.560]   our name TWIT, no credit card needed just the offer code TWIT.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560]   Give it a try.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   I think you're going to love it.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.600]   It's back up exactly how you would have designed it if you'd thought about it.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:18.520]   You know, automatic online encrypted storage that's available anywhere, five bucks a month.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:26.920]   Carbonite.com, we thank them so much for their support of the TWIT program.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.200]   Apple, the iPhone 4S, so what happened in China?
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.320]   There are five stores in Apple stores in China.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.320]   They sell some absurd percentage of all Apple gears, something like 16% of all Apple gears
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.200]   sold by five stores in China.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.040]   They had the iPhone 4S.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:52.160]   And what's amazing is this thing must cost a significant amount of money compared to
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.640]   the average income in China.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.720]   I don't know what it is, but I can only imagine.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:02.720]   But I guess the plutocrats in China, of which there is a growing middle and upper class,
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.560]   were hiring workers from the country to come and get in line at the Apple store to get
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.200]   them their iPhone.
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:17.080]   They pay these guys like a day's wage, which is peanuts, to get in line.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:21.920]   But I think it was 15 RMB.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:28.040]   And when the Apple stores didn't open on time, the crowds got rowdy.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.200]   Apple ordered the stores not be opened, so this is the mistake.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.560]   The Apple guy comes out and says, "We're going to cancel the launch of the 4S."
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.880]   At this point, the people who have been waiting all night, they're not going to get paid
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.920]   their 15 RMB.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.440]   I guess they brought eggs with them.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   You have to eat.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.480]   They start pelting the store.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.040]   Look, there's a guy, there's Jason from Friday the 13th.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.040]   There's a guy wearing a...
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.240]   This happens to go down on Friday the 13th.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   We tend to have a little bit of fun on Friday the 13th.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240]   It is Friday.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240]   Oh, I see.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   It's nice of them to show up anyway.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.840]   You added that.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.760]   That was an Easter egg?
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:06.960]   We do Easter eggs on Friday the 13th.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.280]   We have Jason hiding in a lot of our pictures.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.120]   So the secret's out now, but there are also legitimate eggs there being tossed at the
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   windows, which is...
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   You stole me.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.200]   I thought some smart worker was wearing a hockey mask.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.520]   I know that was an amazing Photoshop from one of our Andrews.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.520]   That is hysterical.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:31.200]   If you look back on Friday the 13th, just about every post should have some little tidbit
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.200]   from Friday the 13th.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.080]   And then whether it's some machete hiding somewhere, maybe a little bit of blood somewhere.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.280]   You're going to have a lot of fun.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.400]   I think 2012 has more Friday the 13th in it than we've had in the years.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.240]   This is our favorite days of the year.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.400]   We have a lot of fun.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.800]   Obviously you're not superstitious.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800]   No.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:53.440]   So they're not going to sell the 4S and Apple stores at all for the time being.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.960]   Apple's freaked out.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.160]   Where is this money coming from?
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.160]   It's very interesting.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.160]   There must be...
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:07.600]   Do you have any insight in this as our token representative of the third world?
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.600]   Oh.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.760]   Did you really say that?
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.760]   I did.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.280]   I thought about it and the sensor just...
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280]   I don't know.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   I guess it was taking a break.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   You know it used to be the total number.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   It's no longer.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   No.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280]   I know.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:30.680]   I was in Paris with you to remember for LeVeb and I went into a store trying to buy something
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:36.800]   and they had two representatives who spoke perfect Mandarin and perfect English to sell
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   to these people.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.360]   So that kind of tells you there is a lot of money in those places.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.360]   Absolutely.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   I think China is going to be the largest economy in a few years.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.080]   And so we cannot really say they are the third world.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:55.920]   Yes, they have huge income disparities, but so do we in the United States.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:56.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920]   So there is...
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:08.080]   It says a lot about Apple though, a product made in China and for China at a massive premium.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:11.120]   That says everything about a company and a brand.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.840]   I think a lot of people don't quite give them credit for that.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.120]   I do think this is going...
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:26.600]   iPhone 4s or iPhone or Apple products, they have an aspirational quality both in China
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.640]   and India, in Brazil, in Russia.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:35.600]   And just like the Gucci's and the world have and Mercedes and BMW have an aspirational
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.600]   value.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:41.280]   So I think that's why you're seeing a lot of people line up and pay.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.320]   I think the average salaries in China are going up.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.640]   I mean, if you go to Shanghai, it does definitely feel like a very expensive city.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.640]   Oh, Beijing too.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.640]   I've never seen such an amazing...
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.240]   I've never seen Beijing so I don't know.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.720]   Oh, it's incredible.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.240]   It's the most vibrant.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.720]   But it's also a very agricultural country.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.560]   You get outside the big industrial areas and it's basically a peasant economy.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.680]   So as you say, there's an income disparity there.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.880]   Is it... when you say aspirational, do you mean it's a status symbol?
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:22.320]   I mean, at least from where I come from, in a status symbol matter a whole lot, whether
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   it's at least in India, there is a huge pull of these famous global brands.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.560]   And I think US, sorry, China is essentially the same.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.720]   There is huge amount of value recorded to these brands.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.480]   But you know, the official colour there is right.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.480]   So that should...
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:46.880]   So it isn't about functionality there.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.440]   Really is about this is a status symbol.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.520]   This isn't because it's a better phone.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520]   In fact, I'm sure there are Chinese clones.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.840]   In fact, I know iPhone's running Android.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.840]   Absolutely.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.560]   And there was a time when Blue Genes were a great commodity.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.560]   I remember that.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.480]   Remember that all the Russians wanted their Blue Genes.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   When we went to Czechoslovakia, when I was a kid in '67, we packed Blue Genes.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.560]   Really much more valuable than gold.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:09.560]   That's right.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.320]   If you could bring a Blue Genes in there.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.960]   And I remember when we were in Egypt a couple of years ago, Ballpoint pens of all things.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.960]   Ballpoint pens.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.800]   We're a huge valuable commodity.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   I'm going to the Middle East.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.800]   I'll bring a bunch of ballpoint pens.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.120]   Hey, pay my way back.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.480]   Any particular kind like the Fisher Space Pen?
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   No, they don't.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.480]   They don't.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480]   Bring a bit.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:30.400]   Seriously, cheap ballpoint pens were very valued.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.400]   Very valued.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.400]   It's interesting.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.080]   I don't know what that means.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.920]   I saw a very interesting article.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.560]   I don't know if you guys saw this.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.920]   It's from tnl.net.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.160]   This is a little bit telling.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:51.240]   What they did is they did a survey of what of the top 100 movies in 2011, which of them
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:56.880]   are on Netflix, which of them are Netflix streaming, by the way, Amazon, which are
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.720]   on iTunes and which are on Voodoo and which are available on DVD.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   They broke it all down.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.280]   And when you get to the stats, it's actually a little chilling.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.600]   If I were Netflix, I'd worry.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:12.480]   Of the top 10 movies, zero are on Netflix, seven on Amazon iTunes, Voodoo and DVD.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:20.080]   Of the top 25, zero are on Netflix, 16 Amazon iTunes, Voodoo, 19 DVD.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.600]   Of the top 54 on Netflix.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.680]   Of the top 100, only five are available on Netflix streaming.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.960]   Almost half available on iTunes, Amazon and Voodoo.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.640]   And 74 out of the top 100 on DVD.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.600]   Now that's Netflix fault.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600]   I don't think Netflix is failing to make the deals.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.040]   I think the movie industry is trying to squeeze into that.
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.240]   Do you need to compare it to HBO and Showtime?
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.920]   Netflix is not where you go to see the latest movie.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.160]   It's where you go to see the backlist, to see the movies that were great 10 years ago
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   or 50 years ago.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160]   That's right.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.200]   In some cases, I watch old classics on Netflix.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.160]   If you were to ask Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, he would be the first to admit that
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.280]   it is just a choice.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.240]   But Netflix is where it's late at night, I'm tired, I don't feel like thinking, I go
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.640]   in there and I pick a movie much like I used to do on HBO and Showtime.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.800]   Well, it's funny, now I go to video on demand and I pay $6 for the latest movie.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.640]   But if I want, you're right.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.680]   If I want to see a kind of weirdo movie or a red dwarf or something, I will go to Netflix
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680]   and watch it there.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.680]   So they both have a role.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.000]   And at $7.99 a month, I guess Netflix streaming is cheap enough.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.960]   It's like one and a half VOD.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.480]   So I wonder, I worry about it when the stars contract ends, which will be in March and
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:33.280]   they're going to lose some of their titles, their newer titles, a lot of the newer titles.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.040]   And that's going to be a real challenge for them.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.240]   I'm surprised that Netflix hasn't launched some sort of a premium streaming tier where
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.200]   you can do a pay on demand sort of streaming for these newer movies that would then be
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.800]   additional to the standard all-new content streaming package that they already have.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.880]   Because that's what we're really looking at here.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.040]   Even though those seven top 10s on Amazon, you can't pay a flat fee and do them.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.480]   You have to rent them the same thing with iTunes, that kind of thing.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.920]   So it's a different pricing structure and a different sort of service that I'm very surprised
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.720]   that Netflix hasn't jumped into yet.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.480]   And maybe that's something that we'll see in the year ahead.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.680]   But I don't think you could blame Netflix in the long run.
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.280]   It really is Netflix being squeezed by Hollywood.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.160]   It says, we're not going to give you our good stuff.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.160]   What are you nuts?
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.160]   Sure.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.160]   What are you crazy?
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.840]   When's the last time you actually put a DVD into a player?
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]   It's been a long time.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]   I have five Netflix DVDs.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.240]   You're sitting around gathering dust from six months ago on my DVD player.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.960]   Because even though I could, it's so much easier to just press play on the Roku.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.600]   You better return those because they're going to hit you for the full value eventually.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600]   Eventually when?
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600]   Actually, how long do you keep paying now what?
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   The 16 days?
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600]   I'm paying for it.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.160]   I dropped that a long time.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.160]   They love me.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.160]   Are you kidding?
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.640]   I paid the 7.99 a month and I'm very happy.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.440]   I paid hundreds of dollars for the 5.99.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440]   They love me.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440]   They love me.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.240]   As far as I continue to rent them for 17 bucks a month, they're happy.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:55.960]   I saw some of these say, and I think this is interesting, that Netflix streaming has
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.520]   really given people, you know, behavior is very interesting.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.720]   Tivo never gained ground, but it totally transformed how we watch TV from being appointment
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.720]   television.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.040]   We all had to watch Ed Sullivan on Sunday night.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.760]   The VCR began that shift, but it wasn't until DVRs that we really accepted the idea that
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.240]   we did not have to watch a show when it was on.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.880]   We watch it whenever we want on demand is further that.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.080]   So our habits get changed by these technologies.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.120]   Somebody was saying that Netflix streaming is really turning us into channel surfers with
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.640]   movies.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.360]   You know, if you buy a DVD or lease or rent a DVD and you put it in, you're going to watch
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.400]   it because you don't have another one for one thing.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:37.120]   Even if it's crappy, you spend a lot of money for it.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.640]   But Netflix, I don't mind going, "Watch it five minutes a month."
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   And we're going, "This is crap."
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.280]   I'm going, "The next one, this is crap."
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.600]   Channel surfing movies.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.200]   I do that and I go back and forth between Netflix and Amazon Instant Prime.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.800]   It was Amazon if you have the Prime service for $80 a year.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.800]   You don't have as big a library, but it's a better deal.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.800]   I do both.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.800]   I do both, occasionally.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.080]   Hey for a movie on Amazon iTunes.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.520]   What's amazing is who needs network television or cable anymore?
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:05.960]   There's all this great stuff.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.280]   Well, can I put a word in for CDS news?
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.280]   Please, please.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.280]   Please.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.440]   No, I mean, if you want to watch, no, seriously, if you want.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.880]   The latest sports, the latest news.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.640]   Hey, we're watching the football game right now.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:20.240]   You're watching it on either broadcast or cable or satellite.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.400]   Nobody's listening.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.480]   How many people are watching this stream?
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:28.120]   Actually, the good news is geeks hate sports.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.120]   Some of us.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.960]   Our gaming show is coming up.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960]   If you're interested in gaming, we're about an hour away from the launch of our very
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.160]   new and very exciting game show.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.320]   It's called Game on Brian, Brushwood, and Veronica Belmont will host.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.240]   And I've got to tell you, I've been watching some of the pieces they're putting together
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   for this.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.680]   It is the daily show of video gaming.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.080]   I promise you, you're going to love this.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.480]   Look at-- here come Veronica and Brushwood.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.200]   We've got to come up with a name for you too.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.320]   Like BB and VB.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.320]   How about that, BB and VB?
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.320]   That's my two favorite.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.320]   Look at his voice.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.320]   Oh.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.320]   Oh.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320]   He likes you.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320]   Hey, everybody.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   Hi, Veronica.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.960]   What are we going to call them?
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:11.960]   BB and VB?
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.240]   I like the dork duo.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.240]   The duo of dorks.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.240]   Oh, she's panning on.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.240]   Oh.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.240]   Veronica Belmont.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.240]   I cannot tell you.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240]   What?
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.240]   Beshwood?
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.240]   Beshwood or-- what else?
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.240]   Batman and Catwoman?
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.240]   Belmont?
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.240]   Brushmont?
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.240]   Wait, that's you guys.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.240]   No, because--
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.240]   Belwood?
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   Because Ryan and I joke and say Blockmont sometimes.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240]   Blockmont's good.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240]   No, no, you can't do that.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   You have to be a couple to do that.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.240]   You too are just good friends.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.240]   We're not Brangelina.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.960]   I just-- it gives-- it makes-- you know, all of them, you talk about how the growth of
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.560]   the Twit Network, the fact that we could get these to some of-- to the most talented
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:56.520]   presenters in any medium to do a show about gaming and the production value we're going
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.240]   to put into this, it really is a huge step forward for Twit.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.240]   And really, I think if this-- if we could pull this off, I think it will show that you
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:10.600]   can do an internet production-- an independent internet company can do stuff that's just
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.040]   as good as anything on broadcast.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.040]   I'm very excited.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   You guys are the greatest.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.040]   I'm excited too.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Yeah, Tim.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.040]   We're like jittery excited.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Are you buzzing?
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.800]   It's like I'm drinking for the last time.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.960]   You guys came running out here like, oh, I'm so excited.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   It feels like I haven't slept in--
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   What's funny is like, you haven't.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.400]   We were backstage just sort of like-- we're in that weird doldrums where we've done all
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:31.400]   the pre-work, all the strips are--
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.400]   Yeah, there's nothing more to do.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.040]   All of the pre-production stuff is done and we can't quite start setting up.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.480]   So it's like, we're just back there, we're spitting our wheels.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.560]   Finally, we just went live on Justin TV to take our minds off of it.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.560]   Yeah, it's cute.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.560]   Yeah, and we're just like, please, somebody talk to us.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.560]   We got that.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.560]   Oh good, so where is that channel?
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.560]   Justin.tv/scamschoolbryon.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.560]   I'll spell that out.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.560]   Okay, great.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.560]   So right now you can see an empty editing bay.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:51.560]   An empty empty.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.560]   You can jump open it.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.880]   And the Giants just pulled ahead with another touchdown.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.080]   I think it might be all over.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.080]   Uh oh.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.080]   Uh oh.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   Oh, I would love to see that.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.080]   Sports is not the game.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.080]   I would love to see that.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.080]   That's not the game.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.720]   That means the Niners will be playing at home.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720]   If the Giants win the Niners play it all.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.760]   Literally that is not the kind of game we're going to play.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760]   Not those games.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   All right.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.000]   We got 15 more minutes for Twitch than they're going to get out here.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.400]   They have to set up the set.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.040]   We're going to leave the cameras on while you set up though so they can watch.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:19.320]   And if you can't stand it, you can go watch Justin.tv/scamschoolbryon.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:25.160]   This is like Google, except not because I just sent everybody away from our show.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.360]   So I guess it's not like...
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.360]   Very kind of you.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.760]   Well, not with sense people off to length.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760]   That's right.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.760]   That's right.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.760]   That was a brutal flash and Google search all in one place.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.760]   All in one mess.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.520]   Actually, you own wrote an interesting article which I want to talk about, The Surprise of
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:43.200]   the Week, and then we'll get your worst of CES picks as we continue.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.520]   But first a word from freshbooks.com.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.520]   I start...
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.280]   You know, if you're in business for yourself, there's one thing that you hate.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.640]   Invoicing.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.320]   I hated it so much that I didn't do it.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.440]   The problem with not invoicing is then you don't get paid.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.640]   So it's a vicious cycle.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.120]   You want to break this.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.120]   I would sometimes I would invoice six months late and then say, "What is this?
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.760]   They're not going to..."
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.560]   You want what?
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.720]   So this is the thing.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:13.560]   In 2004, Amber MacArthur told me about this company because they were based in Toronto,
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.080]   freshbooks.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.600]   And it changed everything.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.600]   With freshbooks, I uploaded my logo.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.880]   I was able to create invoices online.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.200]   They are emailed to your clients in the PDF form.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.000]   There's a button on the email that says, "Pay now."
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]   And because of that, you know, it turns out your clients don't...
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.160]   It's not that they don't want to pay you.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.160]   It's that they're just like you.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.080]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.880]   So if you make it easy for them, they pay.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.680]   You can even set up automatic invoicing and pain.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.200]   It just happens.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.600]   If you keep track of your time sheets, they have apps for that on the phone or on your
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:52.160]   desktop and it'll import those hours automatically, which makes it much easier to invoice.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.560]   They will send out paper invoices for an additional fee.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560]   That's cool.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.480]   It's free, though, for your first three clients.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.440]   Three and a half million people now since I found freshbooks in 2004 since then three
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.080]   and a half million users at freshbooks.com.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.000]   I want you to go there.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.240]   There's no offer code because it's free for the first three no matter what.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.800]   But do say you heard it on Twitch if they ask.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.600]   I don't know if they're going to ask, but if they do, it's just fantastic.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:21.000]   If you're a small business, if you're in business for yourself, the last thing you want to do
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.560]   is invoicing.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.360]   Even if you have a bookkeeper, I know many bookkeepers who use this.
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.000]   It's so much easier.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.440]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:37.040]   Yes, they will be glad to get you signed up.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:42.160]   If you look at the pricing, it's such a good deal free for the first three.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.840]   Then it's very affordable for additional clients.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.840]   Try it.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.840]   Set up only takes a minute.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.400]   You don't need a credit card, just a company name and email and you get your Fresh Books
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.680]   page started and you're going.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.840]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.640]   O'Malley wrote a surprising post this week.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.600]   You know what's bigger than Google plus?
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   My space.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.320]   Not dead yet.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.480]   But it is dead, isn't it?
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.480]   Isn't it home?
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.280]   It's come drinking dead.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.240]   It's April Fool's.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.720]   I mean, really, what is the turnaround strategy?
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.880]   Now Justin Timberlake is one turnaround strategy.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.880]   He's with a C.S.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:23.880]   He was a C.S.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   Push in this.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.920]   Well, Com's course says they're not dead at least in the U.S.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.440]   Which is, you know, pretty, it was pretty surprising to me.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.440]   That's why I just, I did a tiny little blog post.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.200]   And of course now it's living on, right?
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.400]   Like, I didn't really think it was, people really cared now that we moved on to bigger
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.400]   things.
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.360]   But apparently people still care about my space.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:54.200]   I think what I do think there's a lot of music acts which have my space pages and people
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.200]   who follow them.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.640]   And I think that's what is keeping the side going.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:05.120]   Now, the interesting part is that the average time spent is just negligible compared to
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:10.480]   Facebook and Tumblr and some of the others, even Twitter.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:13.760]   And so it's not really doing that from that perspective.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.320]   So it is people using it as like, you know how geo-situent, you know, geo-situent is
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.440]   doing go away for a very long time.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.440]   Right.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.840]   I think that's what we're seeing in this one.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.480]   Twenty, almost 25 million uniques a month.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480]   That's pretty good.
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.040]   And I hope, you know, you know, there's a surprise on this picture on this chart is Pinterest.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.480]   So you've got Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, Tumblr, Google+, and Pinterest.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.480]   What?
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.200]   Yeah, Pinterest is a new new thing.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.480]   It's not even public yet.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.120]   You still have to get an invite, don't you?
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.240]   Well, if it's good for Martha Stewart, it's good for a lot of people.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.640]   Oh, is that Martha?
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.640]   Is that what's going on?
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.640]   Is Martha Stewart?
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.280]   No, it is on Martha Stewart dot com.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.360]   So that's where they got to be.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.880]   So I haven't invited, so there's an iPhone app.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.880]   There's a website.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.840]   And the idea, and I frankly, I don't find this compelling in the least, is you just kind
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.960]   of bookmark stuff and you put it in categories and I don't get it.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.480]   So, you know, the way to think about Pinterest is this is like, you know, how people go
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.640]   window shopping in the real world.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.600]   This is window shopping in the online world.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.600]   That's how I see it.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.920]   Like, a lot of it is aspirational.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.120]   People want to buy these things.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.840]   But it's also very interesting tool to kind of create, you know, pens or, you know, create
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.960]   collections of things you like.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.640]   You know, a lot of people I know who are using it are just completely addictive.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.640]   Really?
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   Oh, that's a nice one.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640]   It just didn't grab me at all.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.640]   Very addictive.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.640]   Really.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.640]   So, all right.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:51.080]   You should try it and say, create like a Leo's, you know, pen for all crazy things you saw.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.640]   You know, actually, yeah.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.360]   It is very Martha Stewart-y.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360]   Pretty photograph.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.920]   Well, it's very photo focused.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.320]   One thing I don't like is they call people who use Pinterest "penners."
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.400]   You know that that is slang for a very, very thin joint, right?
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   Really?
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.400]   Marijuana cigarette, right?
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:11.400]   Now you tell me.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.080]   Well, I can see the finance.
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.580]   I can see the business model here because you can do things like search for gifts from
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.180]   50 to $100.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.920]   And people apparently have pinned these things.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.880]   And now I'm seeing all these are all gifts in that price range.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:34.720]   So if I guess if I'm a husband who has been thrown out of the house, I could just buy
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:39.480]   this spotlight bracelet for $95 and my life would change.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:47.640]   So I heard from somebody who was in the business of selling things and they said that Pinterest
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.760]   was driving more sales and more traffic to them than any of the other services right
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.760]   now.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:59.240]   Well, it stuns me to see that those numbers on that com score chart because it's not even
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.240]   public.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.480]   And it's an invite.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:06.160]   You have to request an invite and it's already like one, two, three, four, five, number seven
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.000]   right after Google+.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.880]   It's at 88 average minutes per visitor.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.160]   So I wrote about them a little while ago, maybe earlier this week or last week I can't
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160]   remember.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.720]   But it was essentially talking about what's going on.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:25.880]   And, you know, as I said, you know, earlier that we are beginning to mimic a lot of offline
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:32.160]   behavior online and Pinterest is just that I, my argument about Pinterest was that, you
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:40.120]   know, when I was younger, all my, you know, friends or lady friends and all, they would
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:46.400]   create like collages and, you know, from the things they would rip out of work and cosmopolitan
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   and all those kind of.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.400]   So it's a lady thing.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.960]   Well, it's very popular with the ladies.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:54.320]   Even the guys use it, but it's really popular with the ladies.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320]   Interesting.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:57.160]   And it's like driving commerce now.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:02.640]   It's like it's, you know, and it's only going to get bigger just making sure Facebook has
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:06.800]   just added a new feature called listen with friends.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:11.120]   If a friend is listening to a song, you can listen to the same song exactly at the same
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.680]   time as they do.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:13.680]   Low, low E.G.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:18.720]   LaMers listening to bitch please featuring exhibit by Snoop Dogg.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.320]   And if I wish to, I could listen to it with him.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.240]   But if you broadcast it, you might get kicked off the air.
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240]   I choose not to.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:33.720]   Anyway, regardless, it's, they're taking a cue from this service turntable FM.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720]   Right.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.720]   Right.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:40.360]   You know, Facebook, the great, you know, the great place where they take other people's
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.200]   ideas and, you know, told them into mass market.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.200]   Yes.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.000]   And you Facebook is the new Microsoft.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.560]   And that's how I wonder how my space could survive.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.600]   If their whole thing, if music, when Facebook is going big into the music direction as well,
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.200]   you know, I use Spotify.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.520]   It's totally integrated in.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.400]   When I play a Spotify track, all my friends know now they can listen at the same time.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:05.040]   I mean, it's just a, it's, and you then you look at Apple's ping, ping, which is like,
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:08.360]   it's like, how could you go so wrong?
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.520]   And you see why Facebook in fact disconnected from Ping Giants one?
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   All right.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.080]   Do you like that?
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:20.200]   I do like that because what I'm going for is a Super Bowl where brother meets brother
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.880]   like the Civil War.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:22.880]   Mm hmm.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:23.880]   Right.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.880]   And the, and so that's what we're good.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.880]   We're laughing at that.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.880]   That's what we're going for.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.360]   No, it also means, it also means the Niners.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.360]   Hey, Lisa, congratulations.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.720]   The Niners play at home next week.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.960]   So, so our CEO was a major Niners fan gets one more game at Candlestick Park before they
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.400]   shut the whole thing down.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.400]   Just just saying.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.840]   Hey, boy, this has been fun.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:46.840]   I just love you guys.
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:51.320]   And I'm sorry that the way that the information worked out, some of you had something to say
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.360]   about one chunk, but not another.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.080]   But I thought it was a great conversation.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:57.600]   Tim Stevens is editor in chief of Engadget.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:03.920]   He's been, he's been pinning his, uh, interesting, his eyelids up with toothpicks, but you can
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.040]   now let them flop forward and sleep for four days.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.040]   I hope you do.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.040]   Thank you.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.800]   Yeah, I would love to, but unfortunately it's right back to right back the news tomorrow
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.800]   morning.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.400]   So all we gotta get right back to the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.720]   minute you wanted to be a blogger dude.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.920]   I don't know, you know, hey, I have no regrets.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.680]   It was a fantastic week.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:19.680]   No regrets.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.680]   It was amazing.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:21.680]   How many?
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:24.440]   Most Engadget U.S. all the international investors.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.600]   We have representatives from Engadget Spanish and Japanese and Chinese there as well, covering
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.600]   the show live.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.920]   And we had a couple of video crews and the full design team of our distro magnet, the
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.160]   tablet magazine that we have as well was on site.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:39.560]   They did two special editions of distro that week.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.640]   Normally they only do one.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.840]   So they weren't getting much sleep either.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.800]   It was a long week for everybody, but it was, it was great.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.720]   Well it only happens once a year.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.720]   Thank goodness.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.600]   Thank goodness.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.760]   It's really great to have you, Tim.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.760]   I really appreciate the being coming in.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.360]   Larry Maggot, I, we should just have you all the time from CBS news, Larry's world.com.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:06.480]   Uh, as various stu, uh, observer of the technology scene and, um, uh, finder of lost children.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.360]   I have found a lost child.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.960]   I see a lost dog wandering around.
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:10.960]   That's mine.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.960]   Yes.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:12.960]   Okay.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:13.960]   We'll leave that one.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:14.960]   Don't report him to what is it you've, you've been working for a long time with the Center
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.960]   for Missing Experience.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:17.960]   I actually work mostly on their internet safety work.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:18.960]   And I love it.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.560]   The internet contract that you designed for them, all of that stuff.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.560]   Thanks.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:23.560]   Where can people find out more about it?
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.560]   We can find out a lot at safekids.com.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.720]   That's my own site, safekids.com and also connect safely.org, which is a nonprofit that
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.000]   I set up with Ann Collier a couple of years ago.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]   It's very, very important.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000]   Thank you.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.640]   Oh, I forgot your worst of CES.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.640]   Oh, a boom box.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   Don't.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.640]   A $30,000 boom box.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.200]   If you could barely fit it in this studio, I can't remember the vendor.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.360]   I don't even want to think about it.
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.360]   Who needs to?
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.360]   Absolutely nobody.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.360]   The worst.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.520]   Tim Stevens, did you have a moment that was the worst of the crap gadgets articles and
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.960]   pretty good places to start?
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.960]   Yes.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:54.960]   If you scroll down, that's the one.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.960]   The watch your bag.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:56.960]   That's it.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:57.960]   What is that?
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.960]   Go back.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:55:59.960]   Watch your bag.
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:00.960]   Right there.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.880]   That is an alarm clock that is shaped to look like a hand holding a shopping bag.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:06.560]   And it lights up with rainbow colors.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.560]   And that's it.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.560]   That's my favorite crap.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.760]   It all said that people weren't solving real problems.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:13.760]   Yes, there you go.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.760]   All right.
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.960]   It was like you gently with rainbow colors from its bag.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:20.680]   That was found, I believe, deep in the international hall.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.160]   And it's a real gem.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.040]   By the way, our chat mod Dan says that that boom box, the $30,000 boom box is from Beringer.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.680]   It's called the Ainuk.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.160]   And it's not just a boom box, dude.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.960]   You left out the most important part.
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:33.960]   It's an iPod dock.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.960]   It's an iPod dock.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.960]   It has all that it is.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:36.960]   It has no input.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   It has no input.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.960]   It's just a giant massive six foot wide thing with a tiny little iPod dock on top.
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:42.960]   It has no input.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.640]   There's nothing else.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.640]   It's it.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.640]   Just an iPod dock.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.640]   Excess.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.640]   It's the impodiment of the iPod.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]   It comes as a truck by the way.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640]   Oh my God.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:55.280]   Oh, Malek doesn't know what the worst of CES was because he thinks it's all crap.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.760]   Oh, you know, don't put words in my mouth.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.880]   But the sentiment is pretty clear though.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:08.480]   Though I do see in the chatroom somebody said that there should be a show called Geech
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:15.000]   of a certain age, I think with Larry, you know, Dvorak, you probably me in about two
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.040]   years, we should do that show.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:23.960]   Oh, you know, last week we did Jerry Pournell, John C. Dvorak and Dwight Silverman and me.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.920]   And so it was the Silver-haired quad drooples.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.380]   We you know, in fact, I kind of afraid that Twitt's going to get a reputation as being
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.680]   for older folks.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.560]   So that's why we're going to bring out two young people in a moment.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:41.680]   They're really, really great kids who have done such a great job entertaining us.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:43.960]   We're going to have the game on shows about to premiere.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.720]   Oh, Malek is at gigahome.com.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:47.560]   Great to have you always.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.360]   You once called me the Yoda of Tech.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.600]   You, my friend, are the Yoda of Tech.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.960]   Well, I don't know.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.440]   I would take that for me.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.080]   You're the man.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:59.560]   I think all of us who are watching Twitt right now would agree to that.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560]   You're very kind.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.760]   But truthfully, I think you're one of the smartest best analysts out there.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.760]   We love having you on.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.080]   I really appreciate your coming by.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.080]   Thank you.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:08.080]   Thank you, all Malek.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.320]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.

[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.240]   up in minutes.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:41.240]   Another Twitt.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.240]   This is amazing.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:42.240]   [music]
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:51.280]   [music]
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.860]   (upbeat music)
