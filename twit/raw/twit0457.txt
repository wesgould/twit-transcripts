[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.760]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.160]   First hello to John C. de Vorac.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   Hello.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.360]   Who's stressing down once again.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.240]   You're getting worse and worse.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.520]   You look like you just woke up.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   I did.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   Are you wearing jammies?
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   I got these things.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.680]   It's kind of a quasi-old man hipster look.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   You're doing that now.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   Hey.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280]   Hey, I like you kids.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   John is my...
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.480]   I'm touching him and he's leaning away.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.000]   John is my old old buddy.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   Guy who got me started in this business.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   I owe you.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   Yeah, you do.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   I do.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   You can write a check.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   I will.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   Also with his Matthew Ingram just back from Perugia and New Orleans.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   From Giga.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   Oh.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   What is his deal?
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.160]   You guys had a conference in Italy and then had a conference in New Orleans?
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.880]   Actually the one in Italy was put on by someone else.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   It's the International Journalism Festival.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   Ah, fun.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.400]   And then we had a gig home editorial offsite in New Orleans.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.800]   On the way back.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   On the way back.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.040]   God, how do I get invited to the International Journalists Go Forum?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   That sounds smart.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   That's a good word for you.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   I would.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040]   Perugia is a medieval city.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.400]   Isn't it the oldest university in Perugia?
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   Medieval university?
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.760]   It's one of the oldest.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   It's certainly pretty old.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.400]   I mean it was the capital of the Etruscan Empire.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.200]   So that's pretty old.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   Well, you don't get better than that.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.880]   Hey, I want to welcome Dan Gilmore back to the show.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.040]   I think the last time Dan was on was many moons ago.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.440]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.080]   Dan was a...
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.000]   For a long time at the San Jose Mercury News he left to create citizen journalism.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.280]   As we know it, he is a technology writer, director of the Knight Center for Digital Media
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.200]   Entrepreneurship at the Cronkite School of Journalism at ASU, and writes a regular
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.920]   column on the Guardian which I find increasingly I turn to because you really seem to do a
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.040]   very good job of boiling this stuff down.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   You're kind to say so.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   No.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520]   It's a lot of fun to be back in the journalism thing.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.360]   The journalism thing that we love so well.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   I was, by the way, I was over in Peruja as well.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   Oh, man.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.280]   So we'll both put in a word for you.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.680]   Was it wonderful?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.960]   It's an amazing conference.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Absolutely amazing.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.040]   Yeah, that sounds like a good conference actually.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   It's incredible.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.720]   So let's talk.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.920]   We can start off with the FCC.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.600]   We've been talking about net neutrality now for a couple of weeks.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   These days the day that we will finally see whatever these proposed rules are.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:49.840]   It was leaked to the Financial Times apparently who wrote a couple of weeks ago, "Oh my God,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.160]   the end of the world is nigh.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:00.040]   The FCC is going to allow carriers, broadband carriers to charge for access to their customers."
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   In other words, charge edge providers like me, like Netflix.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.520]   You're an edge provider?
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.480]   Anybody who provides content over the internet, you're an edge provider and you're an edge
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.400]   provider and you and you and you and you.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.720]   And of course, the world went, "What?"
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.000]   And there's Alexis O'Haines raising money to put a billboard outside the FCC.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.920]   I called Tom Wheeler a troll.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.240]   I mean, it's just, but the truth is we haven't seen the rules, right, Dan?
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.560]   Or do we know what the rules are going to be?
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.200]   Well, we know pretty much what they're going to be.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   And it's a proposal, it's not official rules yet, but they're in the process of, if it
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.240]   happens the way Wheeler wants, then there will in fact be a slow lane and a fast lane
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.520]   on the internet and it would be pretty damaging.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   The rule, what's going to happen Wednesday is the commission as a whole will see these
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.040]   proposed rules for the first time, vote to open a period of public comment.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.520]   I think it's a total of 90 days of public comment, 60 and 30, and then vote on the rules.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.560]   This is in response and stop me, anybody, if I'm saying this wrong.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.480]   I'm doing my best, but this is, A, it's technical.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.000]   So you have to have some technical expertise and a lot of the commentators I've read who
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.240]   understand the politics of it don't understand the technology and vice versa.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.160]   So you've got to understand the politics of it and the legal ramifications of it and
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.520]   the technology of it.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.760]   But this is my understanding.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.560]   The FCC proposed internet rules, Verizon challenged them in court and won.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.400]   And the court, the court said is you don't have a mandate from Congress under the Telecommunications
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.520]   Act to tell internet service providers what to do.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.080]   The court said, come back, they said we are, we reckon, in effect in the opinion, we recognize
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.640]   open internet, a free internet is important, but you just don't have the legal authority
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   to do this.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.520]   You don't have, you don't have jurisdiction.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.240]   Come back and try again.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.720]   And there are a couple of approaches.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.920]   One, the FCC can rewrite the rules under the framework proposed under Title 3 of the
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.480]   Telecommunications Act, Section 706, or, and a lot of people are suggesting they should
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.920]   do this, they can use Title 2, they can declare the broadband providers a common carrier,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.720]   like a telco, and say, hey, you're a common carrier, now we're in charge.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.920]   We regularly, FCC regulates common carriers.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.280]   We can say we didn't want the FCC or the government in wealth in the internet.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.760]   But now all of a sudden we do.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   No, well, see, this is, and I agree, this is part of the conundrum of this is certainly
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.040]   government regulation, the internet is a, everybody agrees a bad idea.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   But it's going to happen.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.200]   The way it is headed and the way you guys are.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.480]   Well, I don't even know that actually promoting it.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.760]   The government set up a situation in the United States that is pretty bad with a really strong
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   lack of competition.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.680]   They basically gave monopolies to cable companies.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.480]   They created Duapolis in most areas where you have two possible providers, your phone
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.920]   and your cable company.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   There's not a lot of competition.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.000]   The lack of competition means you can't go anywhere if you don't like what your cable
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   is doing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Right, you're stuck.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.840]   And the local governments can't do much about it because there's certain regulations
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   that were put in place.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.600]   Now we had a very good this week in law on Friday and I was listening very carefully
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   to it.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.840]   And a couple of things came up.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   First of all, some of the panelists on the show believed that Tom Wheeler was not the
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.200]   devil incarnate who knew, did not represent the interests of the cable companies and the
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.680]   wireless companies, both of which he's worked for in the past as a lobbyist.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.160]   But in fact, was trying to do the best he could without going title two.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.800]   And the panel felt that the title two rules were really draconian and start to regulate
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.440]   the internet like broadband providers like common carriers and it is a nightmare.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.640]   In fact, that was AT&T's opinion.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.480]   This week AT&T said, oh, no title two.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.440]   That's going to kill the internet.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.640]   Dan, maybe can you cut?
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.280]   Have I said anything wrong at this point?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.520]   And can you cut through this a little bit?
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:09.200]   Well, I'm equally concerned about the idea of going to the common carrier rules without
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.360]   thinking through really carefully what that means.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.160]   And it could all go wrong if they do that.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:24.800]   However, as John pointed out himself, what we have now is effectively a duopoly or really
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:33.600]   a monopoly in the places where either Verizon has fiber or Comcast or the cable companies
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.400]   pretty much everywhere else.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   If you want to have even decent speed.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   And we've seen that these carriers simply are going to insist on the right to decide
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.360]   what bits get delivered, where, at what speed, whether they get there at all.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.680]   And that's just not acceptable.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.120]   It would common carrier notion means that they have to do their best.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:05.920]   And you also pointed out, and this is right, that the lack of competition for what we laughingly
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.960]   call broadband in this country, which isn't really broadband.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.320]   The lack of competition comes from the fact that the government starting with Congress
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.840]   basically gave these companies control.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.000]   And here we are, what people have been predicting for more than a decade is starting to come
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   true.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.160]   And Title II is awful, but it's probably less awful than letting the cable companies run
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   rush shot and the telecoms run rush shot.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   And keep in mind that with wireless, mobile, it's already over.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.480]   No one's even contesting that they're going to control that stuff.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.360]   So this is really close to being over.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.240]   Well, actually, why don't people complain about that more?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.160]   That the wireless thing, there's no equal bits, equal packets for everybody on wireless.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.720]   Even Google is in bed with Verizon on this one.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   And they said, well, we understand that wireless has, and I think this is true, wireless is
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.960]   very difficult, different technical considerations.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.560]   And wireless shouldn't have to be, at least at this point, neutral.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   It's not going back.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   It should be.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   You're not going backwards.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.520]   I don't understand why we accept this for wireless either.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.560]   Yes, they have different issues, but if it's a matter of capacity, then charge people on
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.160]   how much they use, but the people out at the edge of the network should be making the
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.000]   choices, not the people in the center.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.320]   And inexorably, we're moving toward the people in the center deciding for us.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.520]   Really, the real problem.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.040]   In conjunction with their partners that are really big companies in other respects.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.800]   No, but I don't want government involvement in the internet, but I also don't trust Comcast
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   as far as I can throw them.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.960]   And all of these companies, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, their job, their mandate is to maximize profits.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.760]   I love Comcast.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   They don't have.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   They don't know.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.320]   I can't use it for podcasting.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   Why not?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   Because we have jitter.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   It's weird.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   Well, what a surprise.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.720]   I mean, that's the other problem is that these companies are all in the television business.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.760]   They're all, Comcast not only owns.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   They're NBC.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.680]   It's also provides content, premium content over the wire, and they have telephony.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.640]   So all of these companies are in direct competition with the free internet services.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   This is all monopoly stuff.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   It's a mess.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.440]   But that's the real problem to me as far as I'm concerned.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.080]   So there is a way out, but we're not going to get there with the current people in charge.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.760]   The way out is to do what the what other countries have done in many cases.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.320]   It was just to say to the people who have these monopolies or at most do-oppoles on
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:58.840]   the pipes say, okay, you have to lease capacity to competing ISPs at an imputed cost.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.800]   It's roughly what you pay now.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.720]   And that doesn't fix it instantly, but that's what we have to do or we're just not going
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   to get there.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.040]   I loved your article in the Guardian.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.120]   The FCC is about to axe murder net neutrality.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.520]   But your advice is don't get mad, get even and you suggest.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   And I think I agree.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   I think this-
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   Can I guess what he says?
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   I didn't read this.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   How would you get even?
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   Get off the internet now.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.280]   And then, take your cable subscription though.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.960]   He said, that's getting-
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   Or I'll stop practical.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   There's no reason for us.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   I'm signing off right now.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   No, we have no net.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   We can-
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.280]   You just put me out of business.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.580]   You're not out of business.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580]   Without the internet.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.320]   Okay, you can find something else to do.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   You've got-
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.680]   You make most of your money from the radio show anyway that's indicated.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.920]   You make a fortune on that thing.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   You can still do that.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   You're such a disturbing.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.720]   I'm just saying.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   You recommend and I think this is a good solution.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.280]   Community internet movement, I think that's a really good movement.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.560]   If you don't like the internet, build your own.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.120]   Community broadband networks own and operate it for the public.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   You say, waiting for Google fiber.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   You might as well wait to win the lottery.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.160]   Google's not your daddy or your savior.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.760]   You got that right.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   Yeah, and then call Congress.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.720]   See, I talked to John Perry Barlow about this a couple of years ago.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.600]   He's of course founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and on the board.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.200]   He said even among the board members of the EFF were divided.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.040]   Some of us understand that government regulation would be a terrible thing in any regard.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.200]   Others say, well, but there's no other solution at this point.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   Matthew Ingram help us.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   Cut the Gordian knot.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   What do we do?
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   It's your fault.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   Wow.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   Yeah, you're Canadian.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   He's Canadian.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   He doesn't care.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.720]   You don't, you can say whatever you want.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   Hey, Canada.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   Stop it.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   I do.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.280]   I do the only sort of rational argument that I've heard for why making the cable carriers,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.400]   common carriers, wouldn't be a good idea.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.680]   Came from Mark Andreessen, who I had a sort of back and forth with along with a bunch
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   of other people on Twitter about when this first came up and when they lost the ability
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   to regulate.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.320]   Everyone is saying, well, make them common carriers.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.880]   His argument was if we want to have the internet get faster and faster and faster and more
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:26.040]   and more bandwidth so we can do virtual reality or so we can do telepresence and we can do
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.720]   all these amazing things, education and so on over the internet, then we need investment
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.160]   in the infrastructure.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.920]   And his point was if we make cable companies, common carriers, they lose the incentive to
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.640]   invest or over invest in the kind of infrastructure that we need.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.040]   I know I'm not saying I believe him, but that was the sort of nub of his argument that,
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.920]   and he didn't really know how to prevent them from doing the things we want to prevent
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.360]   them from doing either.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.760]   But his point was if you just legislate that they are common carriers, they will presumably
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.200]   lose the incentive to invest as much as they have.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.040]   This is why it's so damn complicated.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   I don't know if there's a golden or silver bullet on this.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.440]   I really don't.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.360]   The more I learn, the more in transit, intractable it seems, frankly.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.680]   Well, you know, if this country had common sense, which I'm afraid we don't anymore,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:32.880]   we would look at this the way we looked at the interstate highway system in the 1950s,
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.200]   a public works project that is essential, that we the taxpayers should pay for.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   We should put dark fiber everywhere, essentially, as taxpayers.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.080]   We should put it there and then light private industry light it up.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.400]   Again, I don't see us doing it.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.120]   I think there's been a conscious decision made by the government to get in bed with the telecoms
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.040]   and to control our communications.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.160]   And I don't think that's not conspiracy, it's just reality.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   I think there is a lot.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.520]   Another thing that Mark and others have mentioned is that there's a lot the FCC and
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.680]   the government could do in terms of helping regions or towns or cities, you know, provide
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.000]   their own high speed access.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.720]   And some of that is freeing up on license spectrum, you know, forcing carriers to give
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.640]   up spectrum they're not using.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.760]   So that then you can, you know, those different like smaller areas can create their own effectively
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.280]   Google fiber or their own ISP and provide some competition.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.080]   Great post on the level three's blog, Observations of an Internet Middleman.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.440]   This is Mark Taylor writing and he really kind of lets you know that these big broadband
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.960]   providers are not looking out for our best interest.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.280]   Level three is kind of an Internet middleman, they own backbones, they make deals with other
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.400]   networks to provide access to the Internet.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.800]   Most of these deals are peering what we call peering relationships.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.400]   Mutual agreements that have gone on since the beginning of the Internet often handshake
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   deals between engineers saying, hey, we'll direct connect to you if you'll direct connect
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.720]   us.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.800]   Sometimes those relationships are asymmetric.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   One user sends more data over the network than the others in those cases.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.760]   Maybe there's payment and so forth.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.720]   But he says typically in these agreements, the way it works is everybody's responsible
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.480]   for fixing congestion.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.080]   If all of a sudden the way people use the Internet changes and there's a lot of congestion on
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.160]   a particular route or router, they beef it up.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.560]   That's normal.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   So he mentions that level three and by the way, these are real numbers and that's one
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.680]   of the nice things about this is that this is somebody who's right there in the middle.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.720]   Level three has 51 peers like that.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.040]   They are interconnected in 45 cities, 1,360 10 gigabit ethernet ports.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.880]   That's capacity of 13.6 gigabits, 13.6 thousand gigabits per second.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880]   13 terabytes.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.800]   13 terabytes per second per second.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.680]   And the average number of interconnection cities per peer is five.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:23.400]   So he shows a normal situation where this is 100 gigabit port in Washington, DC, a peer
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   connection without congestion.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.680]   That's the bottom graph here.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.560]   And you see these spikes of usage, but there's no congestion.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   All the packets get through.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.640]   In fact, the bottom right graph shows zero packet loss.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.320]   Look at the top line.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:46.240]   This is a connection with one of the five major broadband providers in this country.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   It is congested.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.040]   So you see that the top, the peaks of the graph are cut off and you see the packet loss significant.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.160]   I mean, at the point where the port is so congested that it is unusable.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.280]   And he says all six are large broadband consumer networks with a dominant or exclusive market
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.160]   share in their local market.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.560]   And interestingly enough, they're all dead last in customer satisfaction.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.880]   For that reason.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.360]   So you can triangulate on that one pretty quickly.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   Exactly.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.840]   Yeah, he doesn't name names.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   These are customers.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   These are deals he doesn't want to.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   Sounds like everybody.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.760]   Basically, yeah, one is in, I think England and Fiverr in the US.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.480]   Basically all the big broadband providers in the US are intentionally letting ports become
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.840]   congested because what they try, it's essentially blackmail to level three and others saying,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.440]   you know what, you gotta give me no fair fact that this is intentional.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.520]   Or they're just, well, they're asking, they're demanding money.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   It's a heck of a coincidence.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.800]   Well, they're coming to level three saying you need to pay us or we're going to keep
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   those congested.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   They did this to Netflix.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:58.400]   They said your Netflix internet connectivity went down on Comcast 38% since last October.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.320]   And that's basically Comcast saying, you know what, you're sending a lot of traffic.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.760]   They wanted better peering Comcast or Netflix than this.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   So they did a deal.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.040]   Well, Netflix did a deal, but they're not happy about it.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.360]   Reed Hastings has published that, you know, in the Netflix blog that he was felt he was
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   blackmailing.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.120]   And by the way, now it's Verizon and AT&T are coming to Netflix.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.960]   Same thing, hat and hand saying, if you would like for full access to our subscribers, you
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.800]   would be behoove you to pay us a little money.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.440]   I think this would all be solved by a fast lane.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   What's a fast lane?
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   I don't know.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.440]   That's a Gilmore state.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.440]   HOV.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.400]   You need two people watching Netflix or three, depending if you're in the Bay Area is three,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.200]   or you can't get on and watch it.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.600]   We always usually watch with two.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.400]   I feel like we should be able to cut through this and explain it.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.600]   And I don't feel like we know.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.360]   Vihart has done a great video.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   Have you seen Vihart's video?
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.720]   I think the thing, who is the guys who said that we should have it more like a public
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   utility?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   That was Dan's position.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   I agree.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   Oh, you do?
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.320]   Oh, that's funny because at least two years ago I went on and on about how we should meter
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.680]   the internet like a public utility, and oh, we can't meter the internet, but that's what
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.280]   they do with public utilities.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.000]   So why don't we meter the internet?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.320]   No, my position was you can meter it, but there is plenty of bandwidth.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.680]   If in fact we did what Dan's suggesting, which is laid fiber across this country that's
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.960]   owned by the government, lease it out to people, there would be true competition.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.200]   The highway system would be preserved.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.720]   I truly don't mind paying for more speed.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   I'm not talking about metering.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.280]   We're talking about equal access to customers for edge providers.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.640]   What's been with caps?
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.440]   Yeah, bandwidth caps effectively.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.240]   This guy then, the chat, who says they meter the interstate?
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.880]   No, they meter utilities, water, electricity, and low.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.520]   We want to be like the interstate.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.120]   They don't meter the highway.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   Well they do.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.880]   In some places they have toll roads.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   Right.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   We don't want a toll road.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.640]   Well, maybe we do.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.320]   I would rather go with the metering the internet.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.040]   I've said this for years.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.160]   I'm not sure I really understand what you're talking about.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.640]   You pay for your bits.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   You buy a million bits.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   You pay for a million bits.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   You buy one bit.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   You pay for one bit.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.240]   That's fine as long as all bits are equal.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.560]   It's fine with me.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.680]   They would be equal because you're paying for them.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.840]   Well, that's not what these companies want.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.400]   I think it is.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Go ahead.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.240]   The risk is not for Netflix.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   You know, Netflix.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   They can afford it.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   Right.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   They can afford it.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.600]   The risk is that you have smaller content companies and smaller providers who can't afford
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   to pay for the fast lane.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.120]   Their content gets slowed down.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.280]   That's a risk not just for people who want to watch TV programs.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.880]   That's a risk for the free flow of information period.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   Right.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.720]   By the way, a quarter million people have watched Vihart's video on net neutrality.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   I recommend.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.920]   I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.360]   It's on YouTube if you look for VI, HART and net neutrality.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.240]   I think it's an analogy that is perhaps a little strange.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.400]   She describes the internet service providers like delivery trucks.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.120]   But I think the gist of it is exactly the delivery truck that costs money.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.680]   Nobody's saying it doesn't cost money, John.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   Nobody's saying that.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   I know.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   I want Comcast to make money.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.240]   I'm not saying don't make money Comcast.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   I'm not a commie.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.040]   I think that was a market.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   A commie.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   What?
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Go ahead.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.680]   Mark Hendrickson used the truck analogy too and said, you know, if Netflix, if Netflix
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.240]   trucks were using up 80% of the highway system.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   Okay.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   So that's BS.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.840]   So, and this is why Vihart describes this.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   That's BS.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.960]   This is one of those drawing things.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.240]   She does a good job actually and I highly recommend it.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   It is a drawing thing.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   I hate those.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.400]   You know the other way to stop.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.000]   The other thing I hate besides these drawing things is that you ever will turn out and
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   you're like, oh, watch this video.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.040]   And it's just a bunch of words coming at you.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.240]   It's like you're reading it slow motion.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.480]   This is a poor man's or woman's way of illustrating what she's talking about and she does quite
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   a good job.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   It's actually a good artist.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.720]   I've gone mad.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   You're not like drawings, John?
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.400]   John doesn't like life.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   No, I love life.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.120]   This is crap I don't like.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.440]   This is actually, you should listen to this very good.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:19.480]   So her point is, look, you're already paying for delivery of these packages via this truck.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:25.800]   It's as if UPS said, oh, Amazon, you're sending us so much business that we want you to pay
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.160]   as well as the customer.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.040]   The delivery is already paid for.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.480]   They're double dipping going to Amazon saying, if you would like to reach our customers,
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.040]   you should, because you're sending so much business to us.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.760]   And Amazon should say, well, that's good, isn't it?
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.240]   Wow, that's the most specious thing you've ever said.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   Really, why is that specious?
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.400]   Well, for one thing, half the time you're not paying for Amazon, it's always free.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.240]   And the second thing is Amazon does pay them to ship the stuff.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.400]   And Amazon, if they want more--
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   Well, somebody pays you either.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   Give me your Amazon.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   But the point is, once more money--
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   To ask for charge.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.280]   --more money and they do that commonly, charge more.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.400]   The post office does it.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   They keep raising the rates.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Oh, that's fine.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   If it's cool.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.760]   Actually, John, there's a discount for volume in shipping.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   No, that's true.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760]   In fact, they pay less.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   The customer is paying for the shipment from Amazon.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   It's what Amazon is paying for.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   It's the customer.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   Right.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   John's very confused.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   No, I'm not confused.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   Amazon writes the check.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   Well, they do because I pay them for price.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   And if they rack--
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   But at the end of the day, the customer pays.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.760]   I agree with you.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.760]   Yes.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   It's true.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   Yes.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   It's as if they said, if UPS said, both parties should pay.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   That's what basically Comcast wants to do.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   They want Amazon and you to pay.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   That's what you think.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   If they're what they say is, because you're sending us so much business.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   Well, I think--
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.840]   But you've got to take Gilmore's point into account, which is that they actually give
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.760]   them a discount for all that extra business, which is the reality.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:58.600]   If there was one shipper that Amazon could use for any given community, only one was
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.920]   allowed to serve that community, things would be really different.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.560]   It would be a lot worse for everybody except for that shipper.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.720]   I think we all agree that if there were real competition in internet service, this wouldn't--
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   we wouldn't have to worry about it.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.120]   And by the way, this common carrier idea, this was going on with the phone companies
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   for a while.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   And if you remember in the--
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   The Carter phone.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.920]   --the mid-late '90s when they had North Point communications and all these other guys, and
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.000]   they were running through the AT&T switches or the Pac Bell switches, you'd lose the connection
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.480]   commonly because every once in a while, some guy would be in the office, Jeremy, so, oh,
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.240]   there's that North Point thing, let's pull it out.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.800]   And they were always playing dirty.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.920]   And these guys would play dirty too, so that idea is never going to fly.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   Huge coalition led--
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   Go ahead.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   How did-- look, how did the internet get popular in the first place?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.080]   It was because it was on the telephone network.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.320]   It was on a common carrier network.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.080]   Which was a common carrier network.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   Right, yes.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.480]   And there were a bazillion competing ISPs.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.000]   That's one of the reasons the internet got huge quickly in this country.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.680]   Because the phone company, which was then the carrier monopoly, said, was not allowed
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.400]   to discriminate.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   That's why we had internet--
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.360]   There's one thing the FCC could do right now that, in fact, I think would work.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:22.240]   They've required telcos to allow third-party DSL providers to sit on the telco networks.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.480]   They never did that with cable providers.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.960]   If you have Comcast in your-- if Comcast built the plant, Comcast is your provider, no other
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.760]   company can ride that cable.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   If they said--
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   That's why you saw it.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   As they did with DSL--
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   That's why you saw it.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   That's why you saw it.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.760]   Your buddy.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.680]   Yeah, if they did with DSL, SonicNet can ride on AT&T's wires into my house.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.760]   If they did that with cable and said, "Hey, SonicNet, would you like to be an ISP on top
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.520]   of Comcast's cable?"
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   They could do that right now.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.880]   They did it with DSL.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   That would change things.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.080]   That would provide competition.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.240]   Is that what you recommend?
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   Yes.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   Okay, we're done.

[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   We're done.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   We're done.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.240]   We're done.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240]   We're done.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:19.520]   What I was really curious about is I think it's inevitable that Oracle has done its share
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.240]   of what it has sued Google about.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.480]   That's a good point.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:32.080]   I'd kind of like to see a list of the APIs that Oracle by its standard has been stealing
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   over the years.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.160]   I bet there are quite a few.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.240]   Of course, Google says it will appeal.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.120]   The first thing it'll do is go back to the lower court and see if they can rewrite it
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   and get the lower court to -- you get the higher court to approve it.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.280]   But ultimately, I think you're right.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.400]   I think this is going to the Supreme Court.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   There is hope there.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.280]   Although, frankly, with the Supreme Court we have, I feel like it's unpredictable.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.320]   You never know what they're going to do.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.600]   But Dan, you say that they are -- this is the kind of thing they might well overturn.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.400]   Well, it's another case of Congress not doing its job.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.080]   So we have to wait for the Supreme Court to do Congress's job.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.560]   In this particular instance, since it's a highly technical issue, I don't see the Supreme
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.280]   Court even being able to figure out this.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.600]   I don't care who explains it to him.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   Well, it's easy.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.100]   Let me explain.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.480]   And I'll read this is from the judgment to use the district court's example.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.120]   One of the Java API packages that issue is Java.lang.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.920]   Within that package is a class called Math.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.640]   And in Math, there are several methods, including one that's designed to find the larger of
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   two numbers.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.080]   We'll call it Max.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.480]   The declaration for the Max method is defined for integers is public static and Max parenthesis
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.560]   in X and Y, where the word public, very important means that the method is generally accessible.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.440]   That they're publishing it, in effect.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.320]   Static means that no specific instance of the class is needed to call the method.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.800]   The first one indicates that the method returns an integer.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.080]   It exits Y are two numbers, inputs being compared.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   And I think any illiterate person could understand what I'm saying.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   They'll figure that out.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   No problem.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.760]   The programmer calls the Max method by typing the name of the method, M-A-X, and providing
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.080]   X and Y.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:24.240]   The expressions used command the computer to execute the implementing code that carries
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.760]   out the operation of returning the larger.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.520]   Yeah, but they'll have that down.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   Right.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.320]   I like to hear the questions they have about this.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.680]   So the issue is...
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.120]   What if it's Y?
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   Right.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:41.720]   Does Oracle own the words Max, X, and Y?
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720]   Because they say they do.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.120]   I think Scalia would have something to say about this.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.440]   Yeah, when is Wopner on maybe?
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440]   I don't know.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Wopner.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.160]   There's a call back for you.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160]   Wopner.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   I can't.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   It's from Wopner.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.160]   15 years ago.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.520]   But you got it?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   I know all these references.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   Got it.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   Time for Wopner.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:10.720]   Google believed, what a shock, that Java programmers would want to find the same 37
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:16.360]   sets of functionalities in the new Android system, callable by the same names, Max as
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.680]   example, as using the Java.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.200]   That seems reasonable.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.080]   That's why we have an API.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080]   There you go.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.840]   Oh, well, I don't...
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840]   You know...
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   Well, this story went nowhere.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   I don't want to say anything.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.280]   I was saying to say the sky is falling, but I think the sky is falling.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.480]   Well, it's not a good thing.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   Let's put it that way.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.400]   But there's nothing to discuss.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.080]   There's nothing to discuss because there will be appeal, and of course it's not so.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.080]   It's not final.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.240]   So the sky is not falling.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240]   It could.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.240]   It could fall.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   It could always fall.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   That's always fall.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.000]   In the near future, the sky could fall.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.480]   Google's trying to sell Google Glass at a golf tournament.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.680]   There's something funny about that.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   I'm on about it.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680]   Look out.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   What?
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   What?
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.920]   It's at the Players' Championship.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.800]   Google has a booth.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.720]   There's somebody right there in the booth selling...
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   And now Chad's got...
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   It has to be locked on for way too long.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   What?
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.720]   He loves you.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   He doesn't want to cut away from you.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   He hates me.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.520]   Is this because country club golfers are the only people who can afford it?
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.760]   When you sell in a $1,500 gadget that doesn't really do much, you probably should go to
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760]   the golf.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.320]   It's probably more entertaining than the golf game itself.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.760]   Google has said our hope is to bring Glass to new explorers like optometrists, sports
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.200]   lovers, online retailers, cooks and travelers.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.840]   So we're going to go to places and try to sell this stuff.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.280]   I had the opportunity to buy Glass.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   I did not.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280]   I thought...
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   I gave it.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   Well, I did buy it, technically.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   It's a Jason Howell.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   Okay.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   And you know what?
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.880]   I'm glad I did because Jason Howell's a daughter, Savannah.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.640]   She had just had a baby.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.840]   What are you taking a picture of?
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   What is that?
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   I'm just showing off the thing.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.840]   I never...
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   While I was watching John C. DeVoir, I can still...
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.640]   He is a really attractive man, isn't he?
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.120]   I think flannel suits you, my friend.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.600]   I'm all for the flannel.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.280]   Are you thinking of joining a grunge band?
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.400]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.440]   I'm trying to find real quickly because what Jason did was so...
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.240]   Made me happy that I did buy the Glass and give it to Jason.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.520]   His daughter, Savannah, took her first steps and Jason got it on video via Glass.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.400]   A video he probably would not have had if he hadn't had Glass on.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.560]   So he just wears these 24/7 all the time?
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.480]   And all you have to do is go, Glass, take a movie and...
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   That's a great example.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.640]   I remember when my kids were little and they would start doing something cute and you'd
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.120]   run to get the video camera.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   It's over.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.800]   Which in my day weighed 45 pounds and you had to drag the whole bag and the battery and
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800]   everything.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.960]   By the time we get there, they finish doing whatever was cute.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   Right.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   This is a good quality video too.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.360]   Well, and this, he'll have this forever.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.520]   And I remember Henry's first steps.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   I remember Abby's first steps.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.360]   I don't have a record of it in any way.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.360]   This is awesome.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.360]   It is pretty cool.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.000]   I'm a little skeptical of Glass in general, but this is one case where I think Glass is
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.040]   your recommendation with newborns.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   That's actually why I gave it to him.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   I said, you know what, you have a baby, a newborn baby, you really should have Glass.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.400]   But actually, I could see the golf thing to get back to that news story.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.360]   I could see if you went to a really high end golf course.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.280]   What if they just gave you Glass while you were playing the Red?
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.200]   Just for the nine holes or the 18 holes.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.480]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   And then maybe there's an app built in that tells you how far away you are from the hole
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   or something.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   That you get to keep the video on.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.280]   Stone I got to make it into the hole.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.080]   Chats in love with that shot of the glass.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.320]   That's the fourth time you show.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   He loves that shot.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   I'm telling you, Chad's on something.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.240]   Do you need to get home?
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240]   It's a fresh air jet.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   We love Chad.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.400]   Without Chad Johnson, the show would be nothing.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.640]   He is great.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.200]   According to the next web, Google is testing.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.240]   He goes again with that shot.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   Just a boom, boom.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.000]   He likes to do that to you, Johnny.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   He likes to catch you.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.680]   Somebody will catch you with your finger up your nose.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.240]   I don't do that.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.480]   He's hopped up on goofballs.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   It's okay.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   That's pretty obvious.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.800]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.800]   What's a goofball?
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.280]   A goofball is a combination, I believe, of heroin and meth.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   That's a speedball.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   That's a speedball.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.280]   Oh, a goofball.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.720]   Okay, maybe it's heroin and something, maybe like some downer.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   I don't know.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.120]   What are you asking me for?
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.040]   You can go to the Urban Dictionary and look it up.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.440]   Again with the Urban Dictionary.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.000]   I'll go look it up.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.680]   Apparently, Google is testing a new Gmail interface that is a very simplified interface.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.640]   Focus on mail.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.560]   They've renamed stars to...
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.760]   I have been struggling with Google mail now for some time.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.360]   If you use Gmail in the web interface, it's great.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.040]   But it is a broken implementation of iMap.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   I've been trying like the Dickens to get a Macintosh email client, including Apple's
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.120]   own mail, to work with Gmail.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.680]   Have you tried mailbox?
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.160]   Like mailbox doesn't have some of the things I need.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.960]   I've been using something called mail mate, which is written by a Danish programmer and
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.120]   it's really good.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.560]   But he said, "You know, the problem with iMap on Google is just really weirdly implemented.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.120]   It's not standard at all."
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.600]   Does Thunderbird work with it?
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.320]   Yeah, all these things work okay.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.480]   But they're issues.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.640]   And Apple's mail only started breaking with Mavericks, but it's just not.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.800]   It just adds to my general pain, my frustration with email.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.240]   I thought mailbox was working really well.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.320]   And I was doing really well.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.680]   And then I found out that it was auto archiving to import emails from people.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.760]   So that was awkward.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.160]   It's just very odd.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.880]   So the goofball, goofball, there's no real combination of drugs.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.520]   It's just something that people say.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.920]   I think it's a Letterman thing.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.080]   Well, it's in the urban dictionary, but it's just...
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.720]   Anybody using the hashtag Amazon cart?
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   No.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720]   Who would use this?
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720]   I signed up for it.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.720]   Oh, what do you get out of it?
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.720]   Squat.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.760]   What is this thing with Google and they squat?
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   Squat.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.760]   You can buy stuff quickly.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.480]   What's just Google's got some new shopping thing with same-day delivery?
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480]   Yeah, they're just...
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.480]   What is this all about?
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.680]   They're trying to eat Amazon's lunch.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.200]   I will in a moment.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.680]   But first Amazon cart.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]   Okay.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.000]   So if you find a tweet with an Amazon product link in it.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Oh, this deal.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.680]   And you reply with the hashtag Amazon cart.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.920]   Yeah, they add it to your...
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.440]   They add it to...
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.880]   So what they're basically done is double the tweet count for that item.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.440]   I don't need any help buying things.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   Let's print that one.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   But it's so easy.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   I know.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   It's too easy.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   Do you know how it seems to me...
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   Need things that are harder.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.200]   Why would you buy something based on somebody's tweet?
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.200]   I don't get that.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.200]   Oh, because you're maybe an idiot, I mean...
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   An idiot.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.040]   I like to go to Amazon when I buy something and actually shop a little bit.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.080]   Look at the alternative possibilities.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.840]   Look at the reviews.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.640]   I always read the one-star reviews and see if the guy just doesn't know what he's talking
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   about.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.440]   Well, there's an interesting story about that.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.440]   Okay.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.320]   There is a guy who wrote a negative review of a router.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.200]   Actually, this is kind of...
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.000]   To me, this raises some interesting issues.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.040]   The router is from a company called MediaLink.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.440]   MediaBridge Products took Umbridge at the negative review.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   They do that.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.640]   Threatened to sue the guy for a libel.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.680]   It's got him to change the review.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.560]   Then Amazon weighed in and said, "We are not selling MediaBridge Products."
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.560]   Good for them.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.720]   I hate these companies that do that.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   That's very common.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.760]   You run into some litigious company and they're so thin-skinned.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:11.160]   They expect some Joker, some negative review in an online forum like the Amazon reviews.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.800]   They get so thin skin they sue you, this is not a company that you want to do business
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   with.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Well, okay.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800]   It's not killing them.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   There's...
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.520]   I don't know that negative reviews have that much impact.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.760]   But here's the thing.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.040]   Now I'm going to add the other side of this story.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.520]   Uh-oh.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:38.840]   But the MediaBridge Company said is the review is libelous because he refers to two facts
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.840]   that are not true.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:47.160]   One, he asserts that we are posting reviews, uh, fallacious reviews of our own.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.560]   Which most companies do.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.160]   And two, that the MediaBridge router is a rebranded router from another company.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.120]   Which most routers are.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.000]   The MediaBridge folks said those are both demonstrably not true.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.960]   So they actually hand make this thing themselves.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.960]   They are.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.280]   They are, well I don't know, but they are libelous.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   Okay.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.680]   So they actually have a case for libel.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.800]   And this is one thing that I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:14.160]   If you're a reviewer, you might actually be libeling a company.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160]   If you say something that is...
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.200]   I have a monsterably untrue in the review.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.720]   I've always believed that too.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   Careful.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.880]   Because in fact, lawyers, when queried by ours, technical about this said, you know what?
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   They actually have a case.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.400]   I'm surprised that more people don't get sued.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.360]   Yelpers, for example, they come and they smear some operation because they didn't like
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   them.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.160]   Let's give a little, uh, and you know, we're sitting here with the director of the Cronkite
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   School of Journalism.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.920]   No, not the director.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.200]   The guy who runs the whole place.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   He has the show.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   The director of journalism.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   And not the director of the...
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.760]   The man who invented journalism.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   Yes.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:57.000]   Dan Gilmour, who is the director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.920]   the Cronkite School.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.680]   Tell me what libel is.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.720]   Because you must have been at some point somebody, a J-Schooler somewhere told you,
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.320]   "Here's what you can and cannot do."
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   Well, there's a lot of nuances in libel.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:22.560]   Basically, if you say something or publish something that is defamatory, that injures
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.600]   the reputation of someone else and it's false, that's the key.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.600]   That's the key.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   The false part.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   Because I can...
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.240]   It has to be a monster.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.160]   It has to be a fact.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.160]   There's malicious as part of this problem.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.000]   There's also intent.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.600]   You can be accidentally wrong.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.160]   But if I call John, if I call you a schmuck, you can't sue me because that is a...
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   Less like douchebag.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   That's an opinion.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   That's an opinion.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.560]   But if I say John, you're a patter-assed or you...
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.960]   A crook is a better way.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.600]   If I said you're a crook, that's actually a good one.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.600]   Yeah, I can sue you.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.600]   Because that sounds like a...
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   How is your crook...
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   You're a crook journalist.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.560]   Do not use the word crook because you're asking for trouble.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.240]   That's literally libelous or slanderous depending on the...
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.240]   Or criminal.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   It's always a criminal.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240]   Is he a criminal really?
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.040]   And you know how I found this out?
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040]   I was talking.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:15.360]   I was about patent trolls on the tech TV and I called the guy an extortionist.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.400]   And the lawyers, the NBC, or whoever the lawyers were, I can't do that.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   They said, "That's libelous.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   You take it back."
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.160]   You could call them a virtual extortionist if you had some example.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   I could say it's extortion-like.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.840]   There's a lot of things you could say.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.760]   I could say that it's tantamount to extortion, but I can't say extortion.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760]   Right.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.680]   I remember Penn and Teller saying fraud is bad.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.680]   You should never say that.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.560]   Because then you have to prove it.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.920]   But douchebag or pole dish, those are fine.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.560]   Those are just value judgments.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.560]   Yeah, and douchebag is a real funny one because if you actually sued over that, it'd be a
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560]   great court case.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560]   Can you imagine?
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560]   I am not a douchebag.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560]   This is a douchebag.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560]   Here I am.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.400]   Do I even look like a douchebag?
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   I ask you.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.360]   Well, you look a little like one, but I'm not one.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.880]   No, you're not one, sir.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.880]   You win.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.880]   So anyway, I do like the fact that Amazon stepped up.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.480]   On the other hand, in fact, they might have been kind of in the wrong because this company,
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.920]   MediaLink, the MediaBridge company, really maybe had grounds for sue.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.080]   Yeah, but still, you don't sue it in the drop of a hat.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080]   Right.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.080]   And to some poor guy-
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080]   Well, they sue them.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.680]   By the way, they threaten them, which is worse.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.000]   And the Streisand effect is in place on that company.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.320]   They have now shown themselves to be somebody or a company with a thin skin.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:43.200]   And with serious questions raised about the routers that they're selling, whether-
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   Right.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.320]   I don't know if it's true or false, but it has made me, for two reasons, less likely
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.040]   to buy it because the first one is I don't like companies that sue people for things
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.320]   like this and the other is I don't know much about the router.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   Right.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.720]   So that's good on Amazon.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.800]   Here's one bad on Amazon, Hashette.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   Okay.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.800]   The big publishing.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   Big publishing.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   Big publishing now.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   Yep.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.160]   Among Hashette's authors, Malcolm Gladwell.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.840]   If you go to Amazon.com and you search for the tipping point, lovely book, highly
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:21.000]   recommended, by Malcolm Gladwell, you'll see Amazon says, "Oh yeah, the tipping point,
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.240]   we'll get that to you in two to three weeks."
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.400]   Usually ships in two to three weeks.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.400]   I see that, yes.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   Now, how you-
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.400]   Why is this?
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   That's not true.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   We-
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400]   It's-
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.400]   They have pallets of that book.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   What about prizes?
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.000]   Prime, it should be two days.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   But they don't have-
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   This shit is insane.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Amazon's saying we don't have in stock.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.600]   And apparently they're doing this with a lot of Hashette books.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.640]   I'll tell you, the New York publishers, when you go back and have meetings with any of
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.400]   them, all they do is complain about Amazon pulling these stunts.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   This is like net neutrality, but for books.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.920]   Like Amazon is basically controlling the pipeline for books.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Exactly.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.360]   And they delay the ship.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.880]   So what's the backstory?
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.320]   Why are they doing this?
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   Well, we don't know.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.280]   But apparently there's a dispute with Hashette over pricing, you know, all the time Google.
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.040]   So I mean, Amazon, so what happened when the Amazon first started out?
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.720]   They were- The publishers loved them.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.840]   Oh my God, we have somebody we can go to that won't charge us like orders or Barnes
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.000]   and Noble.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.640]   And then Amazon puts Barnes and Noble out of business, or borders out of business,
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.560]   shrinks Barnes and Noble's presence significantly.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.360]   And then Amazon goes to them and says, "Oh by the way, we're going to take-
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.160]   This is what Tower Records did to- A little more money.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   And so I don't know what's going on, but it seems- I know I can find out.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.000]   It seems likely the Hashette is that Amazon wants a bigger discount from Hashette.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.960]   It would have to do with the e-books because Amazon really only gets defensive when it
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.360]   comes to e-books.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:53.320]   But it's affecting a lot of authors and the authors are pissed because in some cases the
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.600]   discount has disappeared.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.680]   So they're charging full freight, or it's been many cases that's just not available.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.640]   And so it's costing- Who does it cost really?
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.680]   Well, not just Hashette, it costs the authors-
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   Two to three weeks.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   Two to three weeks.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   Two to three weeks.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   Two to three weeks.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.000]   I don't know.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.320]   And I should preface what I'm going to say by saying that I have owned a small amount
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.080]   of Amazon stock for a long time.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.320]   There are other bookstores.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.600]   And if Amazon is doing this, it is stupid and arrogant, and it's going to come back and
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   bite them because they do have enough market power in books that they should not be pulling
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.560]   stunts like that, assuming that that's what they're doing, which seems pretty likely.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.720]   Yes, it sure does.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.200]   It really, really dumb on their part.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.480]   You've got to think that this is the kind of thing that the FTC would get involved.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.120]   FTC's got FTC written all over it.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.120]   All over it.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:56.320]   Amazon is also- This is a little weird- patented the white seamless background.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.040]   Yeah, that's a classic.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.080]   Yeah, this is got everybody up and on.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.080]   That's ridiculous.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.600]   Amazon got up.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.440]   First of all, I don't know whether to blame Amazon.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.280]   I think I blame the US Patent and Trademark Office.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:18.000]   Amazon has patented the idea of taking a picture of a product against a seamless white
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   background.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Yeah, because that's never been done before.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.320]   Amazon's filing said, "In the past, you've had to use green screen or post-processing
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.680]   or image retouching or other special effects to achieve the result of an object set against
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.960]   a true white background."
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.080]   Thanks to our amazing invention.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.600]   You can now take pictures of an object against a white background that don't need retouching.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.040]   Never approved this at the patent office should be fired.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.320]   Whoever submitted it from Amazon, whoever the lawyer was, should be disbarred.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.080]   This is bullish.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.040]   It's stunning.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.520]   But you're right.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:08.760]   It mainly shows the complete and utter incompetence of the US Patent Office, which routinely
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.720]   gives out ridiculous patents.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.840]   That's why we have this ridiculous and terrible patent situation.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:19.120]   You want to read it, it's patent 8,676,045.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.160]   They got the patent on March 18th.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.240]   If you look at the diagram, it's...
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.840]   The diagram's like stick figures.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.440]   It's not even an interesting diagram.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.280]   They didn't even pay five bucks to some artist to do it right.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.000]   Yeah, it'd be a curved paper and some lights and you too can take perfect pictures against
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.160]   the white background.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.360]   You sure this wasn't published on April 1st?
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.360]   That's what I thought.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.120]   First thing I thought when I saw it.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.360]   Because look at it.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360]   Look at that picture.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.360]   That...
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.040]   I know it's ludicrous.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.080]   That children do better than that.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080]   That's really amazing.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.080]   That makes no sense.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.080]   Look at the man.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080]   Look at the person.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.080]   Yeah, it's literally a stick figure.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.080]   It's great.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080]   What is this?
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   A telephone?
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.440]   I think they're just trying to make mockery of the whole thing.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   That's it.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.680]   But you know what happens at companies like Amazon and Apple and Google, they have on
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   staff.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.240]   They're not even on a retainer on staff attorneys.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.040]   Often they're own building.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040]   Full of them.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.680]   And their only job is to go around and the story is told in Fred Vogelstein's excellent
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.200]   book Dogfight.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.520]   Apple attorneys going around saying what did you invent today?
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520]   No, I know.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.000]   And they're trying to get ideas going with that.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Oh, Lincoln patent net.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   That's patentable.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   What else?
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Oh, that's patentable.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   And you know what?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.560]   I don't blame the companies because this is such a broken system.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.400]   Well, they should patent everything.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   Why not?
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.680]   I wish I'd patent it podcasting when I invented it.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.200]   So it's you still can.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.200]   There's time.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.200]   I could reinvent it.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.240]   I'll approve any new invention.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.240]   Just submit it.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.000]   I don't look for prior art.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   Oh, no.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   They don't.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   Why should you?
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.040]   I have to think that some of this, it seems to be that the and maybe this is the law.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.360]   I don't know that the point is kind of give most patents approve most patents and let
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.400]   it let them fight it out in court because we don't have the manpower.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   No, that's what they're always saying.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.280]   We haven't got the manpower.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.960]   The second thing is more important.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.600]   They should look at this something like that.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.040]   The owner of the manpower just take a quick look and say this is out.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.320]   If you haven't got manpower, you don't approve this crap.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.840]   Well, the number one, you know, one of the main features you're supposed to look at is
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:33.840]   novelty.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   Is this something new?
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   Right.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.640]   Presumably this would fail right away.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.200]   Yes, I'll just figure out what we've been doing this.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.160]   So get this.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:50.800]   This is a graph from Tim Lee patent approval rates.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.240]   If the patent office says we approve 54% of all patents, but that's a little funny number
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.640]   because what they're saying is of the patents that come in the door, 54% get approved immediately.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.280]   But it turns out what mostly happens is patents that are turned down, the guy goes back, rewrites
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.920]   a few words, brings it in again.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.320]   Of all patent filings, 94% are approved.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.320]   That's nice.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.320]   94%.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.840]   Now here's a graph.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.400]   It's kind of hard to see.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.760]   I'll zoom in a little bit on this patent office allowance rates.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.640]   The patent office uses the lower line, but the top line is the line.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.440]   If we just look at all patents that come in the door, whether they ever get patented,
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:41.040]   we start in 1996, got almost 100% in 2001 and then went dipped a little bit under President
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.440]   Obama's patent commissioner, who happens to be a former Googler, by the way.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.040]   It's going, it's sky rocket and it's now currently 94%.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.920]   I'll start with that guy Clinton put in.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:58.080]   I actually was at a thing at the Commonwealth Club where it was the patent guy that was with
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.600]   Clinton and some, I think it was maybe less Sigur, somebody saying this is bogus.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.640]   I asked them an interesting question.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.600]   Because they had all these business practice patents now legal.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.880]   I said, is it possible to patent a football play?
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.560]   He said, well, he says the problem is there has to be some technology aspect to it or
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.760]   you can't patent it.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.400]   I said, what if it's a timing play?
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.520]   He says, yeah, you could patent that.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.320]   I'm sorry, he's not a Googler, he's an IBMer.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.720]   Oh, well the IBM, the number one patent machine.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.720]   They have a few.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:32.720]   They have a word.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]   Dave Capos.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]   They crank out everything.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:40.280]   He was a former Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and the Director
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.760]   of USPTO for, oh, till 2013.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.760]   So the new one.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.120]   I think IBM, didn't IBM invent patent trolling?
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.440]   I mean, they're pretty much, pretty much.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.440]   I think you're right.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.160]   Currently, the current Director of USPTO is Teresa Stanek Ria.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.560]   She's interim.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.760]   She's a pharmacist.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   Worked for drug companies.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.800]   What else does a lot of patents?
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.680]   Oh, yeah, big pharma.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   Big pharma.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.680]   Big pharma.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.440]   They're patenting genes.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320]   She resigned in November.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.960]   Who is it now?
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   No, it's.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   What?
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   Okay.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.640]   Any guesses on who this person will have worked for?
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.800]   Peggy Fokarino.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.680]   She doesn't even, she is not even a wiki producer.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.520]   Not even in Wikipedia.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:36.000]   She became, began performing the functions and duties of the commissioner for patents,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.200]   but we don't know who she is.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.680]   I'm guessing, I bet you she worked for somebody that doesn't.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.040]   That's probably the big pharma is the one really dominating.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.480]   Big pharma is the one, yeah.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.240]   That's where the, in fact, if I was big pharma trying to patent all this crazy stuff, I'd
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.960]   put some of these goofball patents through like the one about the white background, just
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.720]   a distract from the really nasty patents going through drugs.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   Well, that's actually for drugs.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.040]   Hey, we'll talk about Snapchat and wrap this up in a second.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.680]   But, Snapchat, Snapchat.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.480]   I know you love Snapchat for sending sexy pictures.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.480]   I've never used Snapchat, actually.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   Really?
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.400]   And I've always thought it was a honeypot.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.200]   Well, maybe it is.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.240]   The FTC thinks it is.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.240]   Somebody thinks it is.

[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.520]   So Snapchat, we knew this.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.680]   Snapchat, it turns out that's the company that teens love because they can take a picture
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   and actually now messages.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.440]   They can provide each other child pornography.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.200]   I don't think they do that.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.000]   I think that's what adults think they would do if they were teenagers.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.480]   Because that's what we would do.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.880]   In fact, there's a lot of sexting.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.880]   Let's put it.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   Is it really?
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.880]   Come on.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.880]   Is it places loaded with?
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.880]   That's where you would go to do this.
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   Yes, that's again.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:58.880]   I think that's what you think.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880]   You think?
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880]   Everybody, well fine.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.600]   But everybody out there who used the system to send a couple of, you know, racy pictures,
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.720]   you can be good.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.680]   Well, we all thought they disappeared.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:15.840]   You could set when you sent the picture, you could say I want it to be visible for 10
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.840]   to 30 seconds.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.320]   And then after that, it disappears.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.080]   Both my kids use it a lot.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:24.400]   And I think we talked to Dana Boyd on triangulation a couple of weeks ago.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:29.240]   She said she's the wonderful researcher who, the Harvard researcher, who really kind of
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.440]   keeps up on what kids today are doing and thinking.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   These kids.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.680]   No, she's good because she said, you know, what they really, it's for them, they understand
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.440]   privacy, the implications.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.080]   And they just want to, they want ephemera.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.760]   They want, they don't want, they don't like the fact that everything they do is preserved
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.120]   forever on ephemera.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:51.520]   They want, they want to be able to send an ephemeral picture once in a while.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.520]   I think that's reasonable.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.600]   Yeah, I've actually talked to my daughter and some of her friends about it, their teenagers.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.360]   And they, it's not so much that the pictures are dirty or it's that they don't have to
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   care about them.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   Right.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.320]   So if you take a picture, you put it on Instagram or Facebook, people are going to see it forever.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.920]   So then you have to agonize about whether it's any good or not.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.480]   You just want to take a stupid picture of yourself sticking your tongue out or making
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.480]   a stupid face.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.520]   You know, you don't have to worry about all these, everybody seeing it because only the
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.440]   person you sent it to is going to see it and they're only going to see it for 10 seconds.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.280]   I have to think, and my kids say exactly the same thing and everybody, and this isn't
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.280]   about second.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.640]   But I have to think there must be, there must be a, there must be a little bit of a subtle
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:37.600]   pressure on, on people who use Facebook and Instagram and Twitter that this is going
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   to live forever.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.000]   They just, this little, little niggling feeling of, well, it's, it's, yeah, it's the social
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   pressure.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.480]   In fact, I was at a party yesterday and there was a young kid who was, I think 14 and,
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.280]   and he was talking about Instagram and how, you know, this picture got this many likes
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.080]   and picture that many likes and it's so important.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:00.160]   And there's a huge amount of social pressure to just, well, why didn't my picture get
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.160]   any likes?
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.200]   But Snapchat, you don't have to worry about any of that.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.720]   It's literally just there and gone.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.760]   Well, clearly kid, the kids like somebody likes it because it's huge.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   Yes.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:09.760]   Facebook.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.760]   They're not so gone.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.880]   And pictures and corrupt apparently.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.560]   So, so well, let's talk about this.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:19.040]   But first Facebook tried to buy, no, Google tried to buy them or Facebook, somebody for
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.880]   three billion, Snapchat said, who were worth more than that?
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:25.200]   They probably would have been except for this.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.360]   Maybe they wish they'd taken the money.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.200]   I think, yeah, that would be what I would think.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200]   Facebook tried to compete with Polk.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.800]   Mark Zuckerberg said, I wrote this myself.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.960]   Actually this week, Facebook announced that they're killing both Polk and Facebook camera
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.880]   to apps that they developed that nobody adopted, but Snapchat lived on.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:48.200]   Well, a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Snapchat, the FTC said Snapchat was
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:54.960]   deceiving customers because, well, see this I don't, I think is BS because there are ways
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.080]   to save the message, for instance, opening it in a third party app or doing a screenshot.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.280]   I think everybody understands that app for sure.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.480]   And you can't fight that.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:09.120]   I mean, you could always put the Snapchat picture up there and take it with picture with a camera.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.040]   But also there's some issue about whether Snapchat may not actually be getting rid of
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.240]   that image on the server.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.480]   Well, they keep keeping something because apparently a bunch of phone numbers were like
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.480]   ripped off by some hackers.
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.400]   Yeah, to me it's not just the images.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.720]   They kept your location in some cases.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.320]   They kept contact information and other sort of personal information.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.240]   Like the images, I think we all knew they're on your phone.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.040]   Someone can get them if they want to.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:42.720]   Well, the FTC complaint did point out that for a year the FAQ at Snapchat's website read
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.240]   like this, "Is there any way to view an image after the time has expired?"
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.640]   Snapchat's answer, "No, snaps disappear after the timer runs out."
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.200]   I think it's reasonable for the FTC to say, "Well, a consumer might read that and think
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.840]   foolishly those pictures have disappeared."
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.480]   In 20 years...
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:06.440]   The third parties were getting access to the phone numbers of other people.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.640]   That was the real problem, I think.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.640]   That happened with WhatsApp as well, by the way.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:20.760]   There was a couple of malware apps on Android that were sending bogus paid texts, remember?
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.400]   And the way they got the phone number was they just checked with WhatsApp.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.560]   They said, "Hey, what's the phone number?"
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.600]   And WhatsApp said, "Oh, I'll tell you."
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.840]   So this is an issue all right.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.160]   FTC's complaint also said there were several security failures at Snapchat, a data breach
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.560]   in December in which 4.6 million Snapchat accounts and cell numbers were leaked onto
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.600]   the internet.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.720]   But did anybody assert that Snapchat could save those images on the Snapchat servers?
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.880]   Because I read that as well.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.480]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.480]   Why not?
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.280]   They have to go through this.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.920]   It's not clear that they did.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.880]   No, but why wouldn't they?
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.600]   But they did keep location information and contact info.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.040]   You know, I have a rule of thumb about information that goes online.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.720]   If it's something I'm really going to want to have later, I need to back it up myself.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:16.400]   If it's something that might embarrass me someday, I don't need to take any action.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.480]   It will live forever without any intervention.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:23.200]   That's the case.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.080]   That's for sure.
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:32.040]   Information Week lists five ways Snapchat violated your privacy security.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.600]   Recipients may have saved your image, right?
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.440]   Recipients may have saved your videos, right?
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.360]   Snapchat may have transmitted your location, or Snapchat may have collected contact information
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.600]   from your address book, and the Find Friends feature was not secure.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.080]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.000]   There was no financial penalty.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.200]   They just for 20, but this is a penalty though.
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.880]   For 20 years, like Snapchat's going to be around 20 years.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.800]   Does anybody think Snapchat is around 20 years?
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800]   Really?
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800]   Really?
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.960]   The FTC has mandated a monitor.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.080]   They're going to have to wear a bracelet.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.880]   Around their ankle?
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.720]   20 years.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.040]   It won't be 20.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.280]   Wait till you're right.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.800]   They'll be out of business, or the next Republican president will just drop it.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.640]   Well, didn't well, no, but now let's be honest.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640]   They're a public inheritor.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:25.840]   Same thing happened to Microsoft in that Department of Justice case, and that was one of the penalties
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.600]   Microsoft had to have a monitor.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.560]   And I think that person's not doing much.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560]   That's a good job.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560]   You've got to have an office in Redmond.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.560]   You're just sitting there.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   Yeah, that ended.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.560]   Go to Burger Master.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.560]   It didn't.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.280]   What did the monitor do?
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.280]   Nothing.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.280]   Okay.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.040]   What would you do?
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.040]   You sent a report.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.040]   Hey, Bill.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.640]   If I'm going to talk to you in a while, anything you want me to know?
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.640]   No.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.640]   Okay.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   Thanks.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.440]   Like parole officer, you drop by, you say hi.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.440]   You drop by.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.440]   Check and see if there's anybody buried in the backyard.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.440]   What are you?
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440]   What's in that backyard?
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.920]   There's a lump there with some fresh dirt.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:03.920]   Does that anything?
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.920]   It's a flower bed.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:05.920]   Okay.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:06.920]   Thanks.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:07.920]   See you.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:08.920]   Let's have lunch.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.920]   What do you say?
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.920]   Uh, Burger Master.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.920]   Okay.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.840]   Uh, Target CEO out of a job.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.440]   See, there's repercussions.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.800]   I'm surprised that these guys lasted that long.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.800]   I know.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.800]   That was a huge screw up.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.320]   I think it's hurt to come to this day.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.320]   I actually still, when I go to Target, I have a Target nearby and I pay cash.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.400]   I actually, last time I was there, I was pulling out my credit card and I said, "Nah, I'll
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.400]   pay cash."
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.920]   Because I don't know if I trust you still.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.720]   That may be the first time there's been actual consequences for a company doing a big data
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.720]   breach.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.720]   I mean, and it's the first one I remember.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.720]   Typically, there's no consequence at all.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.280]   I think that's great that they fired them and that's great that they're losing business.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.440]   That's what needs to happen.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.680]   Is that, are they losing business?
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.680]   Wow.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.680]   I think they lost a lot of business.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.680]   Wow.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.920]   They're coming back and I go still go there by pay cash.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:04.520]   So just a little tip to, you know, CEOs of major companies, whenever there's a security
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.320]   breach, you do not tell anyone.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.600]   That's the old rule.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.600]   That's old school.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.600]   Well, look what happened.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.720]   He told people, "Boom, he's out of work."
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   Old school.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   That's what the bank's always do.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.720]   Keep it a secret.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.720]   Yep.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.720]   No one needs to know.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720]   Nothing happened.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.720]   Pay no attention.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.560]   Don't know what you're talking about.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.680]   Hey, congratulations to Brewster Cale and the Internet Archive.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:31.240]   You know, the Wayback Machine, which has been indexing the Internet since 2001.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240]   Can you imagine?
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.000]   I thought it goes before that.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.200]   That's when the Wayback Machine launched.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:44.360]   In 2006, Archive it launched, allowing libraries to create curated collections of web content.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.880]   In other words, enlisting libraries to help them.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:53.240]   They built a new data center in 2009, a three petabyte data center.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.680]   In 2011, the HTTP Archive became part of the Internet Archive.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.280]   What's, I don't know what that is.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.280]   In 2020, I'm just reading crap here.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   I don't know what that is.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.280]   I didn't know about that.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.520]   That means, how about this?
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.160]   This is the landmark.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:16.840]   Four hundred billion indexed web pages.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.400]   Four hundred billion, that encompasses the web as it looked anytime from the late 1996
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.080]   up to a few hours ago.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.840]   That is a major milestone.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840]   Four hundred billion web pages.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.120]   You know what I didn't know?
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:33.760]   I went looking for the first Twitter's first homepage because I wanted a screenshot to
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   use them.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:41.800]   I'm a blog post and I searched for it and the Wayback Machine said Twitter has blocked
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.440]   us from, or that website is not available.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]   That's really.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.200]   They send all the content to the Library of Congress with a huge pipe and they also sell
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.720]   the pipe to anybody who has enough money.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.360]   You can get the pipe and get all the Twitter stuff, but they won't let the Archive.org
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.280]   just put a simple screenshot up.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.880]   Yeah, I thought that was weird.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.880]   Doosh bags.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   Ooh.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.800]   Howie, howie.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:14.120]   Well here is from, this is, I don't see a lot of CSS, but this is Twitter from 2006 when
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.560]   it was TWTTR.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.680]   Use TWTTR to stay in touch with your friends all the time.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.760]   If you have a cell phone and text messages, you'll never be bored again ever.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]   I use it.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   I still get bored.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:31.080]   Here's a public timeline of actual real life people doing stuff.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.000]   Watch tweets, Mars, the red planet is about to be spectacular.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.960]   Then he tweets and the installation is free.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.680]   Then he apparently, Rich, the only guy using Twitter, Rich tweets, watching a special on
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.840]   Andre the Giant.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:54.000]   Then Ray, ready, Ray tweets had a good conversation with my mom.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]   This is Twitter as it was.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.920]   Yeah, that's the way I said she's not much different.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.560]   Here's where you put in your mobile number and everything.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.920]   There is some early stuff.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:12.000]   It also says the top, try out other stuff ODO makes because this Twitter thing, we don't
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.280]   know if it's going to survive.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.480]   The Wayback Machine is at Internet Archive, I'm sorry, archive.org is the Internet Archive.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:27.320]   You can enter in URLs and the earliest is August 2nd, 2006 for Twitter.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.720]   That's kind of cool.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.680]   There is some old stuff, Matthew, but there's no screenshots.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:39.280]   Yeah, I was looking for the image that was used like the logo and stuff like that that
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.720]   was used on the page.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.960]   Here's a good one.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.800]   This is the first fail whale from September 2006.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.880]   Got an HTTP 302 response at crawl time.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.600]   Oh no, that's because it changed to Twitter.com.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   That was when it changed from the TWITT.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.160]   That was your opportunity.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.160]   Right there.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.400]   To jump on the Twitter bandwagon.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.600]   No, no, to sue them.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.440]   Could have done that would have been fun.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.880]   Here's another early tweet.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.320]   This is what has come to ladies and gentlemen listening.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.800]   Old tweets.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.960]   Not even new tweets.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:16.480]   Really old tweets.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.480]   Old tweets.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.960]   This is the old tweet show.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   That's an idea.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.120]   That's another possibility for your network.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.360]   Old tweets show with couple of old farts.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.600]   And then, yeah, man, those six and then is tweeted already.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.840]   I'm heading home now.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.240]   Fascinating.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:41.360]   My tweeted this really is the first day of the rest of my life.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.760]   Ah, that's just you can't get better than that.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.160]   Make up stuff this good.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.760]   I'm going to take a nap.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:54.640]   I do think that someday the future of TWITT is me and John sitting on a porch playing
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.640]   checkers.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.640]   Could be.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.880]   Chinese checkers to be exact.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.280]   Let's take a break.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.440]   When we come back, a final word, we'll say good night to all our friends and family.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   And a happy Mother's Day.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.200]   Anybody wants to say happy Mother's Day, their mom will give you a chance to do that
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200]   in a second.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.800]   First, let's ask Mike Elgin.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.960]   What's coming up in the week ahead, Mike?
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.720]   In the week ahead, Motorola is making a big announcement in London on Tuesday, May 13th.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.520]   We're expecting the company to launch an updated version of the Moto-Acephone plus a
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.880]   new low-cost phone called the Moto-E.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.880]   And the Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote on Thursday, May 15th,
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.560]   on proposed rules that would end net neutrality in the United States.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.800]   That's what's coming up in the week ahead.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.880]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:45.840]   Mike Elgin, TNT, every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern times, 1,700
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.040]   UTC, your daily dose of tech news.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:53.880]   And of course, we now have an evening show, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time, 2,300
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.280]   UTC, T&2 tech news tonight with Sarah Lane.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.480]   So we got your tech news covered.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.840]   Our show today brought to you by gazelle.com, the fastest, simple way to sell those old gadgets.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.040]   John, I gave you my old HTC One.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.800]   I know you would like the new HTC One M8.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.640]   Can I sell the old one?
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   Sell the old one.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.640]   You know what?
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640]   We should check.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.640]   Let's see what it's worth.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.560]   Gazelle, we've got some gadgets, new gadget announcements coming up.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.560]   You've served Motorola.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.520]   Maybe you want to check out whether your Moto X is worth now.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:27.400]   The nice thing about gazelle.com is that, quote, you get today is good for 30 days.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:35.880]   So if, for instance, Motorola comes out with a new Moto X, and of course, when it does,
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.320]   you know the price is going to go down on the old one.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.320]   You've got that quote.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.400]   You've got it locked in for $115.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.960]   For the old Moto X?
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.160]   Oh, that's a good deal.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160]   That's a good deal.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160]   HTC.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160]   All right, let's go here.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.160]   We have HTC One.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:52.920]   You know, the iPads, iPhones, yours is unlocked, which makes it extra.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920]   No, it's not.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.960]   Oh, that was the one that I gave you that was locked.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:56.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:57.960]   Never mind.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.640]   It's good for playing Angry Birds.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:01.640]   Is that what you're doing with that?
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.680]   No, I use it for miscellaneous things.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:07.160]   You can still Wi-Fi with it.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.040]   Skype with it.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.360]   There it is.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.360]   Here it is.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.280]   The 132 gig.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280]   Good.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.240]   Condition, $145.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.560]   It's like I gave you cash.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560]   It is.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.560]   Like I gave you actual money.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.560]   I'm going to block this deal in.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.800]   I've been a few of you have three comes here.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.800]   Anyway, gazelle.com, they will buy your old gadgets.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800]   They will give you cash.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.800]   Actually, it's kind of nice.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.400]   So get the 30-day quote, and you don't have to pull the trigger until that new thing comes
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.760]   out, or you have time to decide, time to buy, time to move the data over.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.520]   Then check out, they'll send you a box.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:43.880]   They'll pay for the postage on anything worth more than a buck, and yes, they buy a broken
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.200]   iPhone, broken iPads, and yes, those are worth more than a buck.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.480]   They ship it to them.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.680]   If you don't remove the data, they'll do that for you, and then they'll send you a
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:58.200]   check, a PayPal credit, or an Amazon gift card that's worth 5% more because they just
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.320]   like you so much.

[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.440]   Yeah, I know you do.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.440]   I think that's the fun we got.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.440]   You liked the other one too.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.600]   I did, but I think this is even better.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.600]   But I'm curious to see what the role is going to be.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   You keep going from the phone to phone to phone to phone.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   It's my job.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.600]   I'm a little frog.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   I'll be happy to move.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.600]   Have you not liked a phone?
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.600]   Many.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:39.600]   I don't like the Samsungs anymore.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.080]   I think Samsungs are crapped up.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.080]   It's funny.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.080]   A lot of people feel that way.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.080]   Well, I'm not alone.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.080]   All right.
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.640]   Well, that killed the show.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640]   I think we're done.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640]   King me.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   I think we're done.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640]   King me, John.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.440]   Here you go.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.760]   Somebody wanted me to, they've been, Chad has been getting, wanting me to show this picture
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.640]   from Audotopia.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.720]   Solar panels that, I mean, I'm telling you, this thing does this.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.480]   But you can use as parking tile, as tiles in your driveway or parking lot.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480]   I like that.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.480]   And then a good idea.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   There's so tough you can drive on them.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.000]   It's actually an indie go-go.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.920]   Did you see, and actually, if you didn't see, we're going to launch it right after this
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.840]   show, I think, right?
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.840]   We did it in beta.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.840]   I want you to be honest, John.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:26.840]   Okay.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.840]   In fact, you all- I'm on.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.160]   I mean, you, you two, Dan and Matthew, it's called I'd fund that.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.640]   And the idea is people have kick starters or indie go-gos.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.040]   We, we, we'll line up through four of them.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.040]   They'll come in, they'll pitch us, we'll sit here, the judges, and we'll ask them questions
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.520]   and we'll decide whether we'd fund it or not.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   You can hold the numbers.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.520]   Well, this, yes or no, thumbs up, thumbs up.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.360]   So this is a shark tank.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.000]   It's like shark tank, but for, uh, con-source.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.280]   So you've cloned shark tank.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   For crowdsourcing.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.280]   Well, that's our mark, Cuban.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.480]   Yeah, shark tank was a clone of, uh, dragons, Dan.
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.480]   It was, right.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.480]   Which was a clone of something else.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.640]   Probably was.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.680]   So, uh, but the fun thing is it's for crowdsourced stuff.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.680]   We get to see a lot of new projects.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:04.680]   We did the first one yesterday.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.680]   It was so much fun.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.280]   We're going to replay that after this show.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280]   So stay tuned.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.480]   But it, I think it's a fun idea.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.720]   And you'd be a great judge because you're so skeptical.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.080]   No, no, I'm a good guy.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.760]   I think you would just hate everything.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.080]   I would like everything.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.280]   I don't think so.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.600]   Unless it involved drawing in a YouTube.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.200]   Oh, sure.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.200]   Drawing.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.400]   Matthew Ingram, giga-ohm.com.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.960]   He's back from Perugia.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.240]   He's probably wants to go back to a Trusca, a Truscanne.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:32.240]   Sure do.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.240]   It's not a Truscanne.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.240]   It's a Truscanne.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.240]   A Truscane.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.240]   What is it?
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.120]   They're going to Tuscany.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.920]   It's the old capital of the Truscans.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.920]   Umbria.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.920]   Umbria.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.920]   Uh-huh.
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:50.000]   Uh, anything you want to plug anything at all?
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.360]   Uh, god, nothing.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.520]   Are you wearing Vibrum five fingers shoes right now?
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.520]   I am not.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:58.960]   Doesn't he look like somebody who might be?
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.600]   No, not to me.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.100]   He looks Canadian.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:04.100]   I thought about it, but I-
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.100]   Oh, he's thought about it.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.100]   Well, that's not good.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.600]   Actually, they lost court and they're going to pay people back.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.600]   Why?
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.600]   For sure.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600]   Because they make claims that weren't true.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.720]   They're not that good for you, actually, to run in.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.120]   But then James Fallows wrote a spirited defense of the-
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.120]   You know what?
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.120]   So, Fallows wears them and what do you say?
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.480]   James Fallows wears them.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.640]   So, he said they were great for me.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.360]   I'm not going to ask for my money back.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.740]   But, yeah, they claimed health benefits that really don't.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:40.740]   But the funny thing is, I don't think anybody cares one way or another about that.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:43.300]   It's like the reaction to Crocs.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:46.420]   They're so horrendously awful looking.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.220]   That people just hate them.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:53.060]   And they just are so happy that they lost that case.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:54.580]   It's so weird.
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:55.820]   'Cause it was so what?
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.140]   If you want to wear shows, do's shoes with toes.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.140]   Who cares?
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.940]   I can't believe anyone would wear those.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:01.940]   I know.
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.940]   Well, let's look at our audience.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.940]   'Cause we frequently have people wearing them.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.940]   Anybody?
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:07.940]   No.
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:08.940]   All right.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:09.940]   We've got a good crowd today.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:11.940]   So, if somebody wearing those plus Google Glass, you're really-
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.940]   Oh!
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:13.940]   There you go.
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:14.940]   There's your stereotype.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:16.460]   Silicon Valley written all over.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.340]   And then they hop on their segue at the end of the show and they go home.
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:20.940]   Yeah, and run into a wall.
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:23.900]   No, no, they get on a Google bus.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:24.900]   Yes.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.060]   Have you guys been watching Silicon Valley?
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.060]   It's good, isn't it?
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:32.620]   You know, the promise to look on Valley, I've said it before, is that it's hard to ridicule
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:33.820]   a clown.
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:38.100]   And Silicon Valley itself is so idiotic with some of the stuff you can get off the YouTube
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.540]   of people giving you lectures and speeches like that character from AOL.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:44.500]   It's got the long hair and the British accent.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.500]   Xingy.
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:46.500]   Yeah, that- Yeah, Xingy.
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:48.500]   You can't make that guy up.
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.380]   You can't make that guy up.
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.380]   You can't make that guy up.
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.380]   Is Leo LePercio?
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:54.380]   Hurts the show.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:55.380]   What?
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:56.380]   Hello?
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.940]   You woke me up there, Chet.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:04.020]   You know, the guy who plays Peter Gregory, who is a thinly veiled parody of Peter Thiel.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.020]   Yes, I know.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:06.500]   That's a good character.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.500]   Christopher Evan Welch, he passed away and I don't think he'll be in this week's episode.
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:11.340]   I think he- Oh, I didn't know he passed away.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.500]   His last episode was, I think, last week he did five episodes.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.540]   Yeah, 47 years old died of lung cancer.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:18.540]   Was that sad?
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.540]   Was he a smoker?
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.980]   He actually- No, I don't know, but he knew that he was not- He knew he was dying.
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:26.500]   I'll be blunt.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:30.460]   When he took the job, when he auditioned for it, I wonder what they're going to do with
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.460]   it this week.
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:36.300]   But it's a sad thing because he is the highlight of the show.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.780]   He's kind of borderline autistic.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:38.780]   Yeah, he's great.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:39.780]   Venture capitalists.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:44.060]   It's just, it's like you can't take your eyes off him.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.980]   They just have to kill him in the show and bring somebody else's worst.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:49.980]   You had that really thin car?
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:52.260]   Yeah, I love that thin car.
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:53.260]   Oh, billion.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.820]   And he couldn't look anybody in the eye.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:56.820]   No.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.060]   He couldn't look anybody in the eye.
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:02.220]   John C. Dvorak channel, Dvorak.com, but most importantly, NoahGenesShow.com.
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:04.020]   How is Adam doing these days?
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.020]   He's going to Japan.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.580]   And we're doing the show, now we're going to do a show from Tokyo.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.580]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:10.580]   It's going to be kind of interesting.
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:11.580]   Is he moving to Japan?
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:14.500]   No, he seems to be in some sort of fugitive thing going on.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:15.660]   I think after him.
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:17.660]   He changes countries a little too frequently.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.220]   Well, he's just going there for a week.
[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:20.220]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.220]   He's not moving.
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:22.780]   But yeah, NoahGenesShow.com, we've got some good stuff.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.140]   People should check it out if they haven't already.
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.140]   What's the best thing?
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:26.140]   What's the best thing that you can do?
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:29.820]   No, NoahGenesShow.com is probably the best place to start.
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:34.260]   Or if you're in Silicon Valley, look at a new, you know, any new stand or place where
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.860]   they hand out free newspapers.
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:36.860]   Maybe it did.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:40.220]   John goes around leaving CDs of the show.
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.220]   It's marketing.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:43.220]   Cheap marketing.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.220]   It's brilliant.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:48.140]   Hey, it's so great to see you again, Dan.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:50.500]   Thank you for the work you do at the Guardian.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.740]   I think you're really the voice of reason there.
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.100]   And it must be fun working at the Cronkite School.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:56.100]   That's great.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:01.660]   It's fun and great students.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:02.660]   The future is there.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:04.940]   They're going to do stuff that we never thought of.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.580]   Well, you focus on digital.
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:08.340]   I do.
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:11.100]   Which is probably wise in this state.
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.580]   You don't want to be the guy who's saying, you know, newsprint.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:14.580]   That's the future.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:17.580]   There are guys that still teach that old stuff.
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:22.820]   Dude, do you teach a different kind of journalism because it's digital?
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.820]   Journalism is journalism.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:31.140]   I'm working on things like media literacy and entrepreneurship, things like that.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:34.460]   Yeah, I tell you what, if I were a young person, I would start my own business.
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:37.340]   This is a great time to be an entrepreneur, to be.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:42.500]   And if the government doesn't screw it up, maybe it will continue to be so.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:43.500]   Thank you, Dan.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:44.500]   It's great to see you again.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:45.500]   Thank you for being here.
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.500]   Thanks for having me.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.500]   Thanks to everybody for joining us.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:52.540]   We do TWIT every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time 2200 UTC.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:53.660]   It's great if you watch live.
[01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:54.660]   We love our chat room.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:57.500]   We love the interaction we get from the chat room.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.660]   It's fantastic.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.180]   If you want to be live in studio, we always have a nice bunch of people in here.
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.540]   They most of the time are wearing regular shoes.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:09.740]   Occasionally we're glass, but you could do that by emailing tickets at TWIT.tv.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.740]   We welcome you here.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:16.140]   It's always great to see we got one, two, three from Australia from all over the world.
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:17.140]   Ohio.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.940]   I don't know if that's Ohio.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:19.940]   I can't remember.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.940]   Minnesota, right?
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:21.940]   Minneapolis.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:22.940]   As we would call it, Minnesota.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.940]   They're Minnesota nuts?
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:25.860]   No, it's just a...
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:26.860]   Who's we?
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:29.260]   It's an E-I-T-M thing, never mind.
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:31.620]   Anyway, tickets at TWIT.tv.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:35.660]   Of course, you can always get the show after the fact on demand audio and video available
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:44.020]   at TWIT.tv, but also everywhere you can get shows like this of this sort, Stitcher, iTunes,
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.460]   the other day I saw it on Tivo.
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.220]   You can Tivo it as well.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:48.220]   Roku box you're on.
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:49.620]   Roku, we got our own ROK.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:51.380]   Actually the apps are a great way to watch.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:55.420]   We have a great group of developers on Android iOS.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:56.900]   I was watching on the Windows phone.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:58.900]   The Roku box of the day and it's nice and clear.
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900]   Isn't it great?
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:01.900]   That's why I complained about this, these mics.
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.740]   Because you suddenly saw us as a television show.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:05.780]   Yeah, and you need to level theirs as opposed to...
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:06.780]   You know, I like the look.
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:07.780]   It's a little retro.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.260]   I just like the idea of a big fat bar.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.660]   Well, at least you're not wearing the cans.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:13.220]   Big mic.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.220]   In the morning, John.
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.220]   In the morning.
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.220]   In the morning.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.220]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:18.220]   We'll see you next week.
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:19.220]   Another TWIT is in the can.
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.220]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:23.700]   They tell me if I do this, people will applaud.
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.700]   You ready?
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:26.700]   Do you want the TWIT, baby?
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700]   Do you want the TWIT?
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.700]   Alright.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:30.700]   Do you want the TWIT, baby?
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.700]   Do you want the TWIT?
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:32.700]   Alright.
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.700]   Do you want the TWIT, baby?
