[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And we have, this is going to be a lot of fun. It's going to be like a version of kind of computer crossfire.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   On the left. Ed Bot.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Joining us from ZDNet. Great to see Ed.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Always happy to be on the left, Leo.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Good friend. And always welcome to the show. On the right.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com. He hosts many shows on iMore and also goes back very quickly.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Great to see you. Renee, you're back.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Absolutely. I'm back in nicely air conditioned Montreal and away from your heatwave.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And then from all the way from Taiwan, Ben Thompson of Stratecary. Great to have you, Ben.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Great to be here. Early morning. Good to get up early.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm this weird middle thing. I was in terms of this last week.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   But while there, I tried to stay on Taiwan time and I'm halfway succeeded.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So I've been kind of in the halfway time.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Oh, you must be here. You just messed up.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You just shot. Ben and I were at a Japanese whiskey bar until a very late night.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, what fun. So I don't know how he's doing this today. Oh, what fun. That's awesome.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Well, I think anybody who's tuned in today knows that probably most of the conversation will be about Apple's event.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Although John McAfee is running for president and I think that there is something to be said there.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But we'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You were at the Apple event, Ben. I take it. That's why you're in the Bay Area.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I mean, it turned out I actually had something else going on.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's hard to justify flying over just for the Apple event, but I turned out I had two events in one week.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So it worked out perfectly. So yes, I was there.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's true. You can watch now the stream. Thank you, Apple, for streaming.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Right. No, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And I know Renee, you were there. And of course, the real advantage of going is the hands-on.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Because that's the only way you can touch this stuff.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Exactly. Yep.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So before the event, we talked a little bit about this on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   There was some discord in the Apple press community.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   There were those like John Pachkowski of Buzzfeed and Mark Gurman of 9 to 5 Mac who said,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "No, they're going to announce an iPad." And then those like John Grubber said,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   "They can't possibly announce an iPad." The event would be too long.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Well, they were both right. The event was too long and they announced the iPad.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Almost two and a half hours if you include one direction.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Siggin? Zing. Zing. They were both right.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I was shocked because normally Apple begins these events with a discussion of sales,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   how well the stores are doing, how many people use iPhones.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And we knew it had to be an iPhone event. They've got to announce a new iPhone that they buried that right at the back.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They opened with WatchOS 2.0 and weirdly these Hermes...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't know. It looks like a B&D band. It was a double wrap kind of like leather.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I think it's called the double tour.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Double tour. I do believe it's a double tour.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Don't they want?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yes, to use it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   To say it correctly.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That wasn't one direction. It was one republic. I'm so sorry.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We keep making that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah, everyone's making that.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Is there a one's a boy band and one's a boy band?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Okay, that's the problem I'm having.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But Harry is in one direction, not one republic.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Right, if it had been one direction, that would have been more humorous because one of the rumors is that Taylor Swift was going to perform.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so had Harry Styles showed up.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah, I'm showing way too much familiarity with this.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I can't believe you know this. In fact, I can't believe I know this.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Because why is her techery is so on point?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   You've got to stay in touch with what's going on.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So they talked about the watch, then they went right to the iPad Pro, long rumor.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   In fact, there was nothing really in these announcements that we didn't already know from the rumors.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yeah, so I'm challenged. So the thing with this is that like what to me is always not the interesting thing.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's how and why that's the interesting thing.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Like iPad Pro has been in the works for years.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   New Apple TV's been in the works for years.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And you all the stuff here, they've been working on it for years.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But what they choose to ship and what the reason, the rationale they give behind it is what makes the events interesting to me.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Good.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I think that's the challenge. I think that was something that why Gruber was suspicious of the time.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I actually tweeted because Tim Cook said the biggest news in iPad.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I said the biggest news in iPad is that Gruber is wrong.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   But I think what I actually thought the event was as a production was quite good when the better one's Apple's done in quite a while.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And despite the fact there was so much in there, it was relatively long. It was quite tight.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But what was missing was one of my favorite post jobs.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I've entered keynotes is the iPhone 5S keynote and 5C.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And this is when there's all Apple's have a well cast phone and they have to go across one of those kind of the big thing going on.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And Apple came out starting talking about the iTunes Music Festival.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Now this highly produced video that was really compelling.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And basically if you step back and look at the presentation as a whole,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   the presentation as a whole was making the case that Apple's saying no, we're not going to compete on price.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We're going to compete on delivering an entire experience that covers all these sorts of things.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And in that context, it made the phone delivery much more compelling.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And that's what gets lost when you have these events with all these things in it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   There was no real context around a lot of this stuff.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So what you're saying is subtext is important in these events.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Some sort of text.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   What is the subtext of Wednesday's announcement?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Well, I mean, if anything, it was, you know, we're firing at all cylinders from a new product perspective.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I mean, the sheer amount of stuff that was introduced was, you know, pretty overwhelming in some respects.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   But the sort of big picture where does this fit in what we're doing and what we care about that was by necessity absent.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   You know, it's funny because there really a couple of different audiences for any Apple event.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There's us.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The over-involved Apple press.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   There is the person who buys Apple stuff and wants to know what the next thing is so they can decide whether to buy it.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And then there's the rest of the world.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I was in New York City.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I felt terrible.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Like this first Apple event I've missed in a long time.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And I'm looking around and I'm in a cab.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Nobody's listening to the Apple event on the radio.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Nobody's even taken any notice of it at all.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   They're just, they're living their life.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   They don't understand.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's the most important day of the year and they don't seem to know.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Well, that's why the context is important though because, yes, the biggest audience is, well, first off journalists and now that it's streaming, that's expanded.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And maybe that's changed or thinking about it.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But this is their real chance to kind of shape the messaging around their products and what they do.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And that's something they didn't take advantage of.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Without their being, that sort of context and how you should think about this sort of stuff.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's exactly what I mean by what is gone now.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And maybe part of it is because it's streamed now and I think we'll have 40 million or something like that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I mean, yeah, maybe it was in your cab driver, but it's kind of like the whole, we don't need to do macro because we have stores sort of argument, whether you buy it or not.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Yeah, and there's another issue here too and that's sort of what I think through John and not to defend him because he doesn't need it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   But most years they have two events.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   They have the iPhone plus something event and then the iPad and Mac event.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And once it was decided they weren't going to have the October event that this was going to be the only event in the fall, then everything that's ready has to fire and anything that's not stage where they just gets dropped in a press release.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So the context of this is not one overarching thing like music and here's all the stuff you can do with music, but it's these are the products we're announcing this year and how are we going to sort of put those into chapters.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   In this event.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Ed bot, of course, mostly you cover Windows and ZD net blog and I'm thinking I'm looking at this and I almost can wear two hats.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   If I'm the, if I'm the, yeah, for this, if I'm the cynic, I look at this and I say in every respect, this is Apple playing catch up.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   They're making a surface pro analog. They're finally, you know, they're making an Apple TV, which is basically a Nintendo Wii combined with maybe a fire TV.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   They're making phones that, you know, finally have 12 megapixel camera.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   They're kind of the last one still making an eight megapixel camera.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   If there's, there's one context, you can look at this and where you just say, well, this is Apple playing catch up.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   There's nothing innovative here. Of course, there's a second context, which we Apple enthusiasts embrace where we're trying to really understand something that there's more important.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   What's your take on on it, Ed? What did you think overall?
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Well, this looks to me like the, the, the coming out of a company that is in full maturity.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Everything that they showed at the event was incremental and yet a positive improvement.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   They're, they don't have to convince their market to go and buy stuff. They don't have to come out with magical and revolutionary things to try to expand the market right now.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   They already have a very loyal following. They already have product cycles that they've settled into very nicely.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And so these are all the, the, the logical progressions of every single product that they have in their, in their, in their product line.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   So it's, and even the, the Hermes stuff is an extension of their desire to become identified as a luxury brand.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And so that was, you know, they, they started that with the watch edition. And now they're starting to put other, other brands on top of it.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   This to me is, is not just a company that is, you know, sort of secure in its products, but that is, and not just firing on all cylinders, but that has this steady, almost monotonous pipeline of products that it doesn't really have to sell very hard anymore
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   because its audience understands what they're going to do.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   If you look at the rhetoric, they're trying to convince people that, well, look at the tagline for the iPhone 6S. The only thing that's changed is everything.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's sort of a joke though. It's not really true. All the S phones are always said to be like, you know, they're boring. They're just an incremental upgrade.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   So Apple's sort of playing on that to make fun of themselves before anybody else.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Oh, so they're making fun of themselves?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Well, yeah, so it's like the idea was the iPhone 4S came out. Oh, it's boring. It's the same. And the iPhone 5 asking. Oh, it's boring. It's the same. So Apple's saying upfront. The only thing we know, it's the same, but everything else has changed.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   So I think it's an attempt to own that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   The only thing that's changed is everything is actually a lie.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It is not, it looks exactly the same.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Sure, but I mean, it's got different aluminum, different glass, different.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Oh, yeah. When I were using aluminum, 7,000 instead of 6,000.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Well, it makes sense in context, Leo. Okay.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Well, I mean, okay, then as long as we're talking, no, no, I'm going to give you a chance to make them to be fair because I'm being unfair. I know.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Then on the Apple TV, the future of television, I think it could make a strong case. This is actually the past of television, finally catching up to the president of television.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   So it's entirely perspective based. If you look at Apple, they weren't the first to the phone. They weren't the first to the iPad. They played catch up in both those areas.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That's sort of their game. Very rarely are they first to market. Usually they wait. They try to see what's in the market, what pain people are expressing.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Then they very carefully pick their shots and they waited a long time for the Apple TV because they were already in that market.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   But doing things like the iPad Pro with the keyboard for a lot of people, this is fairly or unfairly.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   There's an old joke like Nokia invented everything in 1812, but nobody saw it.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And it's a similar thing. All these products have been introduced, but Apple's trying to make the mainstream.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And by the way, I'm putting on a very contrarian hat here.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's your job, Leo.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Well, because I am actually very... I think there's one product that Apple announced that I think is actually a world changer.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   But I want to let you guys tease that out first. So Ben, you were going to say something?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I was just going to make the point that if your reason to say that the success is the same is because it looks the same,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   is to kind of fall into the stereotype of design is just how it works.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   But to say that everything has changed is clearly not true.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I mean, since when is Apple's marketing getting too?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Okay.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Right. And just to be clear, I think Apple is having a hard time in recent years coming up with good marketing tagloals.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   They use all this approach.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   All the good stuff.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Last year. Well, last year wasn't it bigger than bigger?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Yeah. That's not so good either. Bigger than big.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Which was... I mean, I think... So there's two things that are going on here.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Number one is, I can imagine the marketing meeting where somebody just throws up their hands and says, "Oh, screw it."
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You know, we got to come up with... Is this the best we got? Fine. It's the best one on the whiteboard.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Let's use it. And the other thing is, they're doing a sort of time-tested technique, which is to...
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   It's almost jujitsu marketing. Take your weakness.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Right.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And make it a strength. So last year, their weakness was that they were finally, years after the rest of the market, had started delivering phones that were the size that people wanted.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They finally delivered a phone that was the two phones that were big enough for people.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So they come up with a slogan bigger than bigger, saying, "It's not just bigger."
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Well, yes, it was. The major point was that it was bigger. And this year, the only thing that's changed is everything.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Well, actually, no. Everything has changed a little bit. But everything's a little bit better.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And if you're in the market for a phone right now, this is your good choice from Apple.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And you're on fire. It's two for two great takes.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I really agree.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And it's kind of what Renee was saying. There's a certain sense of irony when you say the only thing that's changed is everything.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   There's an eye rot. It's jujitsu.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I think that's a great way to describe it.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Well, I took it actually, maybe just because I think in the financial world and business world.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But I took it as a direct kind of statement to Wall Street.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I mean, the big kind of concern around Apple and their stock right now is the comp problem,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   which is the year over year comparisons to last year, which was insane and clearly an apple that's been facing.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   It's a possible sustain that kind of growth.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Eventually you run out of humans.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Well, I mean, no, Apple doesn't have, I mean, that's the advantage of being in the sense of device.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Apple doesn't have the human problem. It has the...
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Christ problem.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   It's the affluent human problem.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Right, which is in some respects, there's something to be said for that.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   But when you say that nothing has changed except everything, I think that's speaking to the...
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   There's going to be a reason to buy. There's going to be a reason to upgrade.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And what's interesting is actually I thought the event was very compelling from reason to upgrade.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Not just, but only partially because of the feature perspective, but also some of the financing stuff they talked about.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I think actually the changes in carrier plans in the US is going to work hugely to Apple's benefit.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I think the kind of... The conventional was in that Apple wins because of subsidies is pretty sorely mistaken.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Even on stage, Apple's still quoting prices that are subsidized prices.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I think they were loath to say, "Started 650 bucks."
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I bought the 6S Plus loaded. It was over $1,000.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Yeah, I mean, when they first showed the slide, it only showed the kind of going.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Everyone in the journal section was kind of like...
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Snicker, snicker.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Shaking their... Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But they followed it right up with the...
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Then they listed all the carriers like per month prices.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Okay.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And then they did their own upgrade plan, which is very interesting.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So actually, I thought they were relatively transparent about it.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Even though, yes, of course, they didn't show the...
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   They don't want to tell you how much it is because it's a really outrageously expensive.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Although, on the other hand, I went to Apple's site before the show today because I wanted to...
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   There's sold out.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Yeah, well, I wanted to check out some of the details of their financing because that wasn't exactly clear on how that was going to work.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And I was pleased to see that they're not quoting contract prices.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   They are quoting full retail prices.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then the monthly contract prices on the 24-month installment with...
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   There was an asterisk on those, but it's still...
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   You know, 199, 299, 399 is not honest.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And I didn't see that when I went to the website.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So that was...
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   That'd be fair.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That'd be fair.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   A little bit.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   A big problem that I have with this whole, like, Apple's going to lose once it's a longer subsidized thing,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   is there's kind of this implicit, like, consumers are stupid argument here.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And I do think consumers are lazy.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   But they're not.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I do.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Right.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   No, exactly.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I mean, I don't think anyone is...
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   You know, we'll see how it plays out in these new contracts thing.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   But I don't think that it's necessarily going to hurt Apple.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And if anything, the additional flexibility and freedom to upgrade sooner and more quickly is going to help them.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I mean, all...there's lots of forces in the market that are in the iPhone's favor right now.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   First and foremost of which is people are now buying their second or third smartphone.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And the big thing is when you were buying your first smartphone, you didn't understand how important the smartphone was to you.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Right.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Now you're willing to pay more, I agree.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Exactly.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Because you realize that this is now the most important device in your life.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And if there's one thing you're going to pay a premium for, make sense of that thing.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And yes, you say Leo 1000 is a lot.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Well, one, you're buying the total top of the line.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But two, in the grand scheme of things, a thousand dollars is a lot less than, say, buying a BMW, right?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Or buying a...
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah, but that's not what you should compare it to, because you're compared to for instance, a Windows PC for $400.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   No, but the point is that absolute numbers matter just as much as relative numbers.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Yes, relatively speaking, a phone is much more important.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Is much more...an iPhone is more expensive than a perfectly valid alternative.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   The best top computer.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   No, exactly.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   But the absolute premium of $400 is a lot less than the absolute premium, too.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   If you want to buy the single best car, the absolute premium is massive.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You want to buy the single best stove.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   You can talk about the thing about your model.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Apple's advantage here is that they're the only ones that make the iPhone.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   They're the only ones who have a price for the iPhone.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But so it's apples to oranges.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Sounds like it's not cheap, though.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   No, but look, here's a Moto X, which is a fabulous phone for $450.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   So I think this is...on the one hand, this is a difficult thing for Apple, because there are phones of equal quality that are half as much, but they're not iPhones, because only Apple can make an iPhone.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   So they have an advantage.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Well, in respect to the equal...in respect to the equal quality, I mean, I like the Moto phones.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I think they're quite good.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I would be happy to use one.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   But it is inferior from a build quality perspective.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's inferior from a industrial design perspective.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And it's inferior if you prefer iOS, which a lot of people, including myself, do.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   So I think people are a little too casual to throw out.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's equal.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It's good enough.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   And I get the good enough argument.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   You can certainly have a very fine and productive life with a Moto phone or a whole host of Android phones.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   But that doesn't mean that they're equal.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And the fact of the matter is, in the consumer market, we see this in industry after industry.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   For industry, people are willing to pay a premium for a superior product.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And I think where tech kind of got its head wrapped around an axle is because tech grew up in the enterprise market.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Enterprise market is very much a cost versus features, very kind of like which one matters.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And the user experience isn't really a factor in enterprise buying.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It just isn't.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And so I think a lot of people in tech learned the wrong lessons from that.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And now we're in a consumer market and actually we should be looking at other consumer markets to understand consumer behavior, not look at tech's history.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Well, I think there's no accident that Apple's focused on fashion because fashion is the number one consumer market where features are not the deciding factor.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   You price it based on some imaginary fashion.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Oh, it makes you feel.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Oh, it makes you feel.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Hey, one thing I do want to bring about the low monthly payment plan that Apple's offering.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   If you compare it to other plans from other from the carriers, because all of them in the US do that now, it's fairly comparable, right?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   If you're buying Apple Cara, it's fairly comparable.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   But there is one little, you see this little one here.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   There's one little note that somebody brought up on the radio show that I didn't, I was not aware of, you are required to activate this quote unlocked phone with one of the four major carriers before you take it home.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   You have to.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   You're also be giving Chinese smugglers basically an interest for your own.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Ah, so it's about Chinese smugglers.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Well, just smugglers in general, I mean, imagine because it actually, because I would like to buy an unlocked phone, I would love to do the global market.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Right.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The global market.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   The finance thing is quite aggressive actually.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I mean, because I think if you.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But I have to pay 18 T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon an activation fee to make this like a 50 buck activation fee.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   That that's kind of a hidden cost.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   If you're switching carrier, like you might already have a sim and you can just pop it in there.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   I mean, that's what I do.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I buy unlocked every year and I just take my sim and I stick it in the new phone.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And you activate the phone and then it's okay.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Yeah, there's no fee or anything.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Okay.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I just do it out of spite for the carriers.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I think so.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   So I understand the motivation now.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It's not that the carriers are saying, "Hey Apple, we want that $50."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It's that they're worried about smuggling or global market across US border sales.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   All right.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   But for the consumer, there's something to pay attention to.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   This guy said, "Hey, I use a straight talk.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   I want to buy an unlocked iPhone.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I want to use their financing plan, but I have to activate it when I asked Apple."
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   They said, "Oh yeah, you just activate it and then you deactivate it.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   You cancel the account."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Well, you can use other.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   You can use other.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   If you want to go to a straight talk, there's other things that you can do.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   This is an option that's provided for people who want to use the data.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   It says iPhone activation with a national carrier, AT&T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon, period.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   If you're a straight talk, I mean, like you can still just go buy it.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I don't know if they have sim and free phones available in the US now.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   They do in Canada already.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You can just go buy it.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   You can take advantage of this iPhone upgrade program.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   You can't get the financing.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   That's the deal there.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   That financing comes with AppleCare, the cost of AppleCare built into it.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.800]   It's basically a royalty, an intellectual royalty almost to the carriers that's basically
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:18.000]   saying we're going to maintain our relationships with you by insisting on this activation clause.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yeah, that's what I'm wondering about.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Traditionally, Apple's had the carriers by the short hairs, but for some reason, they're
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   really making you activate with one of the four national carriers on this.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   No, I don't buy any argument that thinks that the carriers make Apple do anything.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Apple says jump and the carriers are like, "We're already up in the air.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Do you want us to go higher?"
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I really think it's this sort of smuggling sort of thing.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's interesting.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   They want to limit to the US market.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   A smuggler is not going to do the installment plan.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's also saying Apple wants one program that just goes everywhere and they don't want to
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   have to negotiate with every small carrier and they don't have to have people set up.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   No, all Apple has to do is say here an unlocked phone, non-activated, not associated with any
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   carrier, you're going to pay us 32 bucks a month.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   We're going to work this out with the bank because you have to do that.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   That's how they do it.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Look, I'd love for it to be a candidate in the UK as well, but they're starting with this
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and it's probably going to expand as time goes on.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   I was going to say the pricing is pretty aggressive, I think, for the upgrade offer.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Apple, if you add up the costs, it's basically the equivalent of buying it up front.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   What I mean with that is Apple is not...
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   It's like a zero percent loan, basically.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Which is interesting in its own right.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I mean, because if you technically calculate the time cost of money, you're actually getting
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   a better deal by doing the upgrade plan.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.500]   But given that, I think that there's no premium in there to justify taking on any additional
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.000]   risks than that's necessary.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And nothing to it, I think, to a running point, it's the first year.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.360]   I think it'll be interesting to see, one is interesting to see how it actually plays out
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   in the stores.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.000]   The last thing the stores need is people having 30 minute appointments to do stuff.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I mean, they're already on that, says it is.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I heard the Apple watch a lot, I think.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.880]   Yeah, no, I think so too.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.000]   And then two, I'm very interested to see how it goes next year.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.120]   Is it our people on the upgrade plan going to be able to get one first stay still?
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   And how is that going to go down?
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.680]   How is it going to be organized?
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.760]   I just think that there's a lot of unknowns about this.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.960]   But that said, that it doesn't change the fact that it's a very interesting development.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.720]   And it's really moving Apple into being two things.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.920]   One, there's only more money to be made in fact, finance anywhere else.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.720]   And two, although like I said, they're not really making much interest here.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.280]   But two, it's almost like you're subscribing to the iPhone.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.800]   And once you are on this upgrade plan, it's very difficult to see you ever not buying
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   an iPhone.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   No, you're in.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   Basically for you to do that.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   And they get to resell the old.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.480]   There's like the lock in of all lock ins.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   Right.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.040]   And they get to resell the old phones, which is lucrative in a lot of markets still, especially
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   emerging markets.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.520]   They've probably recovered a lot of that money, absolutely.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.960]   So the carriers are doing it.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:03.920]   Two hours in, the ordering started 12.01 AM Pacific time on September 12th by 2 AM.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.680]   I'm looking at a website called iphone-inventory.blogspot.com.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.760]   They went out and they looked at the store.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   By two hours in, the iPhone 6 plus pretty much out of stock.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.280]   Three to four weeks delivery time.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.720]   You can get the little one, but everybody's getting the big one.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   And on the few that have delays on the little one, it's the rose.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   Yeah, there weren't that many rose gold ones.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.960]   Same as there weren't that many gold ones last time.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.120]   I mentioned it, if the proportion isn't going to shift much to the plus.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.920]   I mean, because people don't like this.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.280]   The 6 was still much bigger started than the plus by a significant margin.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.080]   What's missing here is we don't know what the availability is.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   Where they're half as many 6 plus.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.760]   There's a popular misconception that big phones were actually popular before the big
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   iPhone.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   They weren't, especially not North America.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.520]   They had a trivial market share and more people were still buying iPhones and buying a lot
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.120]   of the bigger phones combined.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.280]   And I think with the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that began to shift.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.160]   Again, Apple didn't invent the big phone, but they mainstreamed it.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.560]   And now people are seeing that big phones aren't a concern.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.960]   No, I disagree with you.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.600]   Well, in your side of the word, they were popular, Ben.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.960]   They were not popular in North America.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   Right.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   But I think that that was, I mean, people made this argument a lot that, you know, Apple
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.000]   shouldn't make a big iPhone, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.160]   People wanted big iPhones.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.800]   It just happened to be in some markets.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.680]   People wanted an iPhone more than they wanted a big phone.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:32.000]   And yeah, like I said, like you said, in Asia, it was not even close.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.360]   Look at iPhone sales in China, two hours in on the pre-order, two to three week delay
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.960]   for the iPhone 6, eight, three to four week delay for the 6 plus sold out in two hours.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.840]   That is probably very good news for Apple, which had to, of course, reassure Tim Cook
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.920]   had to reassure the markets that despite economic woes in China, there was still a strong market.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   Right, Ben?
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.160]   I mean, this is good news for Apple.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.400]   Oh, for sure.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   I mean, I think the certainly the China question is interesting because Apple is more exposed
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.080]   to China than any other company by, you know, the tech company by a while.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.680]   It's where it's at where there is happening, right?
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Right.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.920]   There's both sides on both the upside and the downside.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.360]   That said, the headroom for China, for Apple in China is absolutely massive.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   And there's just even with these current slowdown, the number of people moving into a middle
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:32.400]   class level of income, which, you know, and the iPhone is basically the thing to get once
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.440]   you can, is basically more than the population of the United States.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:44.400]   And even if there is a slowdown, there's so much slack in the system to take that up
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.320]   that I think Apple will probably be fine.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.520]   It's a valid reason to be concerned, absolutely, because it is Apple's biggest growth market
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.640]   or the growth market.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:31:00.360]   But that said, I think that Cook's statement, which was odd for lots of reasons, but I
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.960]   think it was called a Jim Acremer, yeah.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.200]   You know, I remember going to China, going to a small village, it was an agrarian village.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.800]   I made all their money on pairs or something.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   Their product was.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.880]   And going into a house giant screen TV.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.560]   And our guide explained to me that each year there is a new consumer product that is the
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.200]   thing for the kind of aspirational middle class to have.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.520]   It was air conditioners one year.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.800]   It was big screen TVs.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.200]   I think this is culturally really important to understand.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   So I take it.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:36.680]   It's the iPhone that is the kind of the status symbol for the upwardly mobile in China.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   But this year for the last couple years.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.600]   Well, I mean, there's certainly the whole luxury component and stuff, but that's almost
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   like a higher level up.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.200]   This gets me to find this is kind of the aspiring middle class.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.680]   Yeah, I mean, this gets the absolute price price making early.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.800]   Like this is like an iPhone, you can get an iPhone for $650, you can get the iPhone 5,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.240]   5S now for $450 in China's a little more because there's import taxes and things like
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   that.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:10.560]   The point is you can have the best possible phone, particularly from a status perspective,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.080]   for not that much money.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.320]   I mean, a Louis Vuitton bag starts at what?
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.720]   $1,500 more than that.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   A big one.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   No big is $5,000.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.120]   I mean, so the other and those are from a status perspective, those are in the same
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.200]   class.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.680]   And so you think about it, the fact that even yes, an iPhone is much more expensive than
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.040]   an Android phone, but from an absolute cost basis, it's not that much.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   So in a country like China, of all the things you're going to get first when you arrive,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.640]   like the thing to get when you first arrive is a Louis Vuitton wallet.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.920]   It was a very small little thing and would be like $150, $200 or something.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.440]   And it was kind of a, especially back 10, 12 years ago, it's kind of a running joke.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.560]   That was always the first luxury item that anyone ever got.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.720]   And now that's really the iPhone and the thing is it's not like someone's coming in with
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.040]   an iPhone above it and the iPhone's going to get tired as a brand.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.720]   I mean, the thing with like Louis Vuitton kind of got oversold, right?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.080]   And like people almost got sick of it because it was such a big thing to get.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.800]   And so now it moved up, oh, you got to get a like Hermes or Chanel or whatever, even
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   though they're significantly more expensive.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.640]   What's coming in above the iPhone?
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.960]   You're not going to replace the iPhone with a cheaper product.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.240]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.640]   And so it's kind of had this exclusive hold on the status part of the phone market.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   And that's not going anywhere.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.920]   You got to get that blinged out verto phone if you really want to, you know, that's the
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.480]   thing to do a little bit.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.960]   But I mean, you look like an idiot.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.920]   You don't like an idiot.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.360]   You buy us an help.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   Where was it?
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.560]   There was a verto store and it was in Vegas.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.720]   And I went in there.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   It's weird.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.320]   Oh, they're never they're in every airport in Asia.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.520]   So I always love checking them out.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.360]   Yeah, they're they're they're I mean, they're who I'm there better now because they actually
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   do have like modern versions of Android as opposed to two, three years ago.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.000]   And they're still running like a Symbian.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.520]   So they're actually like functional in usable now.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   Still ridiculous.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.240]   They're luxury mobile phones with exquisite materials and cutting edge technology.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.000]   I should hire you for all their ads.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.520]   I don't think so.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.760]   Signature for Bentley.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.000]   I've got a Bentley phone.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.960]   It's running Symbian, but so what?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.280]   Yikes.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.920]   As technologists, you know, we we we mock this, but I think that that's the point here.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.400]   This isn't about the best technology.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.160]   No, even with the iPhone.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.720]   It's about a status and what's the status object?
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:42.920]   But it's also very clearly aiming at a segment of the market that is the top.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.240]   So it's not the 1%.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.480]   It's the 10%.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.080]   And Apple doesn't want right.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.200]   Apple doesn't want buyers who are price sensitive.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:58.320]   They don't want buyers who are going to that's a that's an overgeneralization.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.120]   But they they're basically they're offering for the price sensitive buyer is you can
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.000]   have our phone from two years ago at a discount.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.600]   But the one that's the one that's being offered today, the new one comes at a premium.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:19.760]   And yes, that that $400 absolute premium might not seem like a lot.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:26.440]   That's your if you're in the top 10% of the Chinese economy, but for or of the United
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.960]   States economy for that matter.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.680]   But if you're in the remaining 90% of the economy, particularly if you're in the bottom
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.000]   50% of the economy, then you're going to be thinking very long and hard about those absolute
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.880]   amounts because those do matter.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.600]   Why does Apple still do to I mean, why do they have the five?
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   What is it?
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   They'll cheap one.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   The free one now is at the five.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   The crappy cheap phones in their opinion.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.960]   So they want to offer something at that price point?
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   What do they even care?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.120]   Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.520]   No, go ahead, Ben.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.960]   Well, I'll just say actually one of the pieces of news that I found most interesting.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   I haven't really yet.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.400]   I think I'm going to try to cover this week, but is the disconnect discontinuation of the
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.000]   five C. Yeah.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And I think much as people want to protest, I think the five C was a failure.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.840]   And the reason it was a failure though is very interesting.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.160]   And the reason was a failure is because it looked at first sight like it was a cheaper
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   iPhone.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   Right.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.800]   And the difference is when you go buy a 5S today, it looks like when you fall that out
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.080]   and put on the table, you don't know if it just happens to be your two year old phone
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.640]   or your one year old phone or when you just when you just bought it.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:40.240]   It's still, yes, certainly it's ideal from a status perspective to have the most current
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   model.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.080]   And you know, I'll get a glorify in the one the US and get shipped over and I'll have
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.720]   it a few weeks for when Taiwan does and I can launch it on the subway and go on the
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   stash.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:57.760]   But you either have an iPhone, like I think I just use an Apple tagline, but either have
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.400]   an iPhone or you don't.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:06.040]   And the thing with the five C is the five C was never really an iPhone for this specific
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   angle of things because it was from day one, not the flagship iPhone.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.080]   And so I think it's interesting that it was discontinued.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.800]   I thought they might keep it and try to really drive down prices with that model specifically.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:25.640]   But I think they've decided and probably rightly so that this value of status is worth more
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.920]   than whatever incremental new customers we could get by having say a $350 phone, which
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   is interesting.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.720]   You can certainly see both arguments for it.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   It's amazing.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   It was an exciting experience.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   I'm glad they tried it.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.280]   Half an hour into the conversation, we haven't mentioned specs.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   We haven't mentioned features.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.440]   And that's kind of how Apple wants it really.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   You're right.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.080]   You either have an iPhone or you don't.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   Period.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.440]   I do want to talk about what I think was a revolutionary new product.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.160]   And we could talk about this 3D touch, rebranded force touch, whether it works or not.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   You guys have played with it.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.600]   You can tell me Apple TV, a lot of stuff still to come.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.120]   Maybe even we'll squeeze in a Google story or a Twitter story if I could find one.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   Android Pay launch.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   I don't know.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   What does it mean?
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.280]   And why was Microsoft on the stage at the Apple event, shades of Bill Gates towering over
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.400]   Steve Jobs.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.680]   But first, let's talk about wealth and wealth front.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.200]   Many of you, of course, I hope are saving for your future, whether it's to buy a house,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.280]   to retire.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.960]   How are you investing your money for the long term?
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.560]   I'm not talking about your short term trades.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.280]   I'm talking about the money you're putting aside.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.120]   You don't want to put in a savings account.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.280]   You want it to grow.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.760]   But do you have the time to manage it?
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.840]   Are you going to pay an advisor to management?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.600]   Traditional advisors charge huge fees.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.080]   We're talking 1% to 3% of the money you have under management.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.600]   Not to mention additional fees for transactions.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.840]   And it starts to add up.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   Every one of those things is just to eat in a way at your savings.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.400]   Wealth front is so cool.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.880]   It's a new way to do it.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.360]   You don't have to worry about it.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.600]   Put your investments on autopilot.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.360]   It's done programmatically.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.960]   Wealth front makes it easy and affordable for anyone to access world class long term investment
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.440]   management using solid principles.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.600]   You could start with as little as $500 right now.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.480]   And here's the best part.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.360]   One quarter of 1% a year.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.880]   That's 25 basis points.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.040]   And there are never any commissions.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.480]   There are no hidden fees.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.240]   We're no additional charges for any Wealthfront services.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.960]   It's really an amazing system.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.260]   The Wealthfront team includes some of the smartest thinkers about Wall Street, including the
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.720]   authors of two seminal books.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.920]   I remember reading as a younger man, Burton Malkiel's amazing random walk down Wall Street.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.640]   Charles Ellis is winning the Loser Games.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:05.520]   These are guys who understand how Wall Street works, understand the mistakes that normal
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.880]   people make.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.520]   And they've built this into the sophisticated software that runs Wealthfront.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.680]   Wealthfront is completely transparent.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.960]   You will view your accounts, all of them in one place, whether it's personal, joint, retirement.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.520]   And yes, you can have all three.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.960]   You'll see every trade they make on your behalf right there in the dashboard, or you
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.200]   can use their mobile app.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.000]   And they're using sophisticated strategies that are very difficult for others to do.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.600]   Things like tax loss harvesting and direct in this thing that maximize after tax returns.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.800]   They lower your tax bill, increase your returns.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.920]   No wonder Wealthfront has grown 20 times in the past two years or 20 times bigger.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.600]   Now $2.6 billion in client assets.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   That number was $2.4 billion in the copy I'm reading here.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.680]   And now I see on the website it's $2.6 billion.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.800]   They're growing fast.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   It's incredible.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   I want you to try it.

[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   What a great show.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.560]   I've been looking forward to this all week.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.720]   I didn't get to talk during the event.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.320]   So I have all these ideas churning in my mind.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.280]   And I thought, who better than Ed Bot from ZDNet?
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:40.160]   Renee Ritchie from iamore.com as a trajectories brilliant analyst Ben Thompson all talking
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   about what's going on.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:49.640]   And I think whether you're an iOS, iPhone, Android user doesn't, it's not the point.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.440]   This is the technology industry.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.960]   One of the real movers in the industry.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.800]   And this isn't, you know, I look at these events and I think, God, I wish they wouldn't
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.640]   say all these superlatives, the best ever.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.200]   It sounds too much like a marketing event.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.400]   And so I think it's really important for us as analysts to kind of burn off the marketing
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.800]   hype because that's just bogus and really try to understand what Apple's doing.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.360]   And I think we couldn't have a better team for doing that.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.160]   And I thought we'd have a little battle between Ed Bot and Ben Thompson right now.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.840]   And Renee, you know Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.040]   So if you want to just throw in, you can tag and get in there.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.520]   Ben worked at Microsoft and Apple.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   He's the swing vote here.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.240]   Well, I want the surface versus the first time.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   Exactly.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.360]   So I really thought, and you, I don't want to put words in your mouth, Ed Bot, but I'm
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:48.320]   looking here, especially at that crappy keyboard and thinking, this is a surface clone.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.440]   The iPad pro.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.960]   Do you feel that way, Ed?
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.840]   Not, not really.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.640]   I, you know, it's, I was really hoping I could be.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.280]   Is Tia Muppy Neil.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:07.320]   No, you know, because if you go back to the original iPad launch, I'm pretty certain that
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:14.560]   they showed a keyboard case for it in like the first 20, Steve Jobs had a keyboard case
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   for that 20 minutes.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   Keyboard stands.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.600]   They had a stand and then they, as meant to be the Apple keyboard, but yeah, no, it's
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   spot on and they also demoed it.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:29.120]   The demo apps were, were pages and, you know, so, you know, they thought that the original
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.920]   iPad was going to be kind of a net book killer.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   Interesting.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   And, and it turned out to be more of a, and, you know, and the joke at the time was that
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.280]   people said the iPad is just going to be a big iPhone that doesn't make phone calls.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.520]   And it turned out that was completely true and it was a good thing for Apple and it was
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.800]   a good thing for people who bought the original iPads because that's exactly what they wanted.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.480]   So now they're sort of, you know, with the volume of iPad shipments going down, I think
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:05.240]   they're sort of looking at the, at the overall brand and the overall value proposition of
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:12.920]   iPad and saying there are a lot of people who use this as a laptop replacement.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.120]   I spend a lot of time, Vandy spent a lot of time in airports.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.280]   I spend a lot of time in airports, Renee, you do too.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.920]   We see a lot of people with iPads.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   Yes.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.200]   Talk to these weird ugly keyboard cases.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.640]   And they're trying to, they're trying to do things with them.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.240]   And so I think Apple is just responding to the market here.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:38.440]   And now, to me, that disconnect with the iPad Pro is not that it's a surface clone, but
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:46.080]   that they're trying to appeal in terms of size and screen quality to creative professionals.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   But creative professionals want full Photoshop.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.880]   They want full Final Cut Pro.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.560]   They want full Premiere.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:00.720]   And the limited capabilities of the apps in the iPad Pro are going to be the limiting
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:07.040]   factor for it in terms of acceptance, at least in the first year, I think.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.720]   I almost wish they hadn't released the keyboard because I think that Muddy's the waters.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.920]   I think really the iPad Pro, it's all about the pencil on the screen.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.560]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.560]   Go ahead.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.560]   I'll go last.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   Okay.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.120]   So Renee and then you've been and I'm going to shut up.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.280]   My background is in design.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.400]   I worked for 10 years in design using Wacom tablets almost every day.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.760]   And I grew up in Photoshop.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.480]   Photoshop is still muscle memory for me.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.560]   And I actually like the way that the iPad Pro worked with the pencil a lot.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   It is absolutely the best dialess I have ever used.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.000]   Way better than any Wacom tablet I've ever used because the response rate is great.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.520]   They're actually doing predictive algorithms that you can watch sometimes self correct.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   They stay up with you.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.240]   You can scribble, you can cross hatch.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.760]   The tilting is fantastic.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.560]   I tried Procreate, which Photoshop is never really known who it's for.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.160]   Like previously it was for photographers now they're trying to make it for UI designers.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.840]   And I've always used things like Factual Design Painter and Illustrator and just different
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.240]   tools for the right job.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.520]   And that's what the iPad kind of felt like when I looked at the different 3D apps and
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.640]   the different drawing apps.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.240]   It really looked like you could purpose build something that was really good.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.720]   Now I am a Final Cut Pro user and I don't know how it's going to translate to iMovie
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.880]   even with three simultaneous 4K streams or whatever because I don't know how I'll be able
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.320]   to cut and do things as precisely as I want.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.360]   But when I get one I'll give it a try.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.760]   But I think for a lot of people I've wanted to buy a surface just to sit there and draw
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.600]   with it because Apple did not for that functionality.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   But there was nothing else about it that I was really going to use.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.360]   Now I have that built into an iPad.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.640]   And conversely there are exactly those people that Ed's been talking about who are using
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.240]   keyboards and Apple because of the MacBook has gotten really good at making super low
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.800]   profile keyboards.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.880]   And I tried it out for a while and it feels like using a MacBook keyboard.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.840]   So if that's who you want, if you are that productivity person or the creative person,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.280]   they've sort of got the tool that fits whatever you want to do.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.960]   Well, I just think about the keyboard.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.680]   I thought the keyboard was terrible.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.880]   Do you like the MacBook keyboard?
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:10.640]   I thought it was much worse than the MacBook keyboard which was, I only used it briefly.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.800]   But I definitely think the surface keyboard is better.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.040]   And for the record the way it plugs into the side of the iPad and does power back and forth.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.400]   I mean that's what the surface did absolutely.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.600]   That's Pogo pins Apple style.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.320]   Well, I mean so that said I do, well I have a few points I would make.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:35.560]   First off I do reject that it's a surface rip off because the surface is a PC with a
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.720]   touch layer that you can use.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:43.960]   And the iPad is a touch OS from the ground up that you can put a keyboard on in type
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   on.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:51.480]   And if that sounds trivial, I think that it's trivial in a very fundamental way in that
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.760]   we talked before about the consumer market being different than the business market.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.480]   The consumer market is driven much more by the user experience.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.640]   And the user experience has to be optimal I think for you to be successful.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   And by extension I think this sort of hybrid mashup approach is not the upper one.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.720]   I know some people like the surface.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   I'm not a fan.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.200]   The reason I'm not a fan is because I think Windows is a PC operating system.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.480]   And I think a PC mouse and keyboard operating system, the form factor of laptop is just
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   better.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.040]   People, you can do more with it.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.880]   How many people do you see using a surface without the keyboard?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.800]   Not barely anyone.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.400]   And I think that's a shortcoming.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.840]   On the other hand, Leo, I think you're exactly right.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:42.880]   I think there's these two accessories signify two different potential futures and markets
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.480]   for the iPad.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.960]   The keyboard is the iPad as a PC replacement.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.280]   And yet in some respects it's better.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.120]   It's simpler, it's easier, the app store and the Reddit kind of sort of stuff.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   In other respects it's worse.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.440]   I think the form factor is worse.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.520]   And I think that the power and capability is worse.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.720]   On the other hand, this pencil thing, you nail it on the head.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.360]   It's really good.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.400]   It's as opposed to the surface or a walk-on tablet or any other thing that uses a digitizer.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.800]   You don't have that big gap between where you're drawing and the actual screen where
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.360]   you get this weird parallax effect when actually using it.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.440]   And the responsive rate is incredible.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.040]   It's by far the best that I've ever seen.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.920]   It looks incredible in the video.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.040]   Oh, it's by far the killer feature of the thing.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:38.200]   And to me, what's so exciting about this is I don't use my iPad for anything but for
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.360]   one app and that's paper by 53, which I create illustrations for my blog.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.200]   That's how you do those napkin illustrations?
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.320]   Yeah, no, exactly.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.960]   And basically I buy an iPad because there's one thing I can do in the iPad, the 353 that
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.320]   I can't do on a PC, I can't do on a phone.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:03.280]   And that is what the pencil I hope leads to is more of these sorts of applications that
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.480]   can only be done on an iPad.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   Or alternatively, maybe on a $2,000 walk-on tablet connected to a PC, which is already
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.240]   going to be an inferior experience anyway.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.960]   And I'm much more excited about the pencil future than I am about the keyboard future.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.040]   My initial reaction, I'm watching this announcement, first of all, shocked that Apple led with
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   it.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.920]   I mean, there was the watch OS stuff, but then really the big first piece of hardware and
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.480]   it shocked me when Tim Cook said, "All right, let's talk iPad."
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.240]   It was like, "Really?"
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.760]   But looking at it, I felt like we were seeing a paradigm shift in computing.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.900]   I think this is really important.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:48.780]   This is the move from desktop keyboard and mouse computing to touch-first computing.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.520]   And I think, and you make an excellent point in your article, by the way.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.480]   In fact, the title tells it says it all from products to platforms.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.660]   The iPad is no longer a product.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:05.740]   If Apple does this right, a new platform, but you say, and I think you're exactly right,
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.000]   that Apple's got to adjust its App Store policies if it's going to make this work.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.200]   It's going to come down to software.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.880]   Now I didn't get to play with it, but I'm really gathering from those who did from you
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:21.040]   guys and others that you look at something like iMovie or GarageBand, Apple Apps.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.920]   It is not just, any more than the iPad was a blown up iPhone.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.240]   It's not just a bigger iPad.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.280]   Something happens when you get to that size, that it is a natural UI for certain categories
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.680]   of applications.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:39.360]   It's a much more natural way to work.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:45.800]   If appropriate applications are developed for this platform, it will really have us rethinking
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.960]   the way we use computers.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.880]   Before the show, and we probably should make a special out of it, we had Etty on who is
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.440]   the Evie, right?
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:02.000]   The developer of something called UMake, Phil Schiller, showed it on the screen during
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   the keynote at umake.xyz.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.600]   This app isn't out yet.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.040]   He won't say, but apparently they've been working with Apple because this is very much
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.960]   what Apple wants for the iPad Pro.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   They're going to release it.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   I'm trying to try it as terrific.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.680]   Yeah, I was playing with it.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.600]   It's a 3D design program that you use the pencil and your fingers to design stuff.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:32.000]   They actually show me a car that's already been designed with this as beta testers.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.280]   To me, I feel like the iPad Pro is a new form of computing.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   Is that going to be fun?
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.960]   The interface is different, too.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.640]   It's not just a blown up iPad area either because of size classes.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   Now you can actually expose more interface on the iPad Pro than you can even on the iPad
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.640]   area.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   You can have extra palettes.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.040]   It's almost like the 5K iMac.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.960]   You can have extra stuff there so you don't lose the usable area.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.560]   You just gain utility.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   And that was super impressive.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.680]   It underscores to me the mistake that was Windows 8 and is continuing with Windows
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   10.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.880]   Microsoft misunderstood what people wanted to use Windows for.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.280]   That's a desktop OS.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.080]   Trying to shoehorn touch into that is not the solution.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.600]   It's the same reason why OS 10 shouldn't have touch stuck in there.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.240]   Apple now has two separate platforms.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.520]   And I think this is a maturation of iOS that was to me anyway, somewhat unexpected and
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520]   very exciting.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.400]   Super interesting thing here, Leo, is the way that Apple is doing this.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.680]   They have essentially, you can quill about how much OS 10 is like iOS.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   But on the other products, you have backboard and frontboard.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.400]   And you have that on the iPhone with springboard.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.720]   You have that on the watch with carousel.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.040]   You have that on the Apple TV with pine board and headboard.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.800]   And now they're starting to differentiate the iPad.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.520]   I still want them to go full out and make a completely unique version of springboard
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.760]   just for the iPad.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.520]   But they're doing things like split screen and slide over and they're letting it be
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.520]   its own thing.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.760]   And if you logically extend that towards the future, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.580]   As much as the MacBook is sort of closer to an iPad than a Mac, this is sort of closer
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.240]   to what you traditionally use as a computer than an iPad before.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.640]   And I think there is a very interesting space for them to explore there.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.840]   Evie said, this is like minority report.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.480]   You know, we're all thinking about gesture based computing.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   Forget that.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   It's very natural.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.360]   You've got a screen, you touch the screen, you use the pencil.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.480]   You're intimately connected with the stuff that you're doing.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.440]   But Ben, you make an interesting point.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:25.920]   I mean, really, whether this happens or not depends a lot on what Apple does, especially
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   with the App Store.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:33.800]   Well, I mean, I think that to your point, Leo, there were, this was already to a degree
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.960]   possible on the iPad as it was.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:43.400]   But I think your point is well made that especially for these creative sort of applications.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.160]   And you know, the whole thing that's frustrating with the whole creation versus consumption
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:51.680]   debate is that creation was so often like presumably just text input, whereas the iPad,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.640]   what's exciting with the iPad is arguably it's a superior input device for everything
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.720]   but text input because of its adaptability to any sort of, you know, it's not just the
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.400]   touch aspect, but also it becomes the appropriate interface, you know, to whatever it should
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   be.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   I tell students buy a Chromebook.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.860]   Don't buy an iPad.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.160]   Schools are crazy to buy iPads because what's the, what students do is type.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.160]   I'm a huge Chromebook fan.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:20.800]   You know, the Chromebook plus iPhone combination is probably the best for the majority of people
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   out there.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   But there's a huge category of new applications.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:29.760]   This is the, this is a few makes video that compares traditional CAD software with using
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.960]   UMake to do the same kind of design thing.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.600]   And I think after you use this kind of thing for a while, you might say, Hey, that mouse
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   and keyboard, that's the crappiest way to do it.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   Did you see a Dolby Leo?
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.040]   I used to use InDesign every day and the speed with which they did a layout on a page on
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.640]   the iPad Pro is amazing to me.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.280]   I just draw the box, make a big X in it.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.840]   Suddenly that's a graphic holder, make a box, put two lines in it.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.000]   Suddenly that's a text column.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.040]   When you make a platform though, you're really dependent on independent software.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:57:01.560]   Quickly and easily we can, we look how quickly and easily we can enhance bad stereotypes.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:07.520]   It's also, I mean, we, we, we must not forget, first of all, the size and weight of this
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.720]   device is intimidating for a lot of people.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.680]   You're not going to put this in your purse.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.240]   And the cost is intimidating for a lot of people.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.680]   And it may, yes, it's less than a BMW.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.520]   Less than a workstation too.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.560]   I mean, you're selling this people who use workstations.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.560]   This is not.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   Yeah, but it's not a workstation.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.960]   It has very, it has some very nice graphics in it, but it only has four gigabytes of RAM
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:33.960]   in it.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:39.120]   And as my, my colleague, Jason Perlow, and ZDN wrote a very interesting article published
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:45.200]   I think today or last night, you know, saying, basically laying out the case for this and
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   it really requires a lot of cloud power on the back end for a device like this to do
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.200]   its work.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.040]   I think there was a, there was a demo that they showed.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.240]   Well, because there's, because a lot of the things that they're showing off demand a whole
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.880]   bunch of data to be processed.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:11.400]   And there four gigabytes of RAM is not, is not a lot of workspace.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:16.560]   Most creative professionals are working on machines that have 32 gigabytes of RAM on
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.560]   it, not four.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.440]   Yeah, because they're using heavyweight operating systems that do.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.920]   It's not just the operating system.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.680]   It's the size of the file.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.680]   The data.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.760]   It's the size of the, the, the transforms that you're doing.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.800]   You know, this is, this is a very interesting device, but it's very early.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:43.840]   And in some ways it's a piece of glass with, with very nice responsive capabilities that
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:50.520]   needs some serious processing power on the back end to, to really do, to do its magic.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:57.280]   You're not going to be looking at raw x-rays on this thing all by itself.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   You know, we were at the meetup.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.640]   We had a great meetup, by the way.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:04.160]   Thanks to everybody who came up on Wednesday at New York City's Rattle and Hum Bar, which
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.400]   is so much fun.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   You've been there, Ed.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.040]   I'm sure with Mary Jo Foley.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.040]   I have.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.760]   It's so great.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.080]   But a guy came up, he said, I'm a neurosurgeon.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.840]   And he said, I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it because I've got eight patients
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.640]   that I'm monitoring right now.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   He had, what was he using?
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.800]   Was he using an iPad or was he using a laptop?
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   He was using a laptop, but I could see him doing this on an iPad Pro.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.440]   He's monitoring eight different patients at different hospitals.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:34.920]   I guess this stuff, radiology, this has happened, has been outsourced now to groups.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.720]   And drinking while he's monitoring eight patients?
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.200]   I said, aren't you worried?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.000]   He said, nah, it's only one guy now.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.960]   And I think he's going to be okay.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.240]   I don't know exactly how this works or what he's doing, but there, he's got these graphs
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.960]   and these things and he's looking at them while he's, yeah, while he's having a beer.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.200]   So they showed that on the watch, they showed heart rate monitoring on the watch.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.760]   This was a little more sophisticated than that.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.240]   I mean, these guys are hooked up to a lot of stuff.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.440]   They've had neurosurgery, I guess, and they're being monitored after the fact.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.200]   I'm not sure what he's doing.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.600]   But at the point being that there's, yes, okay, I agree with you, Ed.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.880]   I think your colleague and you are exactly right.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.120]   You need some, but isn't this the era of the cloud?
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   I don't think that's--
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.440]   There's also local, like I often will just pick up my iPad continuity up a document, work
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.280]   on it with fingers because that feels more natural to me and then go back to my Mac
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.960]   continuity up again and continue when I want to use the mouse for the bigger storage.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.200]   And I think we're getting to a world where Google definitely made the cloud more seamless.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.080]   And I think Apple is making, moving between devices more seamless as well.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:44.480]   So I think there's lots of good and points that are kind of not necessarily--
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.480]   So one, I think for some--
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Fix this up, and--
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   Fix this up, Ben.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   What I can write is edit us here.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.880]   Edit is exactly right that it is expensive.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:57.280]   And the iPad is at a very kind of fundamental perspective, more expensive than the phone.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.800]   The five-- put it this way, the $500 iPad is more expensive than the $650 iPhone.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.240]   And the reason it's more expensive is because the iPad is an and purchase.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.000]   You're going to buy a phone regardless, right?
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.640]   So you had that Moto in your hand, right?
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.360]   It was $400.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.840]   So in that world, the iPhone is not a $650 phone.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.480]   It's a $250 phone.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.720]   I mean, because you're paying a $250 premium to have an iPhone.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.400]   In the case of an iPad, you don't necessarily need to have a tablet.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.800]   So every dollar that the iPad costs is a dollar that you're electing to pay.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:40.120]   And in that respect, the iPad is always a harder sale than the iPhone is.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.880]   That said, I would disagree with you, Adam.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.040]   The cloud capability is an issue.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   I think that's the way computing is going.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:52.000]   And quite frankly, Microsoft is a big leader in this respect where that makes sense where
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.160]   you have the local processing handles, the local UI, and you have that sort of interface.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:02.240]   And that was kind of what the old net-- not netbooks, the real netbooks, the net gear,
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.760]   like they were doing where you would have the pure terminal on one end.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.760]   The thin client.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   Yeah, thin clients.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.920]   Yeah, that's what they got wrong, right?
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.960]   They didn't have enough-- the user experience wasn't good enough because they put too much
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.000]   in the cloud.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.080]   But I think a hybrid approach-- I'm not objecting to that.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:27.040]   What I think the key thing, though, that did hit on with this being expensive is that the
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.920]   iPad is-- and even more so today than it ever was, especially with iPhones getting bigger
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.280]   and more capable, it is a niche device.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.520]   And it will always be a niche device.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.880]   And given that, I don't object to Apple releasing a more expensive, more souped up, more powerful
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   version because that's exactly how you should respond to being in a niche market.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.200]   There's two kind of big strategies.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.480]   One is a general purpose market, why it's better.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.440]   You want to reach as many people as possible, make it up in volume.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.880]   The other one is the niche market where your goal is not volume.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.560]   Your goal is maximizing revenue per consumer or per buyer.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.160]   And the iPad Pro does that.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.800]   If you're someone who actually uses an iPad for things that can only be done in an iPad,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.440]   an iPad Pro is better.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.480]   It's more expensive, all of which is a good thing for everyone involved.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:23.200]   And the issue, the worry, the concern for the iPad from my perspective is that the app
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.800]   makers for iPad are also going to be niche providers.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.280]   And a niche provider, like I said, needs to maximize a revenue per consumer.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.760]   And that's the exact thing that the app store does not currently allow.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   The app store is all about being a volume play.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.120]   It's not about maximizing revenue per your consumer over time.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.520]   And that's the big concern is Apple doesn't have the business model, I think, to support
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.480]   the sort of apps that will make the iPad Pro a super powerful and compelling device and
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.080]   to reach the potential that you wait out, Leo.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.360]   Surely they can flip a switch and say, well, we're going to have trials.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.440]   We're going to have, you know, I mean, can't they make that work?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.000]   It's not a question of trials.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   It's a question of these are apps.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.360]   The amount of work and the amount of development effort that needs to go into these powerful
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.600]   apps that need to run for a limited market of people, those apps need to be sold at $200,
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.760]   $300, $400 each, not $5 each.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.600]   I mean, they could be, but it's an expectation thing, right?
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.000]   I mean, and the technology is pushing them in the wrong direction.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.320]   Like Apple really wants universal apps because that's, you know, it looks like an iPhone
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   app.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.280]   But that's also what's filling up the slide over and what's filling up the very slim version
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   of side view.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.880]   So you make that and you make a universal app, charge 50 bucks on the iPad Pro, but like
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.080]   do you artificially restricted against the iPhone because people aren't going to pay
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.640]   $50 for an iPhone app.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.000]   They've set up an incredible, not just Apple.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   We've decided we want to pay for things.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.600]   Apple's decided they don't want to, they don't want to increase the value of the platform
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.680]   and developers have often raced to the bottom.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.760]   And we've got the sum of all these compromises right now.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   And I agree.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   I understand it with Ben.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.240]   Well, the thing is, is this, I don't think any of you made that, but I'm going to pretend
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.000]   like you did so I can push back against it.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.800]   I pushed back against the contention.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.840]   And that, that, a lot of people do state and particularly in the Apple developer community
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:10.640]   that this is inevitable because we're in a world and I've contributed this.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.120]   I wrote an article a couple of years ago explaining how software by definition has zero marginal
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.800]   value, which means undifferentiated software will eventually cost zero dollars because
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.280]   especially in a very competitive environment like the iPhone.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.920]   And that's true.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.120]   But the keyword there is undifferentiated.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:36.880]   If it was always the case that highly reputable content with zero marginal cost could not
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.480]   be charged for, then I'd be screwed.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.760]   Like I sell text on the internet.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.520]   It's like the most competitive environment in the history of humanity.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.440]   But it works because some number of people find it to be worth, worth paying for.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:57.820]   And the challenge for an app maker is that there is no way to, to articulate your value.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:04.000]   And because if you go in the app store and there's an app that costs $100 or $500 or $5,000
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.460]   or $5,000 by the way, the apps are women, it's $9.99.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.420]   You can't demonstrate your value to consumers.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:16.740]   Absent them buying it and like contacting you separately for a refund and then doing this
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.740]   weird product.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.740]   Like it's a total mess.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.900]   And this is why I think things like trials are actually super important because they're
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:27.460]   a way for differentiated apps to demonstrate their differentiation and to drive purchase.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.100]   And so that fixes the revenue per consumer angle because now you can get more per customer.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.740]   And this is way more important than Apple taking 30% or things like that that people
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.740]   focus on.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.980]   The prop 30% of a dollar isn't very important.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:45.140]   Like the big issue is that top line number, how much can you drive?
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.020]   And that's why, and this is something that Microsoft understands.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:54.180]   And this is, I made the joke that the iPad would argue would be better if Microsoft owned
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.780]   it because Microsoft is a platform company.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.580]   They get that, they understand what developers need, they understand how to create the environment
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.220]   for developers to make money.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.980]   And Microsoft, like one of the key things, every time you go to a Microsoft developer
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.300]   conference, like they have a huge one every year, their sales conference, whatever, they
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.220]   always show the slide that shows the value of the total Windows ecosystem and how much
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.500]   Microsoft harvests.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.940]   And they brag about the fact that, oh, of the total value of the Windows ecosystem, we
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.260]   keep 24% or 27% of it.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.820]   And their point there is that we're invested in making a big pie for everyone.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.260]   We're not out to get all the money for ourselves.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.060]   And Apple does the exact opposite.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:36.140]   Apple is this pure, like hardcore, like we're going to commoditize our compliments.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.780]   It means all the parts that we don't make money on, we're going to make them as cheap
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.040]   as possible.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.500]   And in the short run that works, and it works on the iPhone, and it works on the iPhone
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.980]   because the iPhone, the most important apps are social networks or communication networks
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.740]   or things that where we keep in touch.
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.980]   And those games have to be free.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:57.060]   Well, the game's point is interesting because games started out as it was an okay market.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:03.700]   What set fire to the games market was Apple one, enabling in-app purchases and then two,
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.460]   enabling in-app purchases for consumables, which is where you can buy the same thing
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.540]   over and over again.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.460]   And that, where you can buy 10 points or whatever.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:16.580]   And that is what led to the game's explosion on the iPhone because it's not enough to just
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.060]   have all this amazing graphics capability.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:24.500]   You also have to have a reason to invest the money to take advantage of that capability,
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.340]   which means you have to have a business model that supports it.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.780]   The iPhone and iOS does have that business model for games and it has a thriving game's
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.300]   ecosystem as a result.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:38.480]   The concern here is for other apps, for productivity type apps, especially ones that don't have
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.640]   a service component.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.900]   If you have a service component, you can charge a subscription and that kind of makes sense.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   But if you have a self-contained app, there's no way one to demonstrate your values should
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.300]   get more money and two, because there's no upgrade pricing and no way to communicate
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.060]   with your current customers, you can't extract more money to your same customers over time.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.340]   It's always easier to get money from the same customers than it is to find new ones.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:07.260]   And that capability is just not simple at all on iOS.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:13.020]   And Apple could unlock this, but I just feel there's such a product-focused company and
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.180]   that's to their benefit.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.540]   That's why they have a platform in the first place.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.620]   Again, in the consumer market, you win with a great product.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.540]   You get a great product and then you have the right to be a platform.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.820]   That's Microsoft problem.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.900]   They don't have the product to become a platform, the consumer market.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.100]   They don't have the enterprise leverage anymore that they used to have.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.300]   And so Microsoft's sitting on the side, this great platform company that doesn't have a
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300]   platform.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.500]   And Apple's on this side, this great product company that has a platform they don't seem
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.940]   to know what to do with.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.500]   And it's frustrating because it's not like these developers would go to another tablet.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.460]   There is no other tablet with customers with a demonstrated willingness to pay.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.940]   Apple owns all those customers.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.500]   And there's all this class of App Store.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.380]   You're so excited about the future of computing.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.620]   So am I, but I'm also worried it's going to never happen because the business conditions
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.620]   were never in place.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.620]   Sorry.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:02.620]   >> What I'd really like to see from Apple is a vice president of App Store that's sort
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.900]   of analogous to what Angel Aran's is for retail.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.340]   And as someone whose only job it is to wake up in the morning and decide how to make the
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.500]   App Store a tremendous product, as good a product as an iPhone or an iPad.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.900]   Because right now App Store is bifurcate or even trifurcate.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.580]   You have Craig Federighi's org who makes all the frameworks.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.700]   You have Phil Schiller's org which does App Review and Evangelism.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:25.500]   You have Eddie Q's org which does store management and editorial and runs the actual store.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.020]   And without one person sort of making that a fantastic problem, sorry, a fantastic product,
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.580]   you just have, again, the same thing where people aren't always on the same page and
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:39.940]   it shows, like Ben's favorite app, Paper, they stop charging money to make money off
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]   the pencil.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.380]   Apple is making a pencil and what are they going to make money on?
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.620]   I love that app too and I want that app to be here.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.300]   I want to give developers money.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.260]   I just want better ways of doing it.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:54.940]   >> Ed bot, isn't this kind of a problem that Microsoft solved with its unified App Store
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.980]   and one Windows solution?
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.460]   Isn't that what they're addressing?
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.820]   Or is Microsoft going to have the same problem?
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:09.420]   >> I think in a way, both Apple and Microsoft are converging on the same point from different
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   directions.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:17.660]   Microsoft's historical strength has been understanding price sensitive, efficiency sensitive, business
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.260]   customers.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:28.540]   Apple's historical strength has been understanding non-price sensitive, very quality sensitive
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.540]   consumers.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:37.460]   And so they're both trying to aim towards a point, Microsoft trying to get some traction
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:43.300]   in the consumer space, which they're getting maybe a little better at but not too.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:49.060]   And Apple trying but only halfheartedly, I think, to get into the business and enterprise
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:56.980]   space because they realize that the margins there and the cell cycles are so long and
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:03.700]   so difficult that they almost, I think, want to concede that market and say, "We're
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.420]   going to be happy playing in the high end here where the margins are high and we'll leave
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.420]   the enterprise to Microsoft."
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:16.660]   It's almost like it creates a world where sometime in the future, Microsoft and Apple
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:27.220]   merge just to sort of create the Venn diagram that has those customers working properly.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.860]   >> I feel like Microsoft solved this, though, somewhat with Office 365.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:37.020]   This is a really good example of a way they've monetized what was a huge cash cow, their
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:43.380]   number two product, by charging a subscription fee and you get it free if you've paid that
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.700]   subscription free on the iPad.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:51.900]   And then, in fact, they have a very nice touch first version of the Office apps, works quite
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.900]   well on the iPad.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.820]   I think will probably work even better on the iPad Pro.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.860]   But they get their money from that monthly subscription fee.
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:02.700]   >> But it's almost unique.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:12.140]   Office is historically this, it's a legacy product that has survived and thrived and
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:17.660]   there are very, very, very few things that you can put into the same class as it.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.820]   Adobe has been trying to do the same thing when it's creative cloud products.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.820]   >> I think they have created cloud products.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.820]   >> I would guess.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.540]   >> Adobe's been very successful and it's actually one of the more, I think, under-report and
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.540]   under-appreciated stories with it.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.580]   Adobe has been created from the Reddit model subscription.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.900]   We have a number of them here.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.660]   We have the high-end subscriptions for the editors.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.380]   I just have the photography one, 10 bucks a month.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.260]   I get a Photoshop and Lightroom.
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.700]   That's a great deal for me.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   And I imagine I will get a free Lightroom app, maybe even a free touch first Photoshop
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.940]   app on the iPad Pro as a result.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.500]   >> The difference, though, and I think as driving at that is a big reason why Adobe and
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:01.340]   Microsoft were able to pull this off is because they already have the established mind share.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.340]   And like- >> Exactly.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   >> Exactly.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.980]   >> Adobe said you're switching to creative cloud whether you like it or not.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.980]   And basically everyone has still walked into Photoshop that they had no choice but go against
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:10.980]   it.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.220]   And there was a lot of welling and gnashing of teeth and things like that.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.780]   And if you're a new developer, particularly on the iPad, the whole lure of the iPad Leo
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:23.500]   is that you can make an app on the iPad that you can't make anywhere else.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.260]   That's the potential.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:33.060]   And it's harder to explain to consumers why you should pay a subscription fee for an app
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.540]   that's limited to one device.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.780]   >> So there's no desktop market for that kind of thing.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.540]   >> You saw the web, you saw the web, you saw it on your thing, all that sort of stuff.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540]   >> How about cloud services?
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.540]   Can you charge for that?
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.340]   >> Well, I mean, yes, you can.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.500]   So two things.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500]   One, yes, you can.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.100]   But two, a lot of apps don't necessarily have a natural service component.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.220]   Like paper, for example, they are building a cloud service.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.060]   And they're building a cloud service as far as I can tell, primarily to monetize, not
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.460]   because the app actually needs a cloud service.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.620]   But the thing that frust me about this argument is that it's not that you guys are wrong.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.340]   There are ways to monetize.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:13.420]   The issue is I would like to stop with the let's figure out how to overcome Apple's limitations
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.100]   and let's dwell on Apple's limitations and stop making excuses for them and finding ways
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.100]   around them.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.180]   The fact of the matter is there's no reason for Apple to not support stuff like this beyond
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.860]   and as far as I can tell, and this was what was so ironic about Microsoft and Adobe being
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:33.260]   on stage, the fact that Apple never again wants to be held captive to an app developer.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:39.260]   You go back to 1997, Mac world Boston, and Steve Jobs and his stand on stage and talk
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.860]   about Microsoft investing in the company and that they'll keep office on there.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:50.780]   The fact of the matter is, at that point in time, office matter and more to Mac users
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:56.180]   than the Mac did and so did Photoshop and Jobs never forgot that.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.140]   I mean, Jobs was right about the Flash stuff.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:02.460]   Everything that happened since then was Apple's attempt was never again.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:03.460]   They said never again.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:06.020]   Are we going to be beholden that Adobe?
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.020]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:14.420]   Or any app developer and I'm convinced and I wrote this several years ago that Apple,
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:20.020]   so much of Apple's behavior on developers is driven by this, you know, never again.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:24.540]   And you think about it, like with paper, they've done it without actually having a business
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:30.700]   model, but I care more about paper than I do with the iPad and that's why I buy an iPad.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:37.940]   And so Apple's hesitancy is like you can at least theoretically understand it, but the
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.660]   problem is they're going to spite their nose to…
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.260]   Cut off their nose, just bite their face.
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.820]   No, I think you've pinpointed a real structural issue.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.540]   Apple's built a company to do one thing and for the true success of the iPad Pro, it
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.700]   needs to do something completely antithetical to them.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.300]   But Apple has not one…
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.300]   Like one of the thing…
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.300]   Ben knows it's better.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.300]   Anybody?
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.100]   Apple is not one thing and there's these big discussions that go on inside Apple too.
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.620]   And you can look back at the original App Store and you see code.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.740]   They had accidental pop-ups that came up that showed you that upgrading and other things
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.500]   had been built into or at least tested as part of the system.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.300]   And they've tested a whole bunch of stuff over the years.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.300]   They just haven't flipped.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.300]   I don't want to say it.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.660]   It's not as easy as flipping a switch, but they haven't gone in that direction.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.660]   I like your idea.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.660]   You need a czar.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.500]   You need an App Store czar who has some power.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.500]   Well, you do because some people…
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.500]   Some people…
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.500]   Like you can see this.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.980]   There are people at Apple who believe for right or wrong that there is absolute user
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.900]   experience advantages to keeping things incredibly simple so you never have to worry about upgrading.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.300]   Never have to worry about trials.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.780]   What if you just buy the app and all you need is for is a minute and then you've taken
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.780]   all the value out of it.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.780]   Or what if you buy it and you create data in that app and then that app goes away and
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.780]   your data is still in it.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.780]   How does the person…
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.780]   Because you didn't want to decide to buy it.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.780]   It's not what happens here.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.420]   They're a little bit of questions that go around this and their answer to them so far
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.340]   has been to keep a dead, stupid, simple.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.780]   And that might not scale going forward.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.100]   They need to have someone who, again, whose job it is to fight for that discussion.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.780]   What it really comes down to, what you really realize is how docidly difficult this is and
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:06.500]   why it is so hard for a company in technology to stay relevant year in, year out.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   Brilliant companies.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.500]   Brilliant.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.500]   Microsoft has to deal with this.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.900]   Google has to deal with this.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:15.060]   But I'm so glad we've got some smart people to explain this all to me because it's starting
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.060]   to sink in.
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:21.500]   Ben Thompson from Stratecary.com, so good to have you Ed Bott from ZDNet.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.500]   Always a pleasure.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.060]   Trying to get Lucy into the shot here.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.060]   Lucy's the best.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.060]   Yeah, she's trying to…
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.060]   There she is.
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.060]   Hey Lucy.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.060]   Hey Lucy.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   There is now a new tradition on Twitter showing your dog.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.500]   Get the show you're done.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.500]   Next you have to go out in your garden, Ed, and give us a tour of your vegetables.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:48.780]   The basil has almost been completely harvested for the season.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.180]   Hi Tech, hi touch.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.900]   Also from imore.com Renee Richie, we're having a lot of fun.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.900]   This is a great show.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.900]   We'll keep talking.
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:00.220]   As long as you'll keep listening, but first a word from Braintree, are you a mobile developer?
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:05.740]   You know that if you're taking payments, payments is one of the most important things
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.940]   to do and one of the easiest things to do wrong.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:13.580]   We're not just talking about security, we're talking about your user experience.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:21.340]   70% of mobile carts are abandoned before the buy button.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.900]   That's a lot of money you're leaving on the table.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.060]   Check out what companies like Uber do.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.420]   Don't they have it down?
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.660]   Don't they make it easy to take that Uber?
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.420]   You don't even have to think about it.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.900]   You get out of the cart, you're done.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.300]   There's no button to push.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.940]   Uber uses Braintree.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.940]   Stodas lifts, Stodas Air B and B, Stodas Hotel tonight.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:41.380]   So does GitHub.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.780]   Stodas stub hub.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.140]   I love Braintree.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.340]   Braintree is making it easier and easier for mobile app developers to do one of the
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:54.500]   most important things, get paid without having to suffer through the coding of this.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:20:01.180]   Ten lines of code, they make the payment experience seamless and something like Uber,
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.460]   it feels magical.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.420]   And now you can add that experience to your app too.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.220]   By the way, take every kind of payment.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:16.100]   I mean, not just Apple Pay, but PayPal credit cards, Bitcoin, Venmo, and Braintree has great
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.100]   support.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.980]   In fact, if you don't have the time to do the integration, they can do it for you.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.700]   They've payouts are fast.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.340]   It's a secure, I mean, really secure platform.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.220]   That's important to your customers.
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.980]   They're ready to grow your company from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.940]   They've done it before they could do it for you.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:36.980]   Many a unicorn uses Braintree.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:43.580]   Braintree, a full stack payment solution waiting for you right now at braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.940]   Show the boss, show the product manager.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.180]   If you're the product manager, show your engineers.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.020]   I think you'll reach agreement very quickly.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.020]   This is the way to do it.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.900]   I just did a rental with SilverCar.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.580]   Braintree made it so easy.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.260]   It just changes your life.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.260]   It's so great.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.900]   Braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:06.980]   And by the way, if you sign up and you use that URL, braintreepayments.com/twit, we're

[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:25.620]   If you tuned in to hear about anything besides Apple today, good luck.
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.420]   Good luck.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.180]   I'm really excited by the iPad Pro, but you've now kind of depressed me.
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.620]   It sounds like this is going to be kind of an intractable problem.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:41.700]   Here you have a platform that could revolutionize computing and you have a company that has
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:46.100]   kind of a built-in business model that's antithetical to it.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.420]   Is there a solution, man?
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:22:00.100]   The thing to remember is when Apple showed iOS 8 last year, everyone was overjoyed because
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.020]   finally they're opening up, right?
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:06.500]   They're allowing more internet communication, all sorts of new capabilities, more access
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.500]   to the system.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.140]   How did that work out?
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.180]   Well, the problem is they didn't have the business model to match.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.460]   They haven't opened up the business model.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:21.260]   The good news is that one, it shows that Apple can fundamentally change their approach
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:24.820]   because they did from an API and engineering perspective.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:28.860]   Two, we've seen, at least in the history of the App Store with the in-app purchase stuff,
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:35.980]   we have seen the way that a change in policy can totally give birth to a new segment.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:41.340]   We just need to put those two things together to have these new business models for apps.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.940]   It's not just the trial, so although, if you want to do the subscription stuff, Apple's
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:50.180]   like institutional support, if you want to sell on a per-seat basis, also very poor.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:55.460]   The reality is, unless you have an internal enterprise App Store, it's actually very hard
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:23:01.940]   to sell to multiple consumers, you want to sell to a school, for example.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:07.300]   I think the point about having someone focused on this on a holistic level is a really good
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.300]   and important one.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:14.340]   There's no one on Apple's executive team that is focused on developers.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:20.180]   The App Store policy is in one of the, it's in Phil Schiller's org, which is one of the
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:28.020]   more, there's been less new blood than in some of the other orgs, particularly in engineering.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:32.860]   I think there's probably more of the old school Apple mindset of, we're going to control it,
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.180]   we're going to control everything, we're not going to be held hostage by anyone, we're
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:40.420]   going to make it super simple for consumers and that's it.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:49.780]   I wonder if there needs to be more of a change, kind of a sub-new butter process.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.500]   I think it's, I don't think it's going to be a part of forever.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.500]   Exactly.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.180]   I mean, I think we need the Craig Federighi of App Store policy.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.180]   It's really telling.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.020]   I mean, Apple was famous for its developer relations in the early days.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:05.460]   When I was, when I was, oh, as, you know, system seven and OS nine, I mean, that's where
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.180]   Guy Kawasaki made his bones.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.460]   It was developer relations were very, very important to Apple.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:14.300]   It's really telling that there's nobody at the top level of the executive team that's
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.300]   even thinking about that.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.260]   Well, the most interesting part of it is, you never all in.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:21.100]   There's so many, I mean, the App Store is doing great from a top line perspective.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.100]   The revenue numbers are huge.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.940]   There's no one going up to do that.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.220]   It would, and there's no, there's no warning signs.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.220]   They will.
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.220]   They will.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.220]   Um.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.220]   Executive.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.220]   What, right.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.140]   They are coming in, but the problem is almost all that money is from, is coming from, you
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:39.660]   know, games and also subscription services like Netflix and stuff like that.
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.420]   And, and so if you're Tim Cook and you, you have 40 gazillion things on your plates and
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:48.340]   all you see from the App Store is that it keeps going up and to the right.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.460]   Like you're, there's no, how is this going to ever break through?
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.460]   Right.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:59.260]   To me, the big, the big signifier of the App Store is iPad revenue, um, which I think there's
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.260]   just no reason to buy an iPad.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:04.140]   I think that's because there aren't the sort, enough of the compelling apps that make it
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:09.220]   a must buy, but we're getting into kind of a very convoluted chain of cause and effect.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.700]   That's, I will admit, hard to prove.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.020]   And I might be wrong about this.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:19.060]   I don't think I am obviously, but I can appreciate why this hasn't broken through to the higher
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.060]   levels of Apple.
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.060]   Hey, things.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.420]   But here, let me just.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.540]   So one of the things was, uh, Apple needs a czar for the App Store.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:34.980]   Well, no, they need a business model for the app store that expands beyond what it is.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   And riching Apple.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:41.100]   But this is, but this is, and Ben, you were there during this time period.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:48.020]   This is, uh, Microsoft's unwillingness to cannibalize its own Windows business to build
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:52.180]   the future eventually wound up costing it.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:59.540]   And this is the same dilemma that Apple finds itself in 180 degrees, the opposite direction,
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:06.940]   their unwillingness to cannibalize their highly successful consumer app store business in
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:12.620]   order to make it palatable to businesses and enterprises is, it's, it's the same exact
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.620]   thing.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:18.700]   No matter how much you talk about the willingness to be able to disrupt your own business to
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:24.860]   see the future, it's, uh, it, the, the, you may be intellectually willing to make that
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:31.660]   happen, but when you have to deal with quarterly results that, where every product line that
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:37.540]   you're selling is bringing in multiple billions of dollars, uh, or tens of billions of dollars
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.220]   per quarter, you don't cannibalize that.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.820]   And that's what you don't need a czar.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:47.940]   You need a, you need an executioner who's going to come in there and, and, and basically
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.380]   say this business has to change because in three years, uh, the, the, the spigot is going
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.380]   to stop flowing.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.620]   Steve Jobs could do it.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.780]   He did do it many times.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.540]   You don't have anybody like that anymore.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.380]   Well, but if you look at what happened to Apple recently, the reorganization, um, Craig
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.220]   Federico, he went, like he was not just that at Mac OS 10 anymore.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.580]   He went to iOS as well.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.500]   So development now more or less that there is like the watch in the car and stuff like
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.380]   that, but more or less, Craig Federico is running across or like across the product
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:17.380]   line.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.820]   Johnny I was running across the product line and there's more, Angela Aaron's is now online
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.260]   and in store retail.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.860]   They combine those two things that hasn't happened with app store.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.780]   You still have app.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.660]   I think store managers, like people whose job it is to sell stuff from the store, I think
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:31.900]   they would love a lot of the things that we're all talking about, but people who are not
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:37.020]   developer relations because developer relations and evangelism and review our separate organizations
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.460]   all under Phil Schiller, but separate there.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.660]   There are the ability to go across those orgs and make things happen.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:45.700]   I think the czar is the guy, you know, I don't know if he's an executioner, but I think
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.340]   the czar is the guy who goes in and makes all that happen.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:54.220]   The VP who does have that cross the cross company, a power to enact positive change.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.220]   Let's talk.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:59.140]   I think it does make a really interesting point though that all the app store policies are
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:04.760]   very well tuned for a widespread consumer market and they're well tuned for the iPhone,
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760]   frankly.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:12.780]   The sort of apps that succeeded on the iPhone are well supported by the current app store.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.220]   What I talked about before, the distinction between a niche business model where you're
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:20.020]   maximizing revenue per customer and a scale business model where you're maximizing the
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:21.420]   number of customers.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:27.620]   It's very hard to support both or to kind of wrap your head around both.
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:32.580]   The exact thing we're talking about is even the free to play games, that's still a scale
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:36.260]   model because the whole way they work is you get the games as many people as possible
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.820]   and you get like 1% of them to give you a ton of money.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.820]   That's really my core.
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:41.820]   You can see how your money from.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:42.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   Yes.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.820]   The iPhone is a scale play.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.700]   You got to remember the iPhone is like 60% of Apple's revenue or profits.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:55.420]   It's just a huge part of the company and that more than anything is the thing with the iPad.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:00.980]   I mean, it is a niche product and it's going to always be a niche product from Apple's
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:06.260]   perspective and all the changes we're making are primarily to benefit or proposing or primarily
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.260]   to benefit the iPad.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:16.740]   And that's a reason to be concerned and frustrated and to appreciate why it doesn't seem to
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   think it's a problem.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.580]   Like these things just seem like such low-haying fruit.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:27.340]   I love CR1 in our chatroom showing his air audition quoting Upton Sinclair.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:32.940]   It's difficult to make a man understand something when his paycheck depends on his not understanding.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.940]   Right.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:34.940]   We'll give that.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.940]   Success has problems, right?
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:40.900]   Let's talk about Apple TV.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.540]   It's changing the face of television.
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.020]   The future of television says Apple.
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.900]   It looks pretty clear that they held onto it for at least six months.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:56.820]   If not longer waiting hoping to make deals with networks to turn it into an over the
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.420]   top set top box, they weren't able to make those deals.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.620]   They finally did release it.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.620]   What is Apple?
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:07.060]   Renee, give us the lowdown on Apple TV.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:08.340]   This was a hobby for Apple.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.460]   It's still a hobby as far as I can tell.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.380]   Is this important to Apple's overall plans?
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.060]   It's important in that traditionally the Apple TV like the Apple Watch enhances the overall
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.060]   Apple ecosystem.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.500]   If you have an iPhone and an Apple Watch, an iPhone and an Apple TV, you get greater
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.660]   value than just having the iPhone by itself.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:28.340]   The Apple TV and the Apple Watch aren't really devices unto themselves yet.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.060]   Maybe the Apple TV will get there.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.620]   You're getting a really small...
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:36.580]   Apple TV was originally this really small version of OS X with a big hard drive.
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.580]   It didn't really go anywhere.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.300]   You had to sync over all your content.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:43.300]   Then with the second Apple TV, it became an iOS device that just streamed everything.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:44.660]   They've been building on that.
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.620]   Now you have a box that's based on iOS 9.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.380]   As an Apple A8 processor, it runs Metal, which is Apple's version of Open GL or DirectX.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.540]   It runs apps now.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.820]   You have an App Store.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.700]   Those apps are different binaries than they are for the phone or the iPad, but you can
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.660]   sell them on the App Store in bundles.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:00.700]   You can be playing your game.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:01.700]   You get home.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.140]   You just keep playing on your television.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:07.900]   There's going to be apps for Netflix that can do more than just what the JSON frameworks
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.260]   allowed them to do in the original Apple TVs.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.420]   They'll be able to be full on apps and offer a ton more features.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:17.300]   The natural language interface with Siri, which does a sequential inference thing, but
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.180]   they've really tuned it well for the television.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.620]   You can say, "Show me comedies.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.180]   Show me only new comedies.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.980]   Show me the episode of Twit where Ben Thompson is a guest star."
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.380]   It knows how to process all that.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   Go back.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.380]   I missed what they said.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.220]   That's my favorite feature because I'm old.
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.220]   What are they just saying?
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.220]   It goes back.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.220]   It goes back.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.780]   Then it shows you the subtitles too to make sure you love that.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.780]   It's fun.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.740]   It does all these little clever things and it has a new remote with touch on it.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.740]   Just for that.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:45.580]   What is the syntax for show Ben Thompson on Twit?
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.420]   No, I know that one.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.500]   They showed what I want to show me all James Bond movies.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.420]   Now show me James Bond movie.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:53.900]   You don't even say James Bond movies again.
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:54.900]   What did she say?
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:55.900]   What did she say?
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900]   What did he say?
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.900]   That's the syntax.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.900]   It shows you closed captioning for that 15 seconds.
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.900]   Sold.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.860]   We don't get like Gary in the universe.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.420]   I say that every night.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.420]   Lisa does too.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.420]   What?
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.420]   We rewind.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   Say it.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.420]   You missed something else.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:14.420]   It said it means horrible.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.420]   We rewind so much.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.420]   Okay, good.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:23.100]   By the way, skip ahead seven minutes, which advertisers are not going to like too much.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.420]   They're not famous for having advertising based content on it.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   Actually, you're right.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.420]   That's our iTunes.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.740]   Do you think that that was a problem with making deals with CPS and the local?
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.860]   There's so many layers.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:35.620]   For the developer side, this runs, it's a version of UI kit, the same stuff that runs
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:37.460]   on the iPhone and iOS.
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.420]   They hit a bunch of stuff to make it much simpler.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.540]   But if you know how to develop those apps, you know how to develop Apple TV apps now.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.500]   And if you have a popular app, you can bring it over.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.500]   There's a lot of advantages.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.340]   Will it be an open app story?
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:50.340]   In other words, if I develop a Twitter app, I obviously have to go through the approval
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.260]   process, but they're going to be, have they say anything about that?
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:57.060]   Are they going to be fairly democratic about that?
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.700]   I guess it depends on whether it makes sense or not for a television.
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   They only showed off entertainment, home shopping and games so far.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:09.060]   I think the apps will be relatively open, but to get into the universal search, that
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   is controlled.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.060]   Yeah, I understand that.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.300]   And I wouldn't expect that, frankly.
[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:16.020]   Although universal search is actually really clever.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:19.540]   They have this idea that a developer might make a mistake and put private data as public
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.540]   data.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.900]   So when they get it, they just hash it and then they wait till many people access it
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:28.020]   in the app to make sure one that it really is public and it's popular and then they
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.220]   start servicing that.
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:34.820]   So you get an absolutely assured public information, but the most popular version of that public
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   information as well.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.860]   I'm talking about the way you can search across shows.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.700]   So if you want to find a certain episode or so, it's showing on Hulu, it's showing
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:42.700]   whatever.
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.860]   But that does not include Amazon Prime Video.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:50.500]   Well Amazon doesn't include iTunes either, so it's fair.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.580]   If you want to put Amazon, we'll search on that.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.580]   So we have fragmentation in the extreme.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.620]   Insane fragmentation.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.860]   In television now.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:08.220]   And as far as I'm concerned, Apple TV is a lovely device and I can imagine it being
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.340]   successful in some living rooms.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.900]   It feels like an accessory to me.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:20.300]   In the same way that Apple Watch feels like an accessory, you have to be invested in one
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:27.940]   of the major high cost, high value components of the Apple ecosystem, either a MacBook or
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.660]   an iPad or maybe one of the high priced iPhones.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.740]   And then you start to see the value of the watch and the TV.
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:39.420]   Well, wait a minute, can I use Apple TV without having any other Apple device at all?
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   But it's not as valuable to the value.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.820]   Well, as long as I could say, what did he say and skip ahead seven minutes?
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.260]   No, all of that is wholly independent.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.540]   And the federated search.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.700]   So what, so this is, by the way, Fire TV had the same problem.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   It was searched.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.740]   But not everything.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   One of the really favorite Amazon is Ben, what do you know?
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.340]   Is Apple going to not allow search across some platforms?
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.380]   No, they, no, they, so you have to get into universal search.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.620]   So that's a separate one.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.740]   That makes sense because you have to have a database that they could read and that makes
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   sense.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:16.140]   Well, the big hole is they don't have Amazon Prime video and it doesn't seem.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.140]   Well, they don't have YouTube.
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.140]   Did they put YouTube?
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.260]   Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if they got Amazon Prime video and YouTube
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.660]   suits their business models, both of them.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.340]   Well, well, one of the things.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.180]   But it's a non starter until it does.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.180]   I agree with you.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.380]   Well, you think you got to, I mean, that's, that stuff is going to be a heck of a no go.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.980]   I wish I could listen to that negotiation.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.580]   Right now, almost anybody is a court cutter or just wants these kinds of capabilities,
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:38.740]   has more than one box.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.820]   They have a Roku and an Apple TV.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.620]   I have the all, I have everything.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.140]   Shields and again, Leo, I have a thing.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.020]   I have an Xbox one.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:48.020]   I like that.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.020]   I have that too.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.020]   And I love the Xbox one.
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:55.140]   And I have a, I have a Comcast cable subscription.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:36:02.300]   And between the two of those, I have more entertainment than I need of, and I'm in the
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:09.220]   demographic that will pay large amounts of money for video content and the upcoming
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:15.580]   demographic, the demo, the one that, you know, all the advertisers want here, isn't
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.300]   willing to pay hardly anything.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:21.380]   No, they watch, they watch YouTube on their iPhone.
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:30.460]   Well, they are, they are, do seem to be willing to pay for, for Netflix and, and who, I mean,
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:36.820]   that's something like 22% of, it's a pretty significant number of, of the range, which
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:39.820]   is much higher than when it's paid for watch for the categories.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:45.540]   But I think the bigger issue, which I thought you were going to say, Adam, is the usage
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:51.300]   for younger generations, they're primarily watching these services on iPhones or on iPads
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:58.180]   or on their computer, the actual usage of the, there's going to be a bifurcation between
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:04.220]   the viewing of TV content and the uses of the TV set and the, the amount of time spent
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.860]   watching TV has made, remains super consistent for ages.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.540]   It's actually, it's a huge deal that decreased by a couple of minutes over like this last
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.460]   year, which was like the first time it's, it's, it's ever decreased at all.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.660]   But even then it's still been, been very, very long.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:17.900]   It's huge screen time.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:18.900]   It's probably going up.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.300]   I mean, total screen time, right?
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:27.900]   Well, well, no, the issue though is just the, the TV set in general in the very long run,
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:30.820]   I think is only ever going to be an accessory.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.180]   It's going to be much less the center of things.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:39.420]   And I think for young people in particular, they're having their own screen is a big deal.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:47.380]   And it's, and, and you share that screen and you, and you share that screen with people.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:50.580]   You don't have a, it's not a communal experience.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.060]   It's a shared here, here, look at my screen.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.300]   Here's what's on my phone.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.300]   Look at my phone.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.900]   Here's what's on my laptop.
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:58.900]   Look at my laptop.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:04.900]   It's not, I mean, the idea of a big screen in a living room is, first of all, the idea
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:11.660]   that you have a living room is alien to a younger generation.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:17.260]   And the idea that you then have content that's coming exclusively to that big screen in the
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:20.860]   living room, and everyone sees at the same time, is also alien.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:25.820]   And it will seem very quaint, like rotary dial phones in about 10 years.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:29.140]   But I wonder if how much, because right now we've had a discontinuous experience, and
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:32.580]   I wonder, cause continuity and extensibility and all these things are playing huge into
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.020]   Apple's current plans.
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.300]   You're playing a game on your iPhone, you come home, no one else is using a TV, you're
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:38.740]   just playing it on the Apple TV.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.300]   It's a continuous experience.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.540]   We used to complain that, oh, I have Angry Birds on one device.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:44.580]   I can't even pick up my iPad and play it.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.780]   And you're going to be able to pick up on one device, play on another.
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.180]   So I think the lines are going to blur.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.220]   And to the previous point, I'm going to keep saying this Leo, Amazon Prime still isn't
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.180]   in Canada, so it doesn't matter to me if it's on the box or not.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.860]   I mean, I don't know how many channels you get.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.260]   If you only got Amazon Prime, you'd know.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.860]   I know, but I mean, the international services are there.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:07.460]   The ones that most of the, I think 100 countries or something really care about are on that
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.460]   box.
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.300]   And I'm sorry the US doesn't have all of them, but I mean, for both of those it's going
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.540]   to be a great box.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:16.180]   People knows exactly why people are going to buy an Apple TV, even at the increased price
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.260]   of $150 or $200.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.220]   Because they showed the things that sell it for me.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.940]   I just mentioned, what did he say?
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:25.300]   And skip ahead seven minutes.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.660]   Crossy road, multiplayer, sold.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.900]   The major league baseball.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:33.420]   They're selling Apple TV for old people.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:36.380]   Major, you like Major League Baseball?
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:38.300]   You like Major League Baseball?
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.500]   That was an amazing demo.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.500]   Two games going on.
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.860]   You flip back and forth.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:42.860]   No, right.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.860]   But here's the thing.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.860]   A lot of people focus on that demo.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860]   And it was an amazing demo.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:51.540]   And it shows why software, like software is better than this linear sort of stream.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:55.340]   What they didn't tell you about the demo is that you can only use the Major League Baseball
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:59.860]   app for games that are one, not a national TV and two, not in your home market.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.980]   So I'm going to be watching a lot of Toronto Blue Jays games.
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:03.980]   I'm excited.
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:08.460]   No, I mean, so you're, so you're, so basically you will, you could watch all the Yankees
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.460]   games you want.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:10.460]   And so if you're a Yankees fan, it's great.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:11.460]   No, that's a good one.
[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.460]   It's Major League Baseball.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.460]   That's them.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.060]   That's their blackout stuff.
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.460]   And that's for now.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.660]   It's not, it's them and it's every other sports league because the fact of the matter is the,
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:27.500]   the value and economics that, that come from bundling are so much greater than an over-the-top
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:32.940]   service for, for, for weeks and that, that's going to be the case for the foreseeable future.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:39.420]   And so yes, the, the, it, it's kind of a similar thing to the iPad thing.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.420]   You can have the technology in place.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:46.380]   But if you don't have the deal in this model in place, then it doesn't matter.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:52.540]   And so I think for some people, like if you're a Yankees fan living, not living in New York,
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:58.500]   like that MLB app and Apple TV looks freaking fantastic, but you're, you're, you're, you're,
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.500]   that's not everyone.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.780]   I think it is going to be more of a niche product.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.940]   And it's, and a big part of it is the business part has to come through.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:11.300]   And I think people are like people in tech have been predicting the end of cable and linear TV
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.260]   for like going on like 40 years now.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:17.580]   That's before cable even existed, which shows how in depth this sort of argument is.
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.220]   And yes, it is fracturing.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:24.500]   And the reasons fracturing is because the jobs we ask TV to do are getting narrower and
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.500]   narrower.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.180]   But that doesn't mean that tomorrow next year we're going to be watching NFL football
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:34.580]   games with our NFL app on Apple TV because the economics just aren't there until they're
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.780]   there, it's going to be a niche device.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:40.100]   We've been inside the fact that I'm not sure how much young people are even using big TVs.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:45.820]   Anyway, actually my kids will watch YouTube on the big TV, which is really strange.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.460]   But there is a communal aspect.
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:52.700]   Don't forget that these people under 25s are maybe the most communal generation ever.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.540]   They do everything they date in groups.
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:59.260]   So, but that's only a fraction of your TV usage.
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.580]   And so I'm not saying TVs are going away, but it's like people are people, people will
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.980]   still want private cars.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:09.980]   I just think in the future, they're more likely to rent them than to own them, like in which
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:11.740]   you can give the Apple car question.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:15.900]   So I think that Uber for television, none of this stuff is going to be the way that I think
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.860]   the, I'm just going to stop there.
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.740]   Uber for television, what would that be?
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.980]   I don't even, I can't even add your right though.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:30.260]   The Xbox one with that NFL app on the side there with the stats and the fantasy stuff,
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.260]   that's cool.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.260]   That's nice.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]   That's actually a world on app.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:37.860]   And it's very, and nobody knows about it.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.700]   And nobody knows about it.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:48.460]   And what we have actually in TV now is a situation where we don't have dominant, in
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:55.660]   every other platform, you have one or two dominant manufacturers, you know, in smartphones,
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:03.500]   Apple and Android, and nobody else matters, in the TV set top box space, you either get
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:12.980]   what your provider gives you or you have an incredible assortment of fractionalized,
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.380]   randomized, bosses.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:20.540]   You should, I can't, Lisa says, oh good, let's watch Ray Donovan.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.460]   I said, well, we can't watch Ray Donovan in the living room.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:29.140]   We can only watch Ray Donovan in my den because the device that recorded Ray Donovan, it's
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.300]   crazy.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.580]   I had to explain that to Judy the other day.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:37.540]   I'm sorry, we can't watch this movie on the big screen TV because it's not on a service
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:38.900]   that's on the Xbox one.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:39.900]   It's crazy.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:45.540]   I'll have to pull it up on the laptop or the tablet and mirror cast it or from cast
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.540]   to the TV.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:54.060]   And I feel sorry, we're about to go on some really fun international travels and we're
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.500]   going to have house sitters here.
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:59.620]   And I have to write a damn manual.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:05.300]   I have to actually write a manual for our house sitters on how to work the TV.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.260]   And I'm tempted to just unplug it and throw a blanket.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:12.820]   Where are they from?
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:17.180]   Oh, they're the ones from our house sitters.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:18.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:22.420]   Because I say if they come from Germany or something, you just say turn to channel three
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.580]   and you're good.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:32.940]   The issue is that the differentiation in TV is driven by the content.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.860]   It's not driven by the device.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:40.980]   And this is why the app store is potentially the most interesting part of the Apple TV
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:47.140]   is because the app store, if that becomes a differentiator, that gives Apple more control
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:50.260]   and more leverage with the content providers.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.180]   Right now the content providers are the ones that have all the leverage.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:55.900]   And it's the same thing in music I'd add as well.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:45:00.420]   Like in music, it's the labels that have all the leverage, which is why from a pricing
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:04.380]   and content perspective, the Apple music isn't differentiated.
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:06.620]   You can look at it compared to iTunes.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:10.900]   What made iTunes the juggernaut that it was was piracy.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:14.220]   And what I mean by that is the labels were so scared of piracy, they were willing to
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.700]   do a deal with Apple.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:19.340]   Today streaming kill piracy, which means the labels are in some respects stronger than
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.340]   it ever been.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.060]   So Apple gets no special favors.
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:28.900]   And if you have the same thing in video where the content provides a differentiation, that
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.180]   means there's not going to be a dominant player.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.060]   Like in a stack, in whatever industry might be.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.900]   There's one layer that matters.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.300]   And that layer and everything else, it's going to be commoditized.
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.140]   Is Chromecast the solution?
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.420]   Chromecast really is interesting.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:50.380]   As long as apps have Chromecast support built in, you can use any device to just cast it
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:52.700]   to your TV.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:53.700]   I love the Chromecast.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:56.700]   I think that's a very clever way around this.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:00.780]   No one in this sector is going to become dominant unless someone gets leverage.
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:04.700]   And nobody's going to get leverage because right.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:11.820]   And even as simple as you and I think that Chromecast is or Miracast, every Windows 10
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:19.580]   device supports Miracast and my Android phone supports Miracast as well.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:25.580]   You've got all those things in there, but ordinary people, just their eyes glaze over
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:30.300]   and they try to imagine the idea that there's something they're watching on their phone or
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.300]   a tablet or something.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:36.660]   And then they have to go through a series of, if it's more than one click to make it appear
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.180]   on the TV, it's not going to happen.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:42.260]   And it's still the barriers to entry are too high.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:48.340]   There's a reason that Google made the price of the Chromecast $35 or whatever it was because
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:58.900]   they wanted to, they wanted to seed it out there into the technically sophisticated audience.
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:04.700]   But I don't think that ordinary people are going to be able to manage this complexity.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.940]   The problem is still complexity.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:13.900]   And complexity is being driven by business models and ridiculous global copyright laws.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.820]   Well, it's also not reliable enough.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:19.340]   If it fails once or twice, they just stop trying and all of them fail on you enough that
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:21.220]   most people will never touch it again.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:25.300]   Well, the issue, the issue, the complexity people live.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:26.620]   I don't, I don't know.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:29.660]   Oh, we're better lives, Leo.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:33.300]   Everyone is focused on this complexity issue, but that is second.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:34.460]   There's two aspects of complexity.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.460]   There's UI complexity.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.980]   And everyone's like, oh, I can't wait for the cable to box to die because it's the UI
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.980]   is complex.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:43.740]   The problem is that is a second order concern.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:48.340]   The first order concern is can I find the stuff that I want complexity?
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.420]   And the cable box still wins here.
[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:54.940]   And the complexity that you guys are driving at is do I look at it at Apple TV?
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:55.940]   Do I look at it?
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.300]   I was in fire to look at it.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.820]   Like, where do I find it?
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:03.700]   That is a different sort of complexity that Apple TV has yet to solve.
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:08.260]   And the UI can be as beautiful and as intuitive and as fun to use as it could be until it
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.980]   solves that first order level of complexity.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.540]   Because what matters is the content.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.580]   That's what I mean by that being the differentia layer.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:20.420]   It's going to have trouble breaking through in competition to something that has all the
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:25.900]   content, even if it's got this convoluted remote in this ugly grid on the TV screen.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:27.980]   Is there a genetic difference between people?
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:33.180]   Because I can sit down at any television multimedia setup, see the remotes, look at what's there
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.100]   and go, okay, I can do this.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.140]   And then there's other people.
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.660]   Yeah, but we can't do what they do, Leo.
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:40.660]   It's like a vocabulary.
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:41.660]   What do they do?
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:42.660]   They're so great.
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:45.620]   They need to be better sitting or mechanical engineering or they can think of the car part,
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:48.140]   put it back to everyone has aptitudes.
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:52.140]   But I guarantee everyone in this panel and probably everyone listening doesn't need a
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:54.780]   manual to figure out how to watch TV.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:55.780]   It's obvious.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:57.740]   You just put it on HDMI one.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:58.740]   It doesn't.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:01.860]   And then you got to get the to turn on the Xbox one and the real.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.020]   They will throw that controller.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.020]   And if you.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:11.500]   But we are the one percent or even the one tenth of one percent in terms of technology.
[01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.740]   And that's a that is a real problem.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:17.700]   The problem is the conceptual layer that goes on top of this.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.460]   If I can.
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:21.820]   I spend a lot of my time as an instructor.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:22.820]   I write books.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:28.620]   I write books and manuals and articles that explain to people how to do things.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:34.100]   And the hard part is not the step one, step two, step three.
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:40.740]   The hard part is the conceptual layer where you where you explain to someone how this
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.060]   thing works.
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:49.100]   So that when the steps that I just wrote about stop working because Microsoft or Apple or
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:55.500]   Google came out with an update in two months that breaks that that step by step regime that
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.780]   I talked about.
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:00.420]   If they understand the conceptual thing that I explained, they can get through it very
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:01.940]   easily.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:04.460]   But those conceptual layers.
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   I easy.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.460]   I I.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.460]   I.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:11.260]   I got to I got to share this tweet because I think it it captures it perfectly.
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.100]   Even Sandop just tweeted me on Twitter.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:17.340]   It says people are literally willing to flip aimlessly through channels to find what they're
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.820]   looking for as long as they know it's on somewhere.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:24.780]   But that's what's so smart about that is the key is that they know it's there.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:27.980]   And if it's 500 channels, they're never going to find it.
[01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.940]   They absolutely will.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:34.420]   The challenge for an Apple TV is if you if you can't turn on the Apple TV and know that
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:38.300]   what you want to watch watches on there and you have this additional layer, I want to
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:40.860]   watch X, which thing do I use?
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:45.980]   Like the UI doesn't matter if you have this this first this this issue of you don't even
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.780]   know if what you want.
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:48.780]   This uncertainty.
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:52.900]   Uncertainty is uncertain is even worse than a bad UI.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:56.180]   I have in my I have a I just looked it up.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:01.180]   I have in my Evernote a note how to turn on the den TV because I figured I'm going to
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.860]   be sending this text out.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:07.540]   Turn on the TV with a small silver remote and choose cable set from the onkyo remote.
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:11.580]   And make sure the Xbox is turned on by pressing the Xbox button on the game controller.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:13.660]   Then choose TV on the Xbox.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.100]   Sometimes the TV turns off.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.860]   So if the screen goes dark, turn it back on with a little silver remote, then use the
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:22.420]   XFINITY remote to choose 702.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:30.860]   That was to watch one thing once my my version has PDFs with screenshots of the remote with
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:31.860]   all of buttons.
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:37.460]   And by the way, this is out of date now because the if you use a silver remote to try to
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:41.660]   turn the TV back on, it's going to turn the onkyo off because of CEC.
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:44.180]   So now let's take a break.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.900]   I mean, Ben's point like consistency is absolutely a user feature.
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.820]   If you don't know it's going to be there, you're going to you're going to doubt that
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.820]   it's be there.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:50.820]   And then it just affects your height.
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:51.820]   I think it's worse than that.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.820]   I really do.
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:55.980]   I think it's a mess, but we'll figure it out.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:01.860]   So that's why you end up watching the Sopranos instead of the wire like you wanted to.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.980]   When we come back, we're going to talk about the things Apple left out.
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:08.580]   So very big things that Apple left out of the keynote.
[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:14.140]   Renee Richie is here from iMore.com Ben Thompson for Stratecary Ed bot from ZDnet.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:18.620]   I got the three smartest people in the world here.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.780]   We are this is we're getting down to it.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.300]   You can run an Apple keynote like that Leo.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:25.940]   I feel like this stuff is like chess or something.
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.940]   I mean, it's no, it's worse.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:31.340]   It's like a Rubik's Cube mixed with 3D chess.
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:34.180]   And you make one move and then three years later, I'll crap.
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:38.180]   You screwed up the business model and the whole thing falls apart.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:41.780]   I don't know how anybody survives in this world.
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:46.020]   It's gotten too complex and that's why I'm going to move to a farm.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:50.180]   Are you buying the new iPad, the new Apple phone?
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:53.100]   Maybe you want to find somewhere to put your old one?
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:54.700]   Can I make a suggestion?
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:55.700]   Gazelle.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:56.700]   Gazelle.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:58.140]   G-A-Z-E-L-E.
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.140]   Gazelle.
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:03.140]   Gazelle makes it easy to buy and to sell.
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:05.380]   So let's talk about selling first.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:07.060]   That's how Gazelle got famous.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.700]   You can trade in your old devices.
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:15.340]   By the way, get a price that's locked in so you know what you're going to get and you
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:17.180]   have 30 days to decide.
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:19.620]   They will buy even broken iPads and iPhones.
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:24.420]   Of course, they buy other devices like Blackberries and Samsung galaxies.
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:28.580]   They'll buy Surface tablets, Google tablets.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:33.100]   If you go to Gazelle.com, you'll see what $335 from my six plus three to seven.
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.100]   $45.
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.380]   That's awesome.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.380]   Now here's the deal.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.580]   You've got 30 days to pull the trigger on that.
[01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:40.580]   You don't have to.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.580]   There's no obligation.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:46.180]   The only obligation is from you to from Gazelle to you that they'll give you that price.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.020]   Once you decide, okay, I'm going to take advantage of this.
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:50.020]   You check out.
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.820]   They send you a box prepaid postage.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.500]   You pay postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:55.500]   You pile that box.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.980]   It put a lot of stuff in there.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:57.980]   You've got old gadgets.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:59.540]   They're just gathering dust.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.540]   That's crazy.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.060]   That's like saying, oh, here's a hundred dollar bill.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:03.500]   I'm just going to leave it in the drawer.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.060]   That's crazy.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:06.180]   Send it there.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.420]   If you forget to wipe the personal information or you can't because the device is broken,
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:11.380]   they'll do that for you.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.740]   Then they turn it around and they give you your money very fast.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.900]   You get a check in the mail.
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:17.660]   You can get a direct deposit in your PayPal account.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.060]   That's really fast.
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:22.700]   Or for an extra five percent, use the Amazon gift card.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.060]   If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, that's a great deal.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:29.900]   Gazelle's paid out well over $200 million to over a million customers.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:35.180]   Now they buy and sell.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:38.300]   The best stuff that comes into Gazelle will be sell.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:40.180]   You can buy certified pre-owned.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:41.820]   When I say certified, I mean it.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:46.300]   They have this very elaborate 30-point quality inspection on every device they sell.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:50.740]   Make sure everything not only functions totally perfectly exactly right, but that the screen
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.140]   doesn't have scratches on it.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:54.380]   There's no defects, things like that.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.740]   You can get their various quality.
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.220]   You can get it at like new.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.220]   That's going to cost a little more.
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:54:59.580]   You want to save a little more.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.420]   This is what I do for my kids when they lose their phone.
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:04.780]   I get the slightly used.
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:07.980]   It's kind of, you know, slight signs of wear, but again, 100 percent functional.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.060]   30-day return means you're guaranteed that it's going to work.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:14.660]   You have 30 days to return it.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.660]   No risk to you.
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.460]   I just really love Gazelle.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.940]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E to buy to sell.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:21.940]   Remember Gazelle.com.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:29.700]   This is a good time to buy last year's iPhone on Gazelle and get a great deal.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:31.700]   Save a lot of money if you're worried about that.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.700]   All right, we're going to get back to the conversation.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:39.340]   Lots more to talk about with our great panel, but first, if you missed this week on Twitch,
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.340]   you missed a lot.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.340]   Take a look.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.340]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:43.340]   Hey there, Mike.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:49.540]   I can tell you I'm here at the Ed Sullivan Theater and the anticipation for the new iPhones
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:52.300]   and the new Apple TV is just monumental.
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:56.780]   I'm not recognizing most members of the press here as it means that if Tim Cook has more
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.780]   time for me.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:55:59.780]   Tech News Today.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:04.020]   iOS 9 will become available next week, but a new feature has shown up in the beta.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.820]   You can train Siri to respond to your voice and nobody else's.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:11.580]   Siri's version of this feature will prevent something that actually happened today in
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.220]   a White House press briefing.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:22.580]   Is the president upset that he couldn't get even one Republican perhaps to sign?
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.900]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:27.580]   So Christina, I have my purse right here and I carry my iPad in it.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:30.340]   Am I going to be able to do that with a 12-inch iPad Pro?
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:33.460]   If you can fit the new MacBook in your purse, then you might be okay.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.460]   But for real, as to be speaking, probably not.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.460]   Before you buy.
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.660]   The Moto X really appeals to me for a couple of reasons.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:45.260]   One is it's a very pure version of Android.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:46.620]   They add stuff that's really useful.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:51.020]   You'll be able to put the phone to your ear and speak to Google now and it will respond
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.420]   only through the speaker.
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:53.420]   Tweet.
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:55.060]   Great Tech News and Analysis.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.340]   Every day.
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:01.340]   Coming up this week, Dreamforce, which is Salesforce's big annual event, kicks off on
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:04.500]   Tuesday, September 15th in San Francisco.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:10.340]   Apple's iOS 9 and WatchOS 2 will become available to the public on Wednesday, September 16th,
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:15.420]   and the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon begins on Saturday, September 19th in San Francisco.
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:18.740]   For all this and the rest of the news this week, tune into Tech News today at 10 AM Pacific
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:22.820]   1700 UTC at twit.tv/live.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:24.460]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:25.460]   We're talking high tech.
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.060]   We're really talking Apple today.
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.060]   There's a lot of Apple information from the week.
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:31.300]   There's been other news too.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.900]   We'll get, I mean, Twitter.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:40.740]   I'll just say the words Google, Facebook, they're all involved.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:43.100]   You maybe can clarify for me, Renee.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:44.100]   I'm very confused.
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:49.060]   Somebody in the chat room is saying, "Oh, you can't store apps on the Apple TV.
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:51.060]   They use on-demand resources."
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:54.180]   So, Renee Caldwell wrote a good article explaining this.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:56.860]   Are Apple TV apps limited to 200 megabytes?
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:57.860]   That doesn't sound like much.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:01.760]   No, so what happens is they don't have giant hard drives in them, so they have limited
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:02.760]   NAND flash storage.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.240]   So, what happens is you have a 200 megabyte initial download.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.000]   That could be something as simple as a splash means, whatever they want.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.480]   It's designed so that if the device is full, it doesn't give you this big error message
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.160]   that says, "Sorry, you're out of room.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.400]   Please go delete something," because they don't want you to have to do file system
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.640]   management on the Apple TV.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.880]   So, what it will do is download that 200 megabytes, which will almost always fit in
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:26.720]   and then download a payload of up to 2 gigabytes immediately if there's no storage pressure.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.120]   Otherwise, it'll start removing resources from other apps as it downloads that sort of intelligently
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.720]   balance what's on the device.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.280]   So, I might want to play a game like Crossy Road and I have to wait till it downloads
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280]   because it's-
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.800]   Well, you have to wait till it downloads anyway.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.800]   So, what this does is-
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.800]   But this once.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.440]   Well, this is the same thing.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:46.720]   So, in your example, if you downloaded like Infinity Gauntlet or something and you didn't
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.840]   play it in three months and then you downloaded Crossy Roads, it would start removing the
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.120]   oldest played levels from the Infinity Gauntlet game.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.320]   The ones you'd already passed and haven't played in a long time to make room for the
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.240]   very first Crossy Roads levels.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:01.240]   And then as you played more, it'll download more and more levels and get rid of older
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240]   ones.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:05.360]   So, it's trying to intelligently balance all the space, sort of like iCloud, Photo Library,
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.040]   or iCloud Music where it wants to keep everything near lines.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.000]   You have a much bigger capacity.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000]   It's Ed's CloudPoint again.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000]   You have a much bigger capacity than you have on the lower device on the local device.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.480]   So, they sell two versions.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.320]   They sell one for $150 that has what?
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.320]   16 gigs.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   I think it's $3,264.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.320]   $3,264.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.320]   $3,264.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.320]   And then $200 for-
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.600]   Does it even matter then?
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:25.920]   Should I just get the little one?
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:29.680]   You'll just be able to keep much more local content available.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.560]   So, it'll have to do less of the load balancing.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:33.560]   All right.
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:38.520]   Well, I remember all the hell Microsoft went through with Xbox, the original Xbox One
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:42.120]   announcement about always on and checking the home office.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:43.120]   And it's funny.
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:44.320]   No Apple just, you know, nobody cares.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.080]   Well, they're not doing anything other than, so when you make an app, you just, the developer
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.360]   tags, like this is the initial download.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:51.760]   These are the levels.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.160]   It might be like video tutorials.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:56.600]   Once you've watched the onboarding thing, you don't need to store that 4 gigabyte video
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.360]   anymore or cutscene anymore.
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.360]   So it just dumps them.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.240]   And then if you ever decide, yes, I really want to watch that again.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.680]   It'll go download it for you.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.720]   One thing they didn't mention, which kind of shocked me, is HomeKit.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:11.200]   I thought the new Apple TV was all about HomeKit.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.200]   The home automation.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:13.920]   They moved that to iCloud.
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.000]   Initially, the Apple TV was a remote access point.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.640]   So if you were at the airport, wanted to switch off your lights, you could do that.
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:19.920]   Now that happens to iCloud.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.640]   So it doesn't have to do anything on the Apple TV anymore.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:24.960]   Oh, so that's that.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:30.400]   Yeah, some people have got older home automation equipment and they were hoping that Apple
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:34.520]   would do something where the Apple TV would magically make all the old things like our
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:39.920]   Hugh Lightbulbs Leo work with HomeKit without having to go buy a new Hugh Hub.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:41.480]   But then it still wouldn't be secure.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:45.800]   And then Hugh hasn't made the lights work with anybody's hub by themselves.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.360]   So that's sort of a fantasy at this point.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.480]   Google seems to have the same fantasy.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:57.240]   The on hub router really seems to be less of a router and more of a home automation hub.
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.240]   It will, but it's still, for example, unless Hugh enables their lights to work with it,
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.240]   it's not going to work with it.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.040]   So there's a lot that has to happen on both the vendor's side and on the platform owner's
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.840]   side for that to work.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.480]   You have to essentially make every light bulb its own tiny hub instead of just having that
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.320]   one Hugh Hub that connects all the lights.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.320]   I'm increasingly of the opinion that nobody's ever going to get home automation working.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.320]   And it's just a-
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   Look at there.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.320]   Really?
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]   Optimously, oh.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:27.040]   You and I, we're doing stupid things like Hugh Leitz and my doorbell with a camera on it,
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.640]   but nothing talks to anything.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.880]   Leo, you're in the trigger going to live in this one.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.640]   No, they're not.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.200]   They're not going to be able to watch TV.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.200]   They're not going to be able to do anything.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.360]   You're in the trough of depression, which is like the adoption curve, which is there's
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.520]   a ton of hype at the beginning and it goes up.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:47.240]   And then it way overshoots the capability.
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.320]   And then it was like, this sucks is never going to happen.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.320]   It's never going to come through.
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.240]   That's where the technology just keeps increasing, keeps increasing.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:57.880]   And then eventually the expectations match up with what's actually there and you realize,
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.800]   you know, what's the, what's the great Bill Gates quote?
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.400]   Like, you will always overestimate what can be done in a year and drastically underestimate
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:05.440]   what can be done in 10.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.520]   And that applies to a great many things I would imagine this is, this is one of them.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:12.640]   And there's the other thing Leo, is there's no 4K story.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.600]   And yes, 4K is not a, not many people own 4K sets yet.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.480]   There's not a lot of 4K content yet, but the Apple TV does not, the new Apple TV does
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:20.480]   not support 4K.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.520]   And while there was some speculation that maybe the hardware could, they just just turn
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.640]   on on with the software switch.
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.640]   The problem is HDMI 1.4.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.040]   It's going to really be a good solution for 4K.
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:35.160]   It could do it, but only at 30 frames.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.560]   This is not a 4K device.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.440]   Do not delude yourself.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.920]   And again, like there's a lot bigger problems.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.800]   It's all like, if there becomes an iTunes 4K, how are they going to handle upgrading your
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.800]   content?
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.400]   Like remember when it went to HD, they offered you the ability to pay to upgrade all that
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:47.400]   stuff and.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.440]   Yeah, but I could shoot 4K on my iPhone.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440]   My new iPhone.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:56.440]   Yeah, but then it gives you awesome digital zoom and the ability to crop down to do sample
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.280]   down to awesome 1080p.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.280]   Right.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:06.480]   And you have just made my point that the Apple TV is an accessory for people who already
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:13.360]   are invested in the Apple ecosystem and are willing to upgrade it in a year or two or
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.360]   three of.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:18.280]   And are perfectly happy.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.640]   If someone's coming into this for the first time, they're going to focus on the limitations.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.520]   If they're coming into this as a member of the Apple ecosystem already, they're going
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.400]   to focus on the synergies.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.400]   Synergies are for sheep.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.360]   I had to buy an iPhone TV just to get just to get GPS Leo.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:40.600]   Hey, by the way, okay, so I bought the iPhone 6s plus.
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.200]   I said I would 128 gigs because I wanted to spend more money.
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.200]   Yeah, I did.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.840]   And I'm worried now because I think it's a pink.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.840]   It is pink.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.840]   But it's an awesome metallic pink.
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.040]   Is it you and I will match?
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.040]   It is.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.040]   It is.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.040]   It's pink.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.040]   Really, really pink.
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.040]   It matches my face.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.240]   It's pink.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:01.240]   It's the new color.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.480]   Everyone will know you have the new iPhone.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.480]   You get to put it.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.480]   You get to put a case on it.
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:07.480]   Everybody puts a case on it.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.000]   I'm going to put a case right away.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.400]   Maybe I'll have a little pink.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.480]   Pinking app, but they'll be a little there'll be a little tiny pink frame around the outside
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.480]   of it.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:16.480]   It's no.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.360]   They just call it pink.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:19.360]   Pink phone.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.120]   Because rose gold sounds more inspirational.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:25.800]   See, I know rose gold is it because it's a copy colored gold.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.520]   I've seen actual rose gold.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.280]   It's not that color.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.120]   Rose gold is a copy.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.120]   This is pink.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.560]   Well, the gold iPhone is more champagne than it is actually yellow gold too.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.360]   It's goldish, goldy, like chocolatey in a popsicle.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.440]   Lea, this is this is a geek couple.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:45.440]   We're in bed.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:46.440]   We're in bed.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.440]   She's got her Mac book.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440]   She's on Verizon.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.440]   Oh, that's a mistake.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.440]   No, I was smart.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:53.440]   I used my app store, right?
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:55.440]   She's done.
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:05.440]   She beat me, by the way, because the Apple Store opened later, like 1205 or something.
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.440]   Oh, she bought the Verizon.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.440]   She went Verizon right away.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.840]   She's got it.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.840]   She said, what'd you get?
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:11.840]   I said rose gold.
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:12.840]   She said, oh crap.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:13.840]   I didn't think you were going to get rose gold.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.840]   I got rose gold.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.040]   Rose gold, buddy's now Leo, all of us.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:18.040]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:19.040]   Are you rose gold?
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:20.040]   This is like winning.
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.040]   How about silver?
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:28.600]   This is like the people who think they're winning because they were the last bitter standing
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:30.000]   in an eBay option.
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000]   I win.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.720]   First, first.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.240]   First.
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:37.440]   I know actually I was because you know the only people doing this are us.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.840]   I'm watching Renee on Twitter.
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:39.840]   He's watching me on Twitter.
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:40.840]   What'd you get?
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:41.840]   What'd you get?
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:42.840]   Did you get in?
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:43.840]   What's the best place to go?
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:48.360]   Get to the app store on the web or do you go to the app store on the iPad or the iPhone?
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.360]   How did you do it?
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.360]   Silly.
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.360]   You got a much better shipping date.
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:52.760]   I'm getting mine on the cover.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:53.760]   What?
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:55.760]   Did you get up?
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.440]   I got it like a 12 or three or something.
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.320]   I figure I'm playing some sort of Canada tax.
[02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:00.320]   There's your mistake.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.960]   You're right up at 12 o'clock.
[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:05.000]   Refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.600]   Yeah, I won't get it.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:11.040]   I won't even though I got the first day shipping date, but I have to have it shipped to me
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:12.040]   then right in Taiwan.
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:13.800]   That's kind of funny because they're going to ship it from China.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.440]   China to the United States and then back to you in Taiwan.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:20.480]   Yeah, it's annoying because it's going on first day in Hong Kong in China, but in Taiwan
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:24.680]   is supposedly a part of the Apple's greater China region, but we don't get it first day.
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:25.680]   Would it be?
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:26.680]   Go ahead.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:34.320]   See, I want the one that comes with iOS 9.2 because those other ones seem-
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.320]   The middle finger emoji.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.320]   Kind of.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:37.320]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.320]   Don't we get the middle finger emoji right off the bat?
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:40.320]   iOS 9.1.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:41.320]   No, that's iOS 9.1.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.320]   Just in the beta.
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:45.080]   The burritos and the tacos and the pizza.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.080]   The hot dog.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:50.280]   You get the middle finger emoji just for buying it in the first hour, Leo.
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:51.960]   I get the privilege of spending $1,050.
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:57.280]   I win for pink.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:59.280]   That's only a 20 bucks a month, Leo.
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:04.040]   It's so interesting to watch because, for instance, you would strongly get the impression
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:07.920]   that Apple invented the middle finger emoji.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:12.240]   But in fact, all they're doing is now supporting the full Unicode emoji step.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:14.960]   That's a big deal because they didn't before and some people were saying Apple would never
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:15.960]   do it.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.720]   And there was all our nerd-friendly over blogging about it saying, "I don't care about any other
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:19.720]   feature in iOS 9.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:23.120]   I just want the reverse hand with middle finger because then the emoji or the taco or the
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:24.120]   American food."
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:25.120]   American food.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.120]   It's still no put in.
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:27.200]   I'm just going to say that's still no put in.
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:28.200]   I'm very distraught.
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:29.640]   No, American food.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.640]   Forget the put in.
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.960]   Nobody wants put in.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.240]   How would you even make put in an emoji?
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:36.920]   All you do is you hold down on the French fry and it gives you the tater tots.
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:39.200]   The put in and chips is an option.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.640]   I want garlic fries in there because I'm from San Francisco.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.640]   I mean, it's all a million of them.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640]   You're right.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:48.640]   That's actually brilliant.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:50.120]   And actually, emojis are passe.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.600]   It's all about stickers now, right?
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.600]   Emojis are too little.
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.600]   They're the little baby things.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:54.600]   I want giant stickers.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:56.360]   Hey, stickers are awesome.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:57.360]   I agree.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.760]   We need stickers and I'm not sure.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.880]   Which messaging app do you use line?
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:04.720]   Well, the problem is the problem is the killer feature of any messaging app is who else is
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:06.600]   on it, right?
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:09.080]   Which means, yeah, I use a ton of them.
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:10.080]   But it varies by country.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:13.840]   I mean, I use line for everyone in Taiwan.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:21.160]   But then I mostly use iMessage with Google Voice's horror and this client for text messaging
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.360]   as a fallback for anyone who does that on iPhone, for people in the States.
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.000]   Good God.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.960]   It's sad.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:29.960]   It's sad.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:37.240]   I use telegram because it's got the best set of giant emojis of all kinds.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.240]   You sent me Donald Trump.
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:38.760]   It was awesome.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.640]   I sent you Donald Trump.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.160]   I've got Trump.
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.560]   I've got Taylor Swift emojis.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.000]   I've got Star.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.640]   I mean, where else are you going to get a Star Trek emoji like?
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.480]   Wars is the word you're looking for.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.480]   Star Wars.
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.480]   I know I do it just to try.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:56.040]   Do you have Eddie Q in his red shirt?
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:57.040]   Sticker?
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.040]   No, is there an Eddie Q emoji?
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.040]   I don't know.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.040]   There should be.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.040]   Someone's got to make that.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:02.040]   Damn.
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:03.040]   With a little fold of that cuffs.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:08.720]   Someone needs an Eddie Q and Scott Guthrie emoji both in their red shirts side by side.
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.800]   They only one makes it to the planet alive.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:19.200]   And who's got the hair guy at Microsoft?
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:20.200]   Joe Belfuri.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.080]   Joe Belfuri has a beautiful, beautiful head of hair for a man.
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:27.720]   Leo.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:31.160]   I think we've got something here.
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:35.800]   A set of stickers of great hair guys.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.440]   Shinky.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:38.920]   Joe Belfuri.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:39.920]   Craig Federighi.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.920]   Craig Federighi.
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.880]   Air Force One sticker right there.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:44.880]   Love it.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:45.880]   Wow.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.800]   I have my own mechanical Leo bot on Telegram, by the way.
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.800]   If you are a telegram user.
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:53.800]   My work is done here.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.040]   At Chief Twitbot.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:58.720]   Just follow @chieftwitbot and I.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.360]   It's an automatic little bot on Telegram because I have no friends.
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:08.200]   I'm filing trademark infringement lawsuits against left and right.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.120]   He's calling Disney right now.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:11.120]   Oh man.
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:12.120]   Oh yeah.
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:13.120]   You should see these stickers.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:14.120]   Follow me on Telegram.
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:15.120]   I'll send you a set.
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.280]   You said that you have Taylor Swift out loud Leo.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:18.280]   I'm so sorry.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.680]   But Taylor Swift is perfect for certain.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.800]   See stickers are all about communication.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.760]   And there are times when you need a Taylor Swift emotion.
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:32.040]   You know, to really put the idea across.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:34.600]   I think a low Jesus really line that.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.840]   This is why line is so.
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:38.880]   I mean, part of the thing is because it's Japanese background.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.640]   The Japanese have always been very good at this sort of.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.640]   They understand this.
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:43.840]   Yeah, the character and building like.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.400]   It's in their language.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:46.840]   They're like their idea grams.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:49.520]   They understand how pictures worth a thousand words.
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:50.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:51.680]   Don't get me started on.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.360]   I wet the misconceptions of Chinese characters.
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:00.040]   But there's actual characters that are consistent.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.480]   And the level of emotion that can be exhibited in detail in context is really incredible.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.840]   And I agree.
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:09.480]   People laugh and joke about them.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:13.560]   But I think once you once you use these them, it's awesome.
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:16.920]   I just sent you a well known sticker advocate.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:17.920]   Yes.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.920]   Look at I Renee.
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:24.720]   I just sent you the perfect Taylor Swift emoji of shock and surprise.
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:27.440]   There's nothing they can open letter Leo.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:28.480]   We're both in a lot of trouble.
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:33.400]   You know what's great about this is when you what you do is you pick an emoji and then
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.760]   it shows you the stickers you have that show that emoji.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.960]   Of course, is that Leo.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:41.960]   Well, showing.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.160]   I don't even want to know what the what the one right.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:46.160]   The pet.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.160]   Oh, bear.
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:49.760]   Hey, you got to work hard to get that.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:52.880]   And then above that is a big bang theory.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.880]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:54.400]   Yeah.
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.600]   This is this is this is frightening me.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:58.160]   Oh, man, come on, Ed.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.680]   Follow me on Telegram.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.280]   I'll send you a send you a sticker.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:05.320]   You'll get the other good thing about Telegram is you if you don't have that sticker, you
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.120]   just click on it and you can add it.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:08.120]   Yeah.
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.400]   So they they they're viral.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.400]   They propagate like disease.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.120]   And they just want people using their stickers because one day they'll figure out how to
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:15.120]   charge for them.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.280]   No, no, you know when it's an open platform.
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:20.160]   You could there these are just.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:22.080]   I couldn't resist the Bill Gates China.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:23.080]   I know.
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:29.960]   Look at the by the way, the iPad pro is going to be the best fallout shelter platform ever.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.960]   The games are terrific.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.960]   I tried a bunch of them.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:33.480]   They were really, really nice.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:34.480]   Can't wait.
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:38.000]   Well, I was excited about getting the first iPad because if for words with friends was
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.240]   so hard to do on a little four inch iPhone, three and a half inch iPhone.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.400]   Those tiles are huge.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:44.400]   Now, they're big.
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:46.400]   Rich experience.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:49.000]   So we don't need your reading glasses.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000]   Yeah.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000]   We're definitely getting the, in what respect is Apple's new products?
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.600]   The total old men angle on this.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:58.200]   Oh, I'm an old man.
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:01.040]   Let me get my actually see.
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:04.640]   I actually wrote a lot of words like an actually here.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:07.400]   Rick Perry gave me these glasses.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.400]   Hello there.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:10.400]   Ed.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.120]   How are you feeling about the new living images that will be part of your iPhone?
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.960]   Harry Potter like animated images.
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:17.960]   Wow.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.960]   You know, it's like nobody ever did.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.400]   I think Nokia did it before anybody did.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.400]   1812.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.840]   Okay, they did it in 1812.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:26.840]   1812.
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.640]   The HTC Zoe's are similar to these.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:34.720]   The idea is what that the camera, as soon as you pointed at something for a second or
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:36.240]   two, it's just recording already.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:40.800]   Then you take the picture and then it records another 1.5 seconds and then what?
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:41.800]   Well, it's not recording.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:43.840]   So it's taking still images and then animating them.
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:47.520]   They were really careful to say is not video is actual still images and it kind of doesn't
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.520]   look like video.
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.680]   It looks like still images being played as fast as possible.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:52.120]   It's an animated GIF.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.120]   Yeah, basically.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:54.840]   Although I think it's in their core UI format.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:55.840]   I don't think it's.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.280]   I'm sure it's also it's pronounced GIF.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:01.280]   Never mind.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.760]   The G is silent.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.760]   It's GIF.
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:05.760]   It's a throw it.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.760]   Throw it.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:07.760]   It's throw it.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:08.760]   Warbler mangrove.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:10.760]   It's a handful of people who will get.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.760]   I think they're J.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.520]   I think they're people just left out.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:20.200]   Don't Warbler mangrove.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:23.440]   I got it because I'm an old man.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:24.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:25.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:26.440]   It is compatible with Facebook.
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:27.440]   Can I post my Harry Potter?
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:30.280]   You can send it to older iPhones and you can do a long press because there's no force
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:31.280]   press on the older iPhones.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.960]   You have a long press and it'll animate.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.120]   But I so far have only seen it on Apple's platforms.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.760]   The watch stuff did animate other platforms also.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:38.760]   Maybe they will.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.120]   We didn't talk about that, but the 3D, we haven't talked about the iPhone at all, which
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.120]   is interesting.
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:43.120]   Yes, isn't it?
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:46.920]   The 3D touch though is really good.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.120]   It's super easy to use.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.360]   I did want to ask you about that because I have to say I was very skeptical.
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:54.200]   Force touch on the watch is not intuitive and kind of.
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:55.600]   I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.240]   It's even worse on the laptops because it's not consistent and you can't really tell.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:04.880]   But everybody who tried it on the phone said this 3D touch actually works.
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.880]   Yeah.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:08.600]   Well, I think part of it is on the laptop you don't have the immediate feed.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.000]   You don't have the direct feedback to your feeder.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.560]   You need the haptic feedback.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:15.040]   The haptic, it's that you're not touching the item.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:21.640]   Like the abstraction of the touchpad makes it much more difficult to pull off.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:25.320]   I think the thing that's most impressive though, compared to the watch in particular, is that
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.960]   it always works on the phone.
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.160]   It works every time.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:33.840]   And what I think Apple is doing that smart about it, I think Apple's always been good
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:34.840]   about this.
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:41.400]   It's something that in contrast to same Microsoft, for example, is that they're keeping all of
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.400]   the...
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.960]   At least for now and they hope they can do doing that.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:49.400]   All the 3D touch interactions are just ways to do actions faster that you could do in
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:50.640]   traditional ways.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.640]   And so because the issue is it's kind of a hidden feature.
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:55.600]   Are you going to know, is it intuitive?
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.400]   Are you going to know what it's going to do and kind of get it?
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.400]   There's a stage called...
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:04.680]   It seems pretty consistent, especially when it comes to like peaking and stuff like that.
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.720]   But the point of the matter is if you don't know how to do it, it won't change the way
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:08.960]   you use the phone at all.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:09.960]   Right.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.720]   If you don't know how to do it, it makes certain aspects.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:14.160]   It speeds things up.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.120]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:20.440]   And I think I was relatively skeptical as well, but I was probably more...
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:23.400]   I was very, very impressed in actually using it in hand.
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:24.400]   Yeah.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.120]   This is back to that conceptual point of view.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.400]   Once you learn how it works, you can extend it to other things.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.920]   You learn it in one place.
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:34.240]   It works in other places.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:41.440]   What has been historically Apple's strength in terms of user interface design, they may
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:48.480]   not be first, they may not be best, but they are certainly most consistent.
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:51.000]   Well I'm liking it too to give Microsoft credit.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:51.960]   Right click.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:53.800]   Right click.
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:59.040]   The contextual menu that popped up with right click was very quickly adopted by people.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.800]   People got it right away and it was very much of a power tool.
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:04.760]   You couldn't do it on Mac because there was only one button.
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:06.480]   Well Microsoft got wrong about right click.
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:09.960]   Was there were things that you had to use right click for?
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:10.960]   Yes.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.960]   And that was actually very difficult for all, especially novice users.
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:19.560]   Because actually I think the Mac did right click better was because it was always optional.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:23.160]   In part it was forced because there was never two buttons on the laptops and stuff.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:28.000]   But that meant that anything you put right click, it also had to be visible elsewhere
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   in the UI.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.280]   So each you didn't know how to do right click you could still access it.
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:34.680]   And I think this is a really critical point in UI.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:39.960]   I think that the watch is a problem for the watch is when critical aspects of the UI are
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:43.960]   hidden, it's a big problem.
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.120]   And that's the case for the watch.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.960]   And it was the same problem for Windows 8.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:49.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.760]   Not intuitive user interface.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.200]   Well it was a huge problem.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:18:01.960]   So one thing that was kind of shocking to us when it first launched was for Windows 8
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.360]   app you needed to swipe down on the top or bottom screen.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.880]   That actually bringing the controls.
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:10.640]   It was kind of frightening the number of people that launched when it was at app and never
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:11.920]   once left the top or bottom.
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:13.920]   Like there was just no.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.280]   What's the charm spar?
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:16.280]   No affordance.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:17.280]   Where's the charm spar?
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:18.280]   Yes, exactly.
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:19.280]   Well good.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:27.200]   So really the word intuitive just it's a hot button.
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:28.360]   Well we've learned.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.520]   We thought the remote control was intuitive in our home theater.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.000]   Right now there's this intuitive.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.640]   There is can you learn it quickly?
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:46.360]   Can you if you can learn the concept quickly and extend the concept to other things that
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:48.360]   was the same thing with right click.
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:51.360]   Right click wasn't mandatory ever.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:59.360]   It was a way to quickly get to features that you otherwise had to go find menus for.
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:00.360]   Interesting.
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:01.360]   Interesting.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.560]   That was the benefit of it.
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:07.240]   The interesting thing here is that they've been working on this for years and they've
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.720]   been doing a lot of hardware work a lot of interface work and the idea is you have a single
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.160]   column view on the iPhone which is very different than on a computer with multi windows or an
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:17.200]   iPad even with a split view and it just wasn't fast.
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.840]   Click that email or the next green wrong email go back or now the phones are bigger and we
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.520]   talked about this a long time ago.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.720]   You can solve for one handed ease of use in other ways and just having a small screen.
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:31.000]   And this is sort of the confluence of this where they've done a lot of work on making
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.720]   sure that the clicks and you can adjust the click the 3D touch in settings.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:38.880]   You can turn it off if you have for example physical impediments to using it.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.440]   But if you don't they've done a very good job of making it so you press a little bit
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.440]   and you get a hint.
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:46.920]   It's almost like the head shaking animation that tells you what if there is something
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:50.480]   there and if there's not that sort of motion will open things in other apps.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.480]   So you start to discover it a little bit then you push a little bit and it gives you the
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.120]   preview which is called peak.
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:58.040]   You press a little bit more and it commits to bring it full screen which is called the
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:03.200]   pop and it has a lot like you can force swipe to go right to the multitasking interface.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:07.240]   So there's a back button now an iOS 9 for inside an app and there's the force swipe
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:09.280]   to go back through the app stack.
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:14.520]   You can force you can 3D touch the keyboard to switch it to the trackpad like on the iPad
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:16.080]   on iOS 9.
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:21.080]   There's a whole bunch of things that they just made super super fast by virtue of implementing
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:22.080]   this thing.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:26.640]   What makes me so what I find so cool about this is back in iOS 8 I said extensibility
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:29.440]   was going to be one of the biggest breakthroughs Apple has ever done.
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:33.880]   And I think I undersold it because so many of the new technologies from content blockers
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:38.880]   to video game recording to all these views that are being they've basically totally unbundled
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:39.880]   apps.
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:44.000]   Apps are not these discrete binaries that you arduously go and search for and find and
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000]   launch.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.200]   You have these little bits of functionality that you pull down or press into or swipe
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:54.080]   up and little bits of apps are everywhere and it makes the entire interface almost like
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:57.360]   it's accelerated makes it so much faster to use.
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.480]   I think I'm on a buy in a new iPhone.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:07.440]   Till it you had me a back button actually it's funny because iOS users mocked Android mercilessly
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:12.560]   for the back button it was one of the features it made me move to a and this is subtly different
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:16.120]   that the Android back button always had two purposes inside the app and outside the app
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:20.040]   and Apple's got two discrete discrete actions one for inside and one for outside.
[02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:22.000]   Good maybe they maybe they've improved on it.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.520]   I'm looking forward to it two weeks we get it and let's take a break we'll wrap things
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:32.440]   up great panel great panel so glad to have Renee Richie from imore.com and Thompson

[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:14.080]   else any of you want to say about the apple of ed there's quite a lot there was a two
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:21.080]   and a half hour event almost as long as the show and they I think in many ways kind of
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.600]   put a stake in the ground for some very interesting new stuff anything you want to say about
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:27.600]   that.
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.320]   We're are we good at we've I think we've really we've been we've been we've been we've been
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:37.400]   we're going longer than we did we did you used something earlier though that you thought
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:43.240]   was the most revolutionary thing that you thought we were going to like guess the iPad
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:48.640]   pro I I had a pro that's what I meant I really feel that the iPad pro is a breakthrough and
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.640]   I know a lot of people think I'm nuts.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.040]   No speakers are we didn't talk about that little speakers are amazing for speakers.
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:58.760]   Yeah and the audit they go as fast as a reorientation of the app so you're looking at something you
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:03.040]   turn it sideways those speakers take over everything balances why why would you put four
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:08.120]   speakers in and not put a better camera and I don't understand what they're doing.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:11.360]   So I mean I think that the idea of someone standing there with this camera to them is
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.640]   not as it's not as realistic as one watching like a vendor's age of all real people here's
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:18.880]   the iPad for a camera I see it all the time.
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:22.880]   Me too but I think those people they think are like the those people if they're using
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.920]   iPad for the camera the megapixel count of the camera is not the most important thing
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.920]   to them.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:32.280]   Although I gotta say please do not use an iPad pro to take pictures.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.440]   I wanted to shoot for a failure.
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:36.960]   You know what kind of a viewfinder that would be that would be the best you'll find a
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:42.360]   I just want you know from from when Renee just said those people I want that clip from
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:45.880]   Tropic Thunder.
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:46.880]   You people?
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:47.880]   You people.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.880]   You people.
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:53.080]   I'm one of them I use my we use the iPad to shoot everything in CES this year.
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:58.240]   Real quickly cyber attack exposes 10 million records at U.S. health U.S. health insurer
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:02.480]   excelis ablush I think they're blue they're blue something.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.920]   We've blue shield we've heard this so many times is there a story here.
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:07.920]   Nope we're screwed.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:08.920]   He's hard.
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:09.920]   He's hard.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:10.920]   We're screwed.
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:11.920]   Y'all.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:18.080]   Chris Saka says everybody I talk to all the biggest Twitter investors want Jack Dorsey
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:21.720]   to be CEO Jack's already said I'm too busy.
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.440]   They continue I don't buy that I think that the Vanity Fair article that the where that
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.800]   says he that he turned it down I don't buy that I suspect what it was was the board offered
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.560]   it to him conditional on him stepping down from square and he turned that down.
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:38.640]   Because he that's his company wants to keep doing it.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:41.280]   Yeah I suspect he's holding out to do both.
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:47.520]   By the way that article also said that the board calls Chris Saka the Unibomber.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.520]   Because he.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:53.400]   Well I mean they need it I mean the.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:57.120]   As I noted on as I noted on Twitter up here point earlier I mean the surprising thing would
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:02.920]   have been a a fast and neat and clean CEO search that's not the Twitter we know we love.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:09.160]   It's a hot mess Twitter it's a hot mess and we love really is I mean this is it's a dog's
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:16.640]   breakfast dogs breakfast and yet we can't live without it it's the dial tone of the Internet.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:17.920]   So I'm.
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:18.920]   Little more.
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:19.920]   Yes.
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:20.920]   Huh.
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:21.920]   Or is the new.
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:22.920]   Or is it.
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.120]   Yeah I guess it's kind of like that I don't think that's a good thing to say but.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:27.920]   Well it is kind of is RSS just yeah.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:33.560]   So it's out of control it's RSS if if we're out of control and like the.
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:34.560]   The.
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:36.560]   R is for random.
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:42.120]   Random yes yes GoPro which announced it was going to do a multi camera virtual reality
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:46.280]   camera has says yeah it's coming out November and it's $15,000.
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:49.680]   Oh man Alex has ordered three of them you want to bet.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:55.040]   Oh man I did the calculations and I thought well if it's got 16 go pros in it shouldn't
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.920]   be more than $6,000 I guess I was wrong.
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:59.560]   A tape.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:02.400]   It's expensive to glue it together.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:06.880]   You know I'm going to buy this theta S I figure so.
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.240]   This is this is the 3D the Rico 3D camera that you just hold and it does you shoot video
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:15.200]   that's completely surround video.
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:18.160]   It's only a couple hundred bucks.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:21.200]   And I'm a stream that to YouTube.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.640]   And then I figured it all out.
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.080]   I'm just going to be here doing a vlog and then on the other side of me there's going
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:31.000]   to be a bunch of crazy people you know naked dancing and stuff.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:36.040]   It'll be like I burning man on one side but unless you turn around you won't notice.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:38.560]   We are all rolling head late now.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:45.440]   Yes we need to do another old man reference the Dunesbury character were all.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:46.600]   Where's our 3D periscope.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.600]   I love this.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.960]   Yes 3D periscope.
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:54.040]   Amazon's finally stopped selling the fire phone.
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.040]   Somebody had chat rooms that I bought.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:56.360]   He stopped selling it a lot of time.
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:00.040]   I thought it's a no there's a guy in the chat room who bought it the day before they
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:02.200]   stopped selling it.
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:03.200]   Nice timing.
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.040]   I've got one mind the collector's item now I'm really happy about that.
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.640]   I gave mine a Devorak I thought that was a good use of it.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:16.280]   No it reminds me of a world where it reminds me of the fundamentals difference between
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:22.760]   Amazon and Apple where a lot of times Steve Jobs wouldn't get his way and Jeff Bezos got
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:23.760]   his way with the fire phone.
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:26.320]   There weren't enough people there to say no no this is a terrible idea we're going to
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:29.280]   do this this and this and not this and he would curse at them go off say they're all
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:32.080]   going to fail and he'd fire them but then it would work out and everyone would be fine.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:35.240]   You always need those people to tell you no.
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:41.760]   To his credit though and to Amazon's credit they learn from their mistake and they're
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.160]   not trying to do version two and they're like I mean the issue is that they're not trying
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.160]   to do version two and they're like the issue is that they're not trying to do version two
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:44.160]   and they're like I mean the issue is that they're not trying to do version two and they're
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:49.600]   like I mean the issue is Amazon is a horizontal services company that needs to be reaching
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:57.120]   people on every platform not trying to own the one and yes you're right it should never
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:01.160]   remain the first place and probably all of us definitely including myself were saying
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:07.960]   it was a bad idea from the beginning but that said if you're going to do the wrong
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:13.360]   thing at least learn from it and change going forward and they have and look at Microsoft
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:18.160]   they made the can and then they realized oh no Windows phone is the way and then seven
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.080]   was the way and then eight now ten.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:27.560]   Well you know that's why Nadella though deserves credit because it was important that Microsoft
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:33.320]   was at that event and it was important because what matters to Microsoft is not Windows what
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:40.440]   matters to Microsoft is that Windows is now is when Windows was the market Microsoft the
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:43.480]   great thing when it up ways you don't need I talk about whole distinction before about
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:47.280]   about being a scale offering or being like a niche offering when you're a monopoly you
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:51.360]   get to be both like it's life's very easy and so my wife never had to make these kind
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:56.560]   of trade off decisions are we going to be focused on a vertical area or we focus on
[02:30:56.560 --> 02:31:01.040]   a horizontal scale play and now they do have to make decisions because Windows is no longer
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:07.040]   the whole thing it's only a part of the market and Microsoft's by nature and by business
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:12.280]   model and by history is a scale company there are horizontal platform sort of company which
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:17.360]   means they needed to abandon Windows I mean yes Windows is still being produced and things
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:22.120]   but it's clearly often it's corner and it's doing its thing and the focus of the company
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:26.840]   and all the growth is on platforms that are on when that are on Windows and are on iOS
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:31.320]   on Android or on the web and that's exactly right exactly what they should be doing doesn't
