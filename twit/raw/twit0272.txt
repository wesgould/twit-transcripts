[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.560]   This weekend tech, the show that covers all the tech news.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.320]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.080]   I'm Lee Olaport.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.120]   And we've got such a crowded studio today.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.440]   We rarely have our entire panel and studio.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   And when I built this studio, I never
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.160]   imagined that we'd need any more than one or two cameras.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.760]   But now I'm wishing we had seven or eight cameras.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.120]   There he is.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.000]   That's Le Week Le Muir from Le Web and Seismic.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.960]   Hey, entrepreneur, pull the microphone right up
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.600]   into your face there.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.080]   Sure.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   Right up in my face.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.960]   There you go.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.440]   And we hear you have such a great voice.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.880]   Very good.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.600]   How can I describe you, Le Week?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   Entrepreneur?
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920]   Yeah, I created five startups.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.960]   So I guess that's a good--
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.920]   You're on your fifth startup.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.120]   And you also do conferences, and Le Web is coming up in Paris.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.280]   I did these to help you up with startups and entrepreneurs,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.360]   raise money, and get ideas, get inspired.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.240]   That's exciting.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.200]   2,500 people coming from 50 countries.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.280]   They'll be at Le Doc.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.520]   And Le Olaport is going to be there.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.880]   I will be there.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.040]   We're going to do a show from there, which is going to be fun.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.480]   That's December 8th and 9th.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   Absolutely.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.840]   Le Web.net.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.920]   Net, if you want to know more.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.640]   John C. de Vorak is wearing his Mouni outfit
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.360]   for Halloween.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   Hello, John.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   That's good.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.280]   You look good.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.840]   That's my hat.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.040]   He actually looks like Smokey the Bear.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.480]   Say this.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.920]   John say, only you could--
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520]   Only you can prevent forest fire.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.280]   There he is.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.200]   This looks good.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   John is on some sort of drug that doesn't allow him to consume.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.720]   So I'm consuming water.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.840]   You're having water, and the rest of us are drinking wine,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   a fine wine, a zinfandel today.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   Yeah, I'm not missing much.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.360]   Believe me.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.800]   Oh, he's pretty good.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   And he's such a nice guy.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.760]   To John's right, he is being very nice.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.640]   He's very, very unfrench.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   To John's right.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.280]   This is crap.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   Wait until I finish his dress.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   I wrote it to you.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   You'll like it better.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.280]   Right.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.200]   To John's right, Lisa Bettany, mostly Lisa.com.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   We haven't had you on an age, and you know why.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   Why?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.160]   Because of camera plus.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.120]   Zip, can you not talk about that still?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.680]   OK, so we won't say a word.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   We don't know what it is.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.600]   We won't talk about it.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   We have no idea what happened.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.720]   And when you can talk about it, come back and let us know.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.000]   Is it the reason you can't talk?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.520]   Is it being litigated, or is there something going on?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   All I can say is we're working with Apple,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.400]   and we're optimistic.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.960]   Good.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.880]   That's good.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.240]   We're optimistic.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.720]   That's good.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.320]   We're working with Apple and we're optimistic.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   And optimistic in the same sentence.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   Usually you don't hear that.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.720]   It's kind of an unusual combination, isn't it?
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.680]   It's just for people who don't know.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.600]   And by the way, hi, I'm over here.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.480]   If you're watching the video, I don't know what happened.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.400]   We lost a camera.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.160]   I don't know what happened.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.600]   I have no excuse for this.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.680]   Camera Plus is a very popular iPhone app
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.360]   that sold half a million dollars worth in the first month,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.160]   I think.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.440]   It was very successful.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.480]   I won't put the camera on you, Lisa, so you don't have to feign
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320]   ignorance.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.240]   But then got pulled from the app store.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.640]   We're not sure by whom, but we do know why,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.120]   because in fact, I still have it on here,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.080]   because it allowed you to change the physical hardware
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.400]   on the phone so that you could use the volume controls
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.440]   to snap a picture.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.120]   Turning the iPhone 4 into something that's really
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   much more like a point and shoot camera.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.200]   I love the idea.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.440]   I pulled quite rightly said it's against our rules.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.720]   You can't do that.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.120]   And there's a disagreement at that point.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.720]   So you're optimistic that something will come up.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.280]   We're working with them.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   And we haven't just sat by and done nothing.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   So we're working on everything.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.080]   But yeah, we are optimistic at this point,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.320]   but it's in their hands.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.960]   And I might say one of the things Lisa and I
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.120]   are working on is a camera show.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.620]   Yes.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.720]   We really hope to get this off the ground very quickly.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.400]   And this will be more of a how-to show.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.920]   Yeah, I really want it to be do it yourself with whatever
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.880]   camera you have, because how I started
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.840]   was with really no gear making things out of the duct tape
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.960]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.080]   So that's what I wanted.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   What I want to, because a lot of what you see on podcasts,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.040]   and even our own This Week in Photography show
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.760]   that Alex Lindsey did here, is for high-end enthusiasts,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   people who can afford anything.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.800]   Although I have to say, we got Lo-Week with his 5D Mark II.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.120]   We've got John with his Panasonic GH1.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.960]   We got-- I mean, the cameras here are flying.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.920]   This has got a 1.2 lens in it.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.760]   I know.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.260]   Pretty sweet.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.920]   Hey, John.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.960]   Make a killer.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.000]   That's super fast.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.200]   It does glass in it.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.640]   That's got a lot of glass.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.040]   So now we've already turned this into a snobby photo show.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   No, it's actually mine.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   I'm lending it to me.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.800]   What cameras do you have?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.000]   Plenty.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.440]   What do you buy every camera that comes out?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.920]   Close to it.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.480]   Most of them?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.160]   No.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040]   You have to have the cameras here or--
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.520]   I feel it's my job to buy it.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.880]   You're using my new MacBook Air.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.640]   What do you think of that?
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.480]   The 11 in share?
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.160]   I like it.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560]   It's a little small.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.240]   Lo-Week--
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.200]   It's really fast.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   It's really fast.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.560]   I've switched like--
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.240]   It's late.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.760]   It's been two days, and it's as fast as like a regular one.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.600]   I don't longer use my 15.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.640]   It's so light.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.840]   And frankly, it kind of replaces the iPad for me.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.680]   I have to wonder if Apple might lose some sales to this.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.960]   I guess people like keyboard.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.880]   Live two ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.760]   Put life two.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.640]   Oh, we will shut you back to the main best chat.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.160]   This is fine.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.960]   I prefer being with the overflow.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.480]   The people?
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.640]   No, it's very cool.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.160]   It's a surprise for me, of course.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.400]   This is my book Air.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.040]   Did you have a MacBook Air, the original?
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440]   Yeah, that was very slow.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   That was horribly slow.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   Yeah, I did not buy one for that reason.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.480]   Exactly.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.240]   And it overheated.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.640]   It had a terrible overheating problem.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.280]   I think it's mostly linked to a flash memory hard drive,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.600]   right, which so fast it enhances everything.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560]   It's pretty clear, in fact, after you use this,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.240]   that really nowadays processors are more than fast enough
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   that what's really slowing a computer down is drive access.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.440]   You speed up drive access even a little bit with an SSD,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.560]   which they've done here.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.840]   And it boots in 15 seconds.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.280]   It launches an app and in one bounce or less.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.080]   And you fire it with like Skype and Evernote and 15
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.280]   types in your browser.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.200]   Because Skype is just disabled.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.520]   I really try to make it go slow.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.440]   And I could not so far.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.160]   Oh, don't worry about it.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   It'll have monotone.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.040]   It'll slow down just fine in a little bit.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.840]   Let's talk about the mobile event.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.040]   You're kind of into mobile a little bit low week.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   Or you were with Cismic.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.280]   You did the mobile video and so forth.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.560]   Oh, Cismic does Android, Blackberry, iPhone.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.520]   And you do mobile apps.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.720]   Yeah, and you have Windows Phone 7 since last week.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.600]   So you're into mobile.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.520]   You've asked a Cismic for Windows 7?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.640]   We have it since last week.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.600]   Oh, congratulations.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800]   We have our social networking apps,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.120]   bringing Facebook, Twitter, and more in one app.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.520]   And we have it since last week.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   We had our desktop on Silverlight, Microsoft.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.200]   And it's the same code base as for the phone.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.960]   So it's easy.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.400]   Easy.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.120]   We did it in half the time it took us to do the iPhone apps.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.000]   There's a strong app argument for WPF and Silverlight.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.520]   It's been very nice to code on.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.760]   The team is really happy.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.440]   And--
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.360]   Now, what do you think Twitter made an announcement this week
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.440]   about trademarks and the use of the word tweet?
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.800]   And one of the things they said, which
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   would directly impact you, is they're not really crazy
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.400]   about you using any of the Twitter marks in an application
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.560]   that is more than Twitter.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.600]   And you are more than Twitter.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   Yeah, but that's why it's called Cismic.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.080]   It's not called tweet something.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.600]   Tweet thing.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.120]   Yeah, Tweet deck is another one that's going to have a problem.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.920]   I don't know about that.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.760]   I would doubt--
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.640]   Should I take an action earlier, it seems to me.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.120]   Twitter or Twitter?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.880]   I think in general, it's not very smart to call your own brand.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.320]   You don't own the brand.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.440]   You use someone else.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.040]   It's like if I called my next company, Liola Porti,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.560]   something--
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.400]   That'd be a mistake.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.900]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.800]   Are you starting a podcast network called This Week In?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.300]   Right.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.240]   Oh, for who would do something like that?
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.960]   That'd be nuts.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.720]   It'd be crazy.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.640]   You wouldn't want to do that.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.480]   And I have no idea who you're referring to.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.000]   Or if after Twitter, you start a podcast network called Twit.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.960]   But of course, we proceeded Twitter.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.400]   I'd like to point out.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.760]   It's pointless, but I'd like to point it out anyway.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.200]   Twit was here first.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.640]   Damn it.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.600]   What is that light over there?
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   And now we'll take a break to answer John's question.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.200]   What light?
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.760]   Over where?
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.240]   There's all the little dots.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.960]   You don't see others of them around?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.880]   Yeah, there's a couple.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   Those are called.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.120]   So we're in a video studio.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.880]   How do you like that sepia shot?
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   We're in a video--
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   Oh.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   Oh.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   Oh.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.840]   Oh.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.320]   It seems that my camera's gone into demo mode.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.720]   And now I'm--
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.560]   There it looks better.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.080]   This is good.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.800]   This is the FBI witness protection program mode.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.680]   One more glass of that wine and you
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   will be pixelated.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Oh, that's picky.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   Oh, she sits our Halloween radio.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Halloween edition.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   Great lit radio.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.760]   Moving along, top stories.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.360]   Facebook's going to do an event on Wednesday.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.200]   They say it's a mobile event, November 3rd.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.440]   Anybody have any thoughts about what--
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.280]   Facebook's really been--
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   I got some thoughts.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   --that stuff out like crazy.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   What are they going to do?
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.640]   So they bought out I/O drop.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.160]   Drop out.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.640]   Drop out.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   I'm so mad.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   I know I love that.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.400]   Everybody was relying on that.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   I'm so mad about that.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.720]   You guys say we sold to Facebook, screw you.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   They did.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   They shut it down.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   Now, what they really wanted was Sam Lesson.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   You must know Sam, Louie.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.560]   I mean, he's really a great guy.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.960]   I don't know him personally, but I know all of you, man.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   Yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   So he's a real acquisition.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   We'll have a great guy.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.440]   We'll see if he shuts down the side.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   Well, he didn't.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   Facebook did.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   But he, of course, agreed to be--
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   Shut down.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   Shut down.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   Mark Zuckerberg said very clearly we have never bought a company for the company's assets.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.720]   We always buy it for the engineers.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   Well, they decide running then.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.480]   Which is the same as Friend Feed, right?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   They left Friend Feed running.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   I mean, it's kind of neglected.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.240]   But they did leave it running.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.200]   But I think Droppio was such a great tool.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.440]   I really missed Droppio.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   I'm going to miss Droppio.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.160]   You can't sign up now for an app.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.920]   I guess Dropp box would be the other.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   Is it?
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   Is it as good?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   It's not.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.280]   I mean, you can't just send it randomly.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.040]   But I mean, I use Dropp box for everything.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.360]   I signed up for a new service.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.680]   I'm going to see if it's as good.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.520]   They tweeted, oh, all you Droppio.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.120]   Some people come to us.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.760]   It's called Toydoyd.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   I don't know what you got.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   It's great.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.600]   I can't remember the name companies.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   I mean, I'll find it here.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.480]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.880]   But the idea of it is that you right click on any file on your own computer if you have
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.760]   an account and it will automatically share it publicly.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.880]   So it's kind of like Droppio.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.800]   But nobody's got the Droppio functionality.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   That was a really great.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.600]   I think Facebook will like more announce, you know, they have a set of libraries already
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.920]   for Blackberry, for iPhone, for Android that you as a developer, you just take it into
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.400]   is that what you're using for seismic?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   Yeah, for like, for example, for Blackberry, seismic on Blackberry only has Twitter and
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.680]   we want to add Facebook, they have a Blackberry.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680]   Oh, that's not nice.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.480]   Library, which has like, which is like a month old only.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.560]   And I think they just want to replace your address book in your phone.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.760]   And what I'm expecting is like a very deep integration to a phone and more libraries
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   like this.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.960]   Also, I think Zukas changes mind from web based only being, you know, kind of everything
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.480]   into a native app.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.000]   So probably an iPad app that could be really, you know, there is there is no sense.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.480]   There is a Facebook app on the iPhone, but there is none on the iPad.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   Right.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.400]   And not on well, I guess it's never been very important for them.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.960]   And I hear from like, friends at Facebook that is getting into more and more.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.800]   So you're saying their focus was to pull you there on the website and actually the iPad
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.160]   experience on Safari and Facebook is great.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   It's great.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   You don't need really.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.040]   I don't know, but I think, I think they, they are getting more and more into native,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.080]   which I think is good for the users.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.680]   Mm hmm.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.360]   Native meaning.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   Meaning, meaning you have an app and actual app and not only web based.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.920]   They truthfully, they should care how you get on it as long as you're using Facebook.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.440]   Well, except they want to replace via, they completely want to be kind of not the OS
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   of the phone, but they want to be your address book.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   Right.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   Right.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.720]   Because they are the world's address book with 100 million, right?
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Right.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   And they're better than plaque.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.520]   So if you keep your stats up to date.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.840]   So you buy any phone, you just connect to Facebook and hope you have all your address
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   book.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.360]   Plus the pictures of exactly.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.400]   So this is the program that they, they were tweeting saying, we, we could replace drop
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   you.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.320]   It's tonito, T-O-N-I-D-O dot com.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   And they both sell.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   What's that name?
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   I don't know.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   It's confusing.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   You know what it is, John?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   You can't find any more domains.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   You can't, you can no longer own a domain that hasn't been taken.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   Right?
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.520]   No, actually you can come up with baby talk.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.000]   The words are coming up there.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Where'd you get the name?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Seesmik Loig.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   Oh, um, which is a good name.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   It's a great name.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   Seesmik.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   Seesmik.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   Sees the day.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.960]   And the, I see you, you see me.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.600]   Intel has this basic theory that they, well, it wasn't their theory.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.640]   It was these naming convention guys.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.600]   The idea wasn't, and of course it was adopted by AMD and others, is that you want the name
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.560]   to infer and imply different meanings.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.000]   So when you had Pentium, you know, you had like, it was also like a two-state.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.400]   It was also Pentagram for all you witchcraft.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.680]   I mean, Pent, this, you know, and there's a, Cristina Donald.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.920]   And then the AMD chips all have an athletic, Athlon.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.320]   It sounds like athletic.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.280]   It sounds like marathon.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.680]   It sounds like athlete.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.040]   So that's why I named this company Twit.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   Because you're minding a bunch of trip calls.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   Jomorrah.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   Absolutely.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Perfect.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   Very good name.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   Great name.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.120]   So Seesmik is just, but now you started as a video.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.280]   You started as a video company.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.480]   So you completely changed.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.880]   No, it didn't, it wasn't related to video either.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.520]   I think, I think as an entrepreneur, you need to like find names which are not close to
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.000]   brands that could like attack you.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.400]   But second Twitter like that, you mean?
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   For example, nothing with Twit.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.560]   They didn't exist when I named this company.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.720]   It was ODO.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.000]   And actually we had a chat about this name of this company.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.320]   And you were at one point thinking of not using it.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Remember?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   I know.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   I wish I had done something else.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   But like we've already done.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.640]   You got the best name in the world.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   Actually, I guess you're right now.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   It's okay.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   I have a similar one.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.080]   I have acquired a little company called Ping FM.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   Which allows you.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   Ping, yeah, you buy Ping.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   That's right.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   Right.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.080]   And then Apple launches Ping.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.080]   Ping.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.080]   So what do you do?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   Lawsuit.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   Well, you...
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   Well, first you try to wonder if you actually are going to be sued or not.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   You see why?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   They might sue you.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   Yeah, because I think it is.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.960]   You have a golf brand which also, you know, which actually has a trade.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.520]   Ping is a golf company too.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   Right.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   So it gets actually a little company.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.560]   But when you get a trade, as my understanding, when you get a trademark, you get it in an
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.560]   area.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   And a trade...
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.240]   Twit is a trademark in producing audio and video for the internet.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.640]   So when I went to Twitter, they said, "Well, that's fine because we're social media,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   your podcasts, and the trademarks are in different areas.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   They don't conflict."
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.200]   And I think I accepted that.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.720]   So I say the same thing with Ping, except the Ping FM and Ping Apple, they're similar.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.800]   Yeah, actually Ping FM would be a great name for them.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.000]   I should probably sell them.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You just sell it to them.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Hey, Apple.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I do actually...
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I use Seize McDevs stop.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I love Seize McDevs stop.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   That's a silver light app.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Yes.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So it's PC and Mac, and it has 55 plugins.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.800]   So you can add, you know, a lot of services, for example, NIN or very cool ones, like very
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.160]   is a last FM plugin where you can even listen to music.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.000]   We should do a tweet, a little app or plugin.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Oh, we could.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You could have all your latest shows and...
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So there's an API that makes it easy to do that.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Right.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And it's cool.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   That's cool.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.600]   People can get and you could have your shows there and play them right there.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.360]   So if you're 4-squared, are you terrified at this point?
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   Because Facebook's having this mobile event, you know, and Facebook, in fact, we found
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   out that more people have signed up for places by like a factor of 10 that have signed up
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   for 4-square.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.320]   4 million 4-square users, something like 40 million places users.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.200]   Although, I don't know if you use...
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.120]   Do you use Facebook places, Lisa?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.840]   I don't because when it was...
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   When it first came out, I wasn't able to do it in Canada.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.960]   And now when I do it, I can never add any of my friends to...
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   So I'm at this location and I can never add a friend.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.720]   It never ever works.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.240]   Because your friends have wised up and they say, "Well, you're not going to add us."
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   And also...
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.480]   Because you can change that to privacy setting.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   It is.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.640]   And even with someone who, like Pete has this problem as well, so we can't tag each other.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   So it's kind of like what's the point.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.720]   And 4-square and guala all feed into Facebook places anyways.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.640]   So and guala lets me take a picture at the same time, which is what I want to do.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   So you're guala?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   I am.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.200]   I like taking pictures and it's kind of just for me rather than I'm announcing to the
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   world where I am.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   Hey, where's that photo you're supposed to send me?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Come on, John.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   That's a sight.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   That's a sight conversation.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   It's a sight.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   Come on, John.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   Please, thank you.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.280]   You can't get commitments from anybody unless you have them on the air.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   She's busy doing things.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   No, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.960]   The one you were going to send, that one that was that weird shot that I sent, it was
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.000]   on your website that's got the...
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.360]   She already forgot.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.080]   She says a really accomplished photographer.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.520]   She has some shots that are necessary to have on the wall.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   I think so.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.640]   I've actually never printed any of myself.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   Printed at all?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   What does that mean?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.720]   The thing I'll print it.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   My walls are blank.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.000]   I kind of like to stare at a blank.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.760]   You should get one of those giant Epson printers like a 9800.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   I have that.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   I love that.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   Well, you have a 9800?
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   No, I don't have a 9800.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   I have the 5200.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   Something like that.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.760]   It's only one.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.760]   I'm talking about a 44-inch.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   I'm talking about a 44-inch.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   Oh, no.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   That's huge.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   I'm a 44-inch.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.360]   I know what you're talking about, John.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   Where the hell would you put such a thing?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   You put it in.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   You could have room in here.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   There's plenty of room out there for a 44-inch.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.760]   You could barely fit four people into this room.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.000]   And then you'd bring giant posters.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.320]   It's a side business.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.040]   So I actually still use 4-square to check in on Facebook.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.360]   I don't use places that often.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.160]   It's just one more thing.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.660]   I mean, it does...
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.800]   Like, when it first came out, I'm like, "Oh, this is great."
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   Then I won't have...
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.160]   Because I sort of have gone back between Guala and 4-square.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.640]   Which one is actually...
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.720]   Should people be afraid of Facebook?
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.480]   I mean, they really have become more and more dominant.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:38.720]   Well, I mean, obviously there's a problem with the whole...
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.760]   Whether they decide to just release your information.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   Well, there's that privacy issue.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.040]   But people should be afraid of Google for the same reason, right?
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.840]   But at the end of the day, it's kind of like just censor yourself before you put yourself
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   on the internet.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.560]   I... Laurie, you kind of live a little bit.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.480]   You're not exactly dependent on Facebook, but you live a little bit on the...
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.720]   Well, a little bit.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.920]   We have a lot of Facebook users.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.760]   And you kind of, of course, had Facebook in pretty much all our apps.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.200]   But so we're like, you know, the risk is limited because we're on the Twitter ecosystem.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   You were smart enough to diversify.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.600]   Would you worry if you were only Facebook, that app developer, for instance?
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.720]   I think it's very dangerous in general to be relying only on one platform.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.760]   And Facebook has been extremely fast in embracing new trends and the four square verses.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.680]   Look at the old Microsoft experience.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.280]   Hey, let me see what you got there, buddy.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.800]   Yeah, but what looks pretty good.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.680]   But on the other hand, Microsoft built a platform that everybody built upon.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.200]   I mean, all the...
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.840]   Because the Microsoft has steal their stuff.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.400]   Well, but that was the embrace in Gulf and Devour embrace and extend model.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.040]   So as long as you didn't let Microsoft in and...
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.200]   But they would do is it come to you and say, "We'd like to acquire you.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   Let us see everything."
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Yeah, they want you to...
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   And then open the common notes.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.560]   Once they'd seen everything, then they'd say, "Well, we decided not to buy you anyway."
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   Yeah, your stuff is dumb.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   We're just going to do our sales.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   We can do our sales.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.040]   You get as a startup, a lot of you shouldn't forget all the attraction you get.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   And actually, even four squares get in the...
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   Well, that's exactly it.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   That's exactly it.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.600]   So it's a platform, which is six...
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.040]   You know, I mean, Microsoft...
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.480]   We wouldn't have the PC revolution today if Microsoft hadn't come along and built a stable
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.720]   Windows platform that everybody could develop on.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   Yes, that's an erroneous...
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.680]   You don't think that's the case?
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   No.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   I don't think so at all.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Don't you need...
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.440]   I think somebody else would have come along.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.120]   It's always been that way in high tech.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   Somebody would have done it.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   But somebody had to do it.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   Microsoft happened to have done it.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   Yeah, somebody had to do it.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   If it had been digital research, they were...
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   DR-DOS.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.240]   If they had their act together at the time.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   Gary killed all, hadn't gone for a plane.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.840]   Although, you know, you have to say that, you know, if you remember, what was that one
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.280]   operating system that had the big fat arrow?
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   It was a pre...
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   It was one of the first GU-I.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   It was a gym or something.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.920]   Yeah, well, they went and pre-sold a whole bunch of people.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.840]   If you talk to the lawyer, Gary killed those lawyer.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.200]   And you hear these stories about how a gym was pre-sold to a whole bunch of companies
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.800]   and Bill Gates personally went from place to place to place to place and unsold the deals.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   Brilliant.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   See, but that's Bill Gates.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   And this was...
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   That's why it was Microsoft.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   Because Bill was a shark.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   Right.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.280]   But if it wasn't for Bill being a shark, somebody else would have come along and we still
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280]   would have had a good system.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   Because look at the Apple.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.080]   I mean, it wasn't sold that way.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.880]   It was more passive.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   But it's fine.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   But the reason I bring it up is because Facebook at this point, I'm sure, is thinking of itself
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   as a platform.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   Right.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.040]   They're saying, well, we don't want to own the universe.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.800]   We want everybody to live in our ecosystem.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   But then they also...
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.080]   It's like all of us platforms sometimes just shut down.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.040]   If you remember the way they change the way the apps can post to the stream.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Right.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.000]   Do you remember an app called SuperWall?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   That's gone.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   It's gone because you can't do it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.160]   You can use it to zero, I think.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.480]   So the risk is that they've developed a platform, but they're not consistently supporting the
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   developers.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   It's very risky.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.360]   The minute they decide you're too spammy or you're too...
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.960]   Or you make a deal with them like Zynga has grown so much in the game industry because
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.920]   they were the first ones to really jump into the social...
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.880]   But I noticed that Zynga is running its own servers now and as you can do Farmville on
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   the iPad...
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   iPhone.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   And the iPhone.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   They've clearly said, well, we're not going to put all our eggs in the face.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.960]   And also they're giving a lot of money to Facebook.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   They're paying Facebook.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.400]   They share revenues, they buy all of out of the time.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.680]   So Facebook has an incentive for them to see.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.880]   But see, this was changed because Microsoft didn't take...
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.560]   That's what Apple wants to do with its app store.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.040]   Microsoft didn't take a cut of all the software sold on Windows.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.960]   Now they probably regret that by the way.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.040]   They wish they'd thought of that, but they didn't do it.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   Now these models change a lot.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   And they made a stable API.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.200]   And if there's one thing you could say Microsoft did for better or for worse, it was support
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.680]   legacy software.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.520]   They were very careful never to change Windows.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.280]   They modeled themselves after IBM, which was a huge legacy freak.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.400]   And Microsoft wanted to send them.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.440]   So here's the question.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   Should Facebook be operating that way?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.640]   Or I mean, they're certainly short term better for them to be cut throat and protect the
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.360]   platform.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.960]   But it doesn't scare away developers too.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.800]   I mean, doesn't that hurt the ecosystem?
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.120]   I think they're really becoming the social platform.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.400]   So you have to play.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.800]   I think you have to play.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.400]   And I think they might have to be users, right?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.560]   It's a question of risk against the.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.680]   So they're actually operating.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   You have to.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.560]   They're operating from such a position of strength and power.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.080]   They might as well abuse it.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.480]   They might as well squeeze everybody's.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.080]   Silicon Valley model.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.520]   They're the first real chancer to Google.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   Yeah, they are.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:38.040]   Because if you do search in terms of social, you get so much more information by the filter
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.360]   of your friends, of course.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   Google knows this.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.280]   They have meetings once in a while, I'm sure.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   They say, what are we going to do?
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   I don't know.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   Let's see what their next move is.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   We'll figure it out.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.620]   Yeah, let's do like, you know, Microsoft do with, you know, windows won't run till
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.620]   Lotus won't go.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.320]   Windows won't be done until Lotus won't run.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   All right.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   Kind of modeled.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.960]   Google can pull something off.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.200]   So it's going to be a very small backlash for dropio because but those of us who use
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.920]   and love dropio are going to be pissed off that Facebook did this.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.720]   I have to say, and that's all Facebook did.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   All of our heart on no agenda is was the use dropio.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.520]   I love dropio and I don't know if I should be mad at Sam lesson or be mad at Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.320]   Who should I blame them all?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.800]   Yeah, they're all sons of bitches.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:29.320]   Most of Leo's like opening up his vocabulary with.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.880]   I'm inspired by no agenda.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   I've got to.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   I think that street are gone.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.000]   I think that I've learned from you guys.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.240]   Adam's got to follow mouth.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   What can I say?
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   He does.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   And it's rarely I rarely nobody paid $303 to $3.33 to be producer on this show.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   Although I told you after I mentioned that you want to get into the fourth thing.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   How much money?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   Okay, let's talk about Ford actually.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.400]   Let's be good time to mention for it.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   Wow.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.680]   Am I good or what?
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.240]   I want you to drive a Ford Fiesta.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.840]   How am I going to do a commercial from over here?
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   Okay, I'm going to have to.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   Let's get back here.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   Hey, everybody.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.680]   Hey, everybody, Leo LaPor here.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.640]   This is not going to work.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   We had such a good time.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.920]   We went to the Rouge plant in Detroit, which is where the power of industrial America in
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.120]   many ways was born.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.720]   This is the plant that Henry Ford built in the 20s when he realized that so many people
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:29.520]   were going to buy Ford automobiles that he needed to control the entire chain in the
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   Rouge plant would arrive by ship metal.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   Not even metals.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.880]   Iron ore would arrive by a box car.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   At the other end of the plant, a car would come out.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   Just an amazing place.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.200]   In the 21st century, I think Ford is reinventing itself.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.680]   Now go to the Rouge plant.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.920]   We went to it's light, it's sunny.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:55.760]   They have a green roof that's actually growing, which helps them keep it cool, absorbs water,
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.920]   really helps the environment.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.800]   It's really pretty an amazing place.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.280]   If you get a chance, if you're in the Dearborn area, they do have tours of it.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.880]   It's just amazing.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.160]   Once you see how they're building their automobiles, you get a real sense of pride in the fact
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.480]   that what I thought was dying, frankly, which was an industrial America is actually turning
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.000]   the corner in the 21st century.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.720]   They took no money from the government.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   They're profitable.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   They're doing a great job.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:28.120]   I want you to take a look at the Ford Fiesta, just a spectacular new car with an EPA estimated
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   40 highway miles per gallon.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.360]   No other compact car is more fuel efficient, and that's just the beginning.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.160]   Oh, don't laugh at John.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.800]   It just eggs him on.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   Where's the glasses?
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   Get John the glasses.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   They were much.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.360]   It's not complete, John, unless you have the glasses.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   We'll get you the glasses.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   It's like an old woman.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   You do.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   That's why I'm saying you need the glasses.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   There's the glasses right there.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.640]   The glasses kind of, without the glasses, nobody knows that you're the king of rock and
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   roll.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   Toss.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   Oh man.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   Everybody.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   This is the Halloween edition.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   It is.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   John, you look like Larry Bud Melman.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   They are much bigger.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   They are much bigger.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   But Melman.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   Thanks.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   Dave of...
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.240]   John C. DeWorack.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   As Larry Bud Melman.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   You can't remember what I was saying.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   In the Larry Bud Melman story.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.440]   I can't read the prompter.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:27.240]   In a time when one man, short, fat, and bald, could own the entire media empire.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.480]   You know I worry because every time I come here something like this happens and people
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   blame it on me.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   It's your fault.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   They think you are at fault?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.280]   You're a trouble maker.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.000]   I create the hat madness.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Really?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Oh no.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I'd be like, oh, it's not Lisa's fault.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It is her fault.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   It's not Lisa's fault.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   We're just trying to show off where to get her attention.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   This is how it is.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.560]   Oh, you're showing off.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   You're right.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   You know what?
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   You're right.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   You're the one that was showing off your gut a minute ago.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.240]   So that's like, oh, did I actually bear my midriff?
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.480]   Yeah, I'm so sorry.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.040]   That must have been a very, that is not.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.960]   I'll be honest with you, John.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   Clearly not calculated to win a woman's heart.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.920]   Let me just put it that way.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.000]   If I had a six pack, okay, maybe pulling out the kerosene.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.560]   We didn't want the fire.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.440]   EcoBoost V six engine in this Fiesta is incredible.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   365 horsepower.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   That's standard in the SHO.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.920]   The Ford Fiesta has the-- oh, I wish I could remember the acronym.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.200]   The really cool, high efficiency engine is just very peppy.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   It is.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   That's how SHO means.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.280]   But no, I mean the-- it's the TI-VCT engine in the Fiesta.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.360]   It's just an awesome, awesome car.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   I want you to take a look at Ford.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.480]   And of course, all of those cars, you get the Ford Sync, and that's so key.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.560]   Take a drive today at a Ford dealer near you, the Ford Fiesta, and take a look at the Ford
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.080]   Sync the Hands Free.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.080]   Awesome.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.360]   So they won some advertising award recently for their advertising.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.640]   Did you see-- well, they do these great viral things like the Land and Game versus Fiesta.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   These four guys must have some on the ball.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   They're the only guys I know that they are.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   They are.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   They're not a trivial thing to do.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.360]   No, they're very-- they're savvy.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   They're savvy.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   I was exactly the word I would use.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.920]   They were at Blog World doing test drives because they want bloggers to be-- now she's
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   got the--
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.480]   Do you have this card back in here?
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   Yes.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.360]   Hey, will you stop touching these out of these?
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   John, come on.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.360]   What did he just say?
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   I don't understand.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   Go at the party.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   I said stop touching Lisa, I agree.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   I would grab the lease.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   I understand.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   Maybe I should try friends.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.040]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.440]   Do your French accent, Leo.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.800]   No, because if I do the French accent with the Louis Quixote, I would be embarrassing.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.240]   Perhaps he would say it is insulting to the--
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   No, no, no.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   We never insulted Leo.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   You know--
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   I know one thing.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.400]   And on for say, they love the American accent because Americans-- it's very cute, isn't
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   it?
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   Yes.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   It's very good.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   No, no.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   I really like your accent, Leo.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   Wait.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Wait.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   Wait.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   I say why because it sounds like I'm saying, yeah.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   So you're getting ready to party?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   Oh, wait.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   They're looking for one.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   Just we are--
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   If they are very-- they come on-- they should be very useful.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   Ah, yeah.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   Very good.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.320]   Seriously, I'm telling you, I've actually had--
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.880]   I have a contract in the show and she's not supposed to be here.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   I don't have to present in French, do I, Leo.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   Oh, did I not tell you?
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   Oh, crap.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   You're going to be in Paris, sure.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   Oh, in Paris, sure.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   I'll be in France.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.800]   You know, I was going to go to Paris this week for the broadband conference and I just
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   said no because they're on strike.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   It's going to get--
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   That's not--
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   That's strike will be done, right, Louis?
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   Oh, I don't care if I get stuck in Paris.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   I really don't.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   No, no.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   This is--
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   So, near this mass--
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   Nobody strikes.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   --and then it strikes-- stop the strikes because we have to rest--
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.080]   We have to rest for Christmas.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.960]   We're getting the time off anyway, so right strike.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   Exactly.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.160]   No strikes in December, I hope.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.480]   So I'm going to do on the 8th between-- well, it will be in Paris, it'll be 6 p.m., but here
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.720]   it'll be, I think, 9 a.m.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   Right.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   And we will stream it live.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.360]   You stream the whole thing live via you stream, don't you?
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.960]   Yeah, we had 250,000 people watch live.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   We have 210,000 people.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   So what is the show?
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   What's it first?
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   Le Web.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   It's Le Web.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   The Le Web show.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   So that's the slow week show.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   We're going to the Le Web show.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   You're going to the Le Web show.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.960]   Oh, it's the Le Web guy.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   Scoble talks about Mike Erington goes every year.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.280]   That was the year-- a couple of years ago that Mike Erington--
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   That fits you beautifully.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   You should wear the--
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   I'll keep it.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   --is wearing the Uncle Sam.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.960]   It's in Paris, and it's all in English.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.160]   And when we started, we said, if you don't speak English, don't show up.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.120]   And the French press loved it, of course.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   We did it at the same day.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.720]   But then Mike Erington said European entrepreneurs are lazy.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.280]   Yeah, Mike showed up and said--
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   And told the ladies about it.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   --that it's a known fact.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   Well, he's been--
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   It's too late.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   You can't go now.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   It's all right.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   He's been sick.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.280]   I never get invited to these things.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   I'm snubbed.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   Well, I'm happy to invite you right now.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   Too late.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   I can't go now.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   I can't afford to do this.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.280]   He's clever this way.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.280]   Well, actually, Leza is coming.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   Is she?
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   I am.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   She--
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   Are you?
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   Everyone goes to the Le Web.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   You're going?
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   I'm going.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   I didn't know that.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   You really go.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   I don't know that either.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   Great.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   My voice did go up, didn't it?
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   It went up a little bit.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.280]   How exciting.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   So, yeah, you're not going to say that the Europeans are lazy, right?
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   Hell no.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   You should.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   No, you know what?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   Don't be cowed by this guy.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   I aspire to the European way you enjoy life.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   You don't work 70, 80 hours a week.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   You take August off.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   But you still accomplish something.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   Look at me.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   I work 11 to 2, 30 every time.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   Right.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   Exactly.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   And then I have a long lunch.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   I take a nap.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   And that's done.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   I'm done for the day.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   I'm done for the day.

[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   He works possibly 20 hours a day.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   It's that focus that I wish
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   I would have known from age 13 on.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   Exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   Lisa, because you were a figure skater.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   I was a figure skater.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   You were working towards the Olympics.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   You had that kind of drive.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   You couldn't have done it without that kind of drive.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   But to start that early in tech.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   Because I just...
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.280]   Well, you blew it.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   It's not your fault.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   Who knew that was...
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   Lisa had an accident.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   I dropped her on her head.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   It was a flat spot.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   He has a soft spot on his head.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   I knew my font nail never closed.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   It's a sad story.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   Do entrepreneurs, somebody's asking the chat,
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   "M Adrian wants to know,
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   make good spouses or boyfriends?"
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.280]   I think Adrian wants to know if you're available.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   Nah, make lousy ones.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   I'm not gonna be able to get home.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   No, he's not watching.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   He's writing right now.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   He probably is watching to see what he's not watching.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.280]   You're constantly hitting on this poor woman.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Me!
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   Solution is to get two entrepreneurs together.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   Yeah, I mean, I'm a workaholic as well.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   So it works out really well.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   You have that drive.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   Absolutely.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   That we can have dinner in front of our computers
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   and not talk.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   Right.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   In your bed, you can tweet yourself.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   Zero Dean, is she an entrepreneur?
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   Yeah, I'm actually completely full of it, as always,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   because she actually organizes the entire conference.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   She does, yeah.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   95% more.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   My time is going to seismic.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   And she does everything.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   So I host the nice invite speakers.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   What is your... I mean, Ev has a family.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   A lot of entrepreneurs have families.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   We were talking with Jay Adelson.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   We did a great interview with Jay Adelson earlier this week.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   And he talked about startups as an addiction.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   He said, "I said..."
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   Because we were talking about the stress of being for sale,
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   because Dig was for sale a couple of times
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   and went through all the due diligence.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   And you don't know if you're sold yet, the lawyers get in.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   And just the stress of it.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   I said, "How do you survive?"
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   They said, "Survive it. I'm addicted to it.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   I have to have that.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   I have to have that daily. What are we going to do?
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   What's next? How do we survive?"
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   It's definitely not about money.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   It's not about money.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   That's a passion of building something.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   And then if you fail, it's okay.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   You rather avoid it, but we have three kids if you...
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   We were asking about family.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   We also have three kids.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   I know you do.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   Do you remember their names?
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   I'm training them to be entrepreneurs too, so I'm solving them.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   How do you train somebody to be an entrepreneur?
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   No, I don't know.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.280]   Make them work.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   Well, get to work.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   This is your five. Get to work.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   This is a somewhat legitimate question,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   because I am on the board of trustees of the local high school.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.280]   And I'm of the opinion that the best thing you can teach kids today
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   is not to be a good worker and a cubicle, but how to do their own thing.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   You need to inspire them.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   And I think what you have in this country, which is really cool,
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   that entrepreneurs are generally heroes.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   They are.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Your jobs are heroes.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   Celebrated.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   Google's Googles Fanders, Jage, and Nari are heroes.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   Well, in Europe, generally, it's more like you hide success.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   You don't show it.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   I think that's amazing.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   In Mexico, you get kidnapped.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   But I would say that's the best way, though,
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   is really to show away.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   And, you know, actually the Facebook movie, seeing Zuc and, of course...
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   That may inspire a whole generation.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   Yeah, they won't be.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   Like, we want with my three boys, and you can say what you want about the movie,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   it's entertaining.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   And at the end, they're like, "Oh, but you can create that in what?
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   Have you seen five years?
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   Or five seconds, if you're not.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   Right.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   No, you're right.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.280]   That's true.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   You're right.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   I talked a lot about the negatives of the movie,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   because I knew too much, and I knew that it was a lot of it.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   It was fictionalized, and I hated the way women were treated in the movie.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   But...
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   No.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   But it promotes entrepreneurship, right?
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   It did.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   The bottom line was that he with it, and this is what Larry Lessig said in his review of it in the New Republic.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   He said, "What the bottom line in this is, you don't need permission.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   You don't need Harvard's permission.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   You don't need the Internet's permission.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.280]   You just do it."
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   And that's a big change.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   Exactly.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   So I think that's the best you can teach him, you know, is to just do it.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.280]   And it's so easy these days.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   I'm actually trying to get them to learn to code iPhone apps.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   How old are they?
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   9, 13, and 15.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   But I failed so far completely.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.280]   Completely.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   But honestly, as an entrepreneur, I tried to hire iPhone developers here.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   Good luck, right?
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   Really?
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.280]   Oh.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   So expensive, $100,000.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   Because it's such a useful skill.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   They're very young, and they can make so much money by themselves with just having their own apps or coding for someone.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   That they don't, you know, they can't, you can't find any in terms of, you know, hiring a team of developers.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   That's the other side of all of this entrepreneurship is, yeah, we're creating a generation that wants its own business.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   But how do you find employees who are content to work for us allery?
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   Exactly.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   So maybe the solution is not to find people like that, but to find partners or to find contract employees.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   Well, it forces you to have them, you know, in the equity of a company with stock options or some equity.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   I think it's great.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   It's a great dynamic going on that everybody is an entrepreneur somehow.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   But yeah, if you are 15 years old, you can make quite a bit of money on the app store and all our, you know, market-based experience.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   What's interesting is...
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   Look at you, Lisa, you made a little packet on that camera plus.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   I did, yes.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   What's interesting is, there's been this sort of...
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   A lot of people are talking about how there aren't any women in tech.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   Why aren't there any women in tech?
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   And I mean, you don't see that.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   And I think it's just that confidence from a really early age and the focus.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   Because you know...
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   Do you think we can raise kids, girls today, so that that doesn't happen in the next generation?
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Well, I mean, I don't think that it's necessarily a really horrible thing that there aren't that many women in tech because it's just sort of an interest level.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   Okay.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   And I don't know, I mean, in watching what it takes to run a startup, I don't know many women who would want to dedicate it to the end.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   You know, 20 hours a day, no personal life.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   Right.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   You know, all those things.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   Truthfully, I don't know a lot of guys who want to do that either.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   I mean, we know them because they're all in Silicon Valley.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   But you go outside of this bubble that we're in, most people would say, "What are you nuts?"
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   I mean, as someone who's gone through the process of being kind of accepted into the tech community and I had a lot of problems getting into it because people are like, "Oh, you're just a girl, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   Right.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   I think that there's still a problem with one, like having the interest really early on.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   Right.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   Because it seems like, you know, if you're not--
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   What should the role of women be then in technology?
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   Um, the Booth Babes.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   Oh, come on.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   She's nailed it.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   What are you guys arguing about with it for you guys?
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Oh, the big defenders of the women's rights.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   These two guys.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   What a couple of phonies.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   Okay.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   You don't like Booth Babes?
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   I hate myself for liking Booth Babes.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   Oh, oh.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   Oh, that's different.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   Now I think--
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   Let's get into the psychology of that.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   I don't think so.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   I think we're seeing, you know, there are some women in high-powered positions.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   But--
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   But you know what happens though?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   Theres they're seen as domineering, bitches, controlling, unpleasant-- you look at Meg Whitman or Carly Fiorina and the hell they're getting in the political sphere.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   They're not treated-- or Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   They're not treated as the men would be treated.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   Oh, John, stop looking at me like that.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.280]   I'm just trying to make some-- hey here.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   [laughter]
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   You could draw you a line.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   [laughter]
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   You live with an entrepreneur.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   I couldn't live with-- I'm not an entrepreneur.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   I'm a small businessman.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   Oh, what is this?
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   I'm a small businessman.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   Getting smaller all the time.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.280]   [laughter]
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   Maybe the trick can be beside the point.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   I am a small businessman.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   Carol Bartz, there's an example of someone--
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   She cusses a lot.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   She cusses a lot?
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   Nobody says anything about Diane Feinstein or Barbara Box or who's an idiot.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   Okay, you're right.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   Nobody says bad things about her.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Maybe you're right.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   Yeah, well that's another thing that-- that-- in tech, if you're a girl with boobs--
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   What about a girl without boobs, a flat chest woman?
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   You're not as good a chance.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.280]   Well, she's the one who highlighted the boobs, not me.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.280]   Well, it's just-- it is easier for a woman like that to get in a position of--
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   As it were.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   Of power, but at the end--
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   I mean, what if I-- I was on the chat room a second.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.280]   You've been working with Adam Curry way too long, John.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.280]   There's another example.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   It's Marissa Meyer of Google.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   Now, there's an example of somebody who's treated with great respect.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   She's going to be at the web.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   Yeah, she got engaged at the web almost on stage.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.280]   Oh, that's true.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   So now we-- that's why we never change the dates of the web because Marissa's--
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   That's her anniversary.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   --very back every year.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   That's me.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   It's been three years.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.240]   But there's a very good example of somebody who has a huge impact at Google is a very important
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   person is treated, I think, respectfully.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   And she's attractive.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.240]   I mean, nobody's-- I mean, it's not like-- so there you go.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   There's maybe the exception that proves the rule.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   Yeah, it's just that--
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.240]   You should see the room when she shows up on stage.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Everybody's like, "Shut up.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   You're a silence, right?"
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   Well, she's Marissa Meyer.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   So I think it's actually great strength.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   I think it's great strength.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   --would get the same.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   It is a fuse it in the right way.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   And obviously, you know, there are a lot of--
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   I think it is a topic.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   I brought it up because--
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   I like the topic.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.240]   I think it's a fascinating topic.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   I don't mind the--
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   I'm just saying.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.240]   I didn't say it was bad.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   I just said, "How did we get on it?"
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   Well, you want to rewind for you and we can listen.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   No, I don't care.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   I just mentioned it just to keep people--
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.240]   I'm going to talk about something called fire sheep in just a bit.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   We also have some Google News.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   It's a big transitions at Google.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   It's the top story, the Netflix story.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   And we'll talk about the Netflix story.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   Absolutely.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   I thought that was very telling that Reed Hastings-- in fact,
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   I was shocked what Reed Hastings said.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.240]   Before we do, I'd like to remind you that you can--
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   back up your data with carbonite and not-- and sleep right tonight.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   Do you ever-- do you ever fear that your data might not be safe if you're backing it up
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   on a-- an external hard drive?
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   Hey, that's good.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   I'm glad you're doing it and I encourage you to keep doing that.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   But what if there were--
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   It happens there's a fire, the flood, or an earthquake,
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   and where somebody breaks in and happens to Francis Fort Coppola,
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   somebody broke into his house in Argentina, stole his computer.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   He'd been assiduously backing up all his scripts and notes to an external hard drive.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   They stole that, too.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   He said-- he was devastated.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   He said, "I lost 20 years of work because that was my only backup.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.240]   You've got to have an off-site backup.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   And you've got to have one that's automatic so that you don't have to remember."
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   That's where carbonite is so great.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.240]   Windows or Mac, you install it.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   You can do it right now.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   In fact, before I'm done talking, you can have it installed.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   Use the offer code "TwIT."
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   Two weeks free.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   Just the name "TwIT."
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   Once you install it, it's now immediately backing up.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   Whenever you're not using your computer, whenever you're online,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   it's trickling up your data to the internet.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   Once it's backed up, then you'll stay backed up.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   No matter-- you know, as you work, all your stuff is safe.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   You can access it.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   You could verify it by logging into your carbonite account from any computer,
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   or from an iPhone or an Apple-- they have a free iPhone app or a Blackberry app,
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   free Blackberry app, and see if your data is there.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   You can even download it.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   So it's always available to you.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   I love carbonite.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   I want you to try it free.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   Use "TwIT" as the coupon code.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   You could try it free if you decide to buy.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   Normally, it's $55 a year, which I think is a great deal for unlimited backup,
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.240]   all your personal data on your internal hard drive.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   If you use the offer code "TwIT," you'll save two months free.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   So it's a really good deal.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   Actually, my mom, who now watches this show every week, she told me, "Do you back up?"
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   You better.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   What?
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   But I will.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   Because every photographer, this is--
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   I have like three or four copies of every photo I've ever taken since 1990.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   I-- if you're a serious photographer, backup is like job one, isn't it?
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   I know.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   Well, I do on hard drives, but every time I move, it's, you know--
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.240]   Can I set you up with carbonite?
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   I'll call-- I'll call them for you.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   I'll-- I'll-- I will for sure use it.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   So let's go back to this original story that's set up, this commercial.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   Netflix.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   No.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   Co-Pola.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   Yeah, isn't that a story?
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   Is this a real story?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   What was he doing?
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   I thought he lived in the Napa Valley.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   Yeah, he has a winery, and he has--
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.240]   Yes, you know, there's the Francis Fort Gubble Museum.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   He has now up at his winery with like his Oscars and his--
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   But he has--
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   He was living in Argentina for quite a while.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   Why?
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   I hear Argentina's great.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   I'm going there in February.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   Hey, everybody says Argentina's the first place.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   It's the France of South America.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   Yeah, the Paris.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   Paris of South America.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   The Buenos Aires is the Paris.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   They have the Champs-O-A-Lizizio.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240]   So--
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   No?
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   I don't know.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   I'd love to go through that.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.240]   So the question is, is that he can't--
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   I'm going in February.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   I can't wait.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   He didn't have the same material backed up here in the Napa Valley.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.240]   He would have plugged it down there and--
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.240]   Really?
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   Yeah, that's what--
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   This is a true story.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   Yeah, I'll find-- if I can find the article, it happened last year.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   You know, that's a mistake.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:58.240]   He said 20 years worth of work lost.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   I mean, isn't that horrible?
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.240]   That's terrible.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.240]   I have a friend--
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   Well-known novelist, I won't say her name because I don't have permission to,
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   but she lived in the Oakland Hills, was writing a novel.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   She had a backup, local backup.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   Her house burned down in the Oakland Hills fire.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   Yeah, you know, Michael Rogers, that happened to him.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   The Newsweek writer, we also a novel--
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.240]   He lost the novel.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   Here's the irony of Michael's thing.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   He had his novel in a fireproof safe, but apparently a fireproof safe doesn't--
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   it doesn't protect against the firestorm temperatures.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   Right.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   So the thing was--
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   Melted.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   Melted, yeah.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   So you can't--
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   Thieves in Argentina, this was in 2007.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.240]   I'm looking at an article from BBC News.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   Thieves in Argentina have stolen a computer from US film director Francis IV couple,
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   which came to the script for his new production,
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   five armed robbers raided his house in Buenos Aires to computers and camera equipment.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   Hmm.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   And I don't know if I can find the quote on this article.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   Armed robbers?
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   So they came barreling in?
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   Wow.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   Isn't that horrible?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   So, well, Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man, classic story, right?
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   He wrote it-- he had written a second novel.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   It somehow got destroyed.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   Well, obviously it wasn't a computer error, but he never wrote another novel.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   Well, Carlisle had an entire novel thrown in the fire, but it's made.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240]   That's right.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   And he just said, "What happened to my manuscript?"
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   And she's all right.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   I think it's mine.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   And so he just wrote it again.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   It's probably better the second time, right?
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   It is always.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   If it's not devastating to you.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   And that's what happened to Ralph Ellison.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   I think he just-- he had no energy.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   He didn't write a lot of books.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   He just wrote one.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   The one is the killer.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   I mean, that--
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   One's good enough.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   If anybody wants to read a good novel, read the invisible--
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   If you write The Invisible Man, you probably could stop.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   And it's not about an invisible man.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   It's about an invisible--
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   It's a good story.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   It's not?
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   It's a piece of literature.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.240]   Claude Raines isn't--
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   No, Claude Raines is not in the thing and he doesn't disappear.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.440]   So the Netflix story, Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, is speaking to a Canadian newspaper
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   in Toronto.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.480]   And I guess he feels Americans probably don't read Canadian newspapers because he makes
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   an admission.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   He's not going to do this.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.880]   But they recently opened Netflix up in Canada.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.480]   I'm sure huge news, right?
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.040]   Canadians have been-- I know from-- we have a lot of Canadian listeners every time I talk
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.640]   about Netflix, I get pissed.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.360]   So they're charging $7.99 in Canada for something they charge.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.280]   I think it's $15 or $16 a year.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.280]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   It's half as much.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:38.120]   And the reporter for the Globe or whatever it is asks him, well, you know, how come--
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.560]   you know, aren't Americans going to be up in arms?
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.560]   He said, oh, you don't have to worry, Americans.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   Oh, right.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   Yeah, I remember.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.720]   They pay no attention to anything that happens in Canada.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   They'll never notice.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.280]   Well, now you notice, OK?
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.920]   Well, it isn't this too-- I mean, because it's taken so long for them to get there,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.920]   is this like kickbacks just to get--
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   Maybe he's feeling bad.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   Or Canadians on board.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.080]   I mean, we don't have Hulu, so give us a break.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.080]   We have Hulu.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.080]   Not such a great thing.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   I love Hulu.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   Do you?
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.040]   That's my two favorite things about being in America.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.080]   Hulu Plus, an Amazon product.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.600]   You like Hulu Plus?
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   Yes.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.960]   Now, Hulu Plus still has ads, right?
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.920]   Does it have more TV shows than Hulu?
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   It has like all the current episodes.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   I'm a member of Hulu.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.160]   Apparently, they're going to charge $4.95 instead of $10 for that, by the way.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.160]   They're going to cut that in half.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.160]   Thank goodness.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.680]   You think it's worth it?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.320]   I do, because I don't have a TV.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.600]   I don't have cable.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:40.080]   So if I want to watch any of the sort of trashy shows that I sometimes watch.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   You don't have-- nobody has to know.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   Nobody has to know.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.240]   You know, I made a big mistake.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.840]   And I admit this was a huge mistake.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.800]   I connected-- you know about blippy.com?
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   Yes.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:53.640]   It's a website where you connect your credit cards and Netflix and iTunes.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.680]   It's like a social-- it's like Twitter, but it tweets automatically whenever you buy
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.040]   or watch something.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.120]   So my Netflix streaming is on there.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   So it's embarrassing when you watch the Kardashian.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.160]   I mean, all movies have been streaming.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   Wow.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   Yeah, it's the Bond movies.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.160]   It's the Bond movies.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   That's what it is.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.320]   Yeah, it's a little insane.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.000]   So it does make everything like that.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Embarrassing.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Sometimes living in public could be embarrassing.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.120]   I did it with my last FM stream.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.960]   I censored-- like I would turn it off when I'd listen to like--
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.960]   Bad breath music.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.960]   What is it?
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   What is the music that embarrasses you to listen to?
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   But probably Britney Spears.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.960]   Whoa.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   Yo.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   Yo.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:34.840]   I liked when I clean my apartment, I like to listen to some happy tunes that--
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   you know?
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.680]   And then I'm right back to my ultra indie like cool songs.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   Uh-huh.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   So you only do this when Pete's not around.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   Well, he's not cleaning the apartment.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   I don't tell you that much.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   There you go.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   Not your renewers do not.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   It's hard to get a little battle.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   And have our take away your trip.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   Yes, go to the street.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   Can I make you feel like cleaning up a little bit?
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   You know, I just want to straighten up a lot of work.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   [SCREAMING]
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   Oh, she's--
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   [SCREAMING]
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   Oh, stop.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.080]   She got too excited.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.840]   Oh, we have a wine spill on the keyboard.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   Quick, pop the battery.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   Pop the battery.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   Pop the battery.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.680]   Can you pop the battery on that one?
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   Paper towels are coming.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   I can see.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   I just seem so light.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.680]   Paper towels are coming.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   Oh, man.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   I should never play the Britney Spears.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   She actually started dancing.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   I just need to do that.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   Wow.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   That'll be good.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.680]   You should drink wine, not spill wine.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.680]   Oh, this wine is--
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.680]   I don't believe that wine is covered by apple cream.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   Actually, so Jenna was googling you, and you've actually been a writer about wine.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680]   Yeah, I still like it.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   Oh, you didn't know that.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   This guy knows he's talking.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   But I know why.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.680]   I'm a wine collector actually.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   That's how he started.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   He just told me on Twitter to say what.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   And it's why you don't have to be sorry about it.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   Well, he was making some fairly derogatory comments about you.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   That's fine.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   That's what people should know.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.680]   He wasn't.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   I was just kidding.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   No, I collect more dough.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   Lisa, please.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   Lisa, please.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   I can't pop the--
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   What's your favorite, Baldo?
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   I'm going to--
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   I'm going to--
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   Please, let's have a--
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.680]   Would you please go ahead and have a little conversation?
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.680]   Hey, Eduardo, Margot.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   Margot?
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.680]   Oh.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.680]   Chateau Margot.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   But, you know, generally speaking, the weird thing about Chateau Margot is that some people--
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.400]   Oh, you like Margot, and they always do a showdown, typically with Margot and Latour, which are kind
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.920]   of interesting opposites, ones of masculine and ones of feminine wine.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   And I always prefer the Latour.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   Yeah?
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   Almost all the time.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.640]   And then when it really comes down to it, the wine I have most of is hobry own.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   So now, oh, hobry own is amazing.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.120]   Palmer is pretty good, too.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.520]   Now, tell me-- how do you-- no, you don't like Palmer?
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:33.920]   I love Palmer, but I've always found that-- I've always found that it's-- I've been up
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.800]   solo on Palmer in too many restaurants, and I've always disappointed because it's just
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   a long story.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.680]   And I've been to the Chateau, and I'm not as much of a fan as I could be.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.880]   I mean, I enjoy Palmer, but it's not--
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.880]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.880]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.640]   Yeah, it's OK.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.880]   You should come to Paris this year.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.720]   I'll organize that.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.960]   Why don't we bring him to the web?
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.400]   You can be my roomy.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.520]   Whoa!
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.680]   Are you starting again?
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.240]   Yeah, quick.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.880]   Get the wine away from me.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.320]   I would--
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.440]   Get the wine away.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.160]   Either get-- one or two things.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.440]   Take the wine away or the laptop away, but they can't have both.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.520]   And Lisa, you're now you're going to back up, aren't you, dear?
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.000]   Yes.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:25.520]   Yes.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.760]   Now she's been embarrassed.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.920]   She's humiliated by killing her.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.520]   No, she's not.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.480]   I don't blame her.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.200]   No, she's not.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   And we just kicked Lisa laptop out of chat
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.920]   so that you don't have to worry about it.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.520]   No, no, John, Jim or B won't take it over.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.520]   So why, you a shot to enough drinkers at the deal?
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.200]   No, no, no.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:44.120]   I just like a book I sell, and he's also a good friend, Perron.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:44.760]   Oh.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:45.960]   Well, that's different.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.560]   Loewick is well connected.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.560]   We have Gary Vee also on stage.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.800]   And to--
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.300]   What?
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:51.800]   Oh.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   Oh.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.300]   What?
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.640]   Gary, you don't have a friend here if you're Lisa.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.680]   We had-- we had--
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.000]   he's entertaining.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.880]   Gary is the Billy Mays of wine.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.160]   Is that wrong?
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.000]   Is that wrong to say that?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.680]   That sounds about right.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.000]   Yeah, that's what I thought you were thinking.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.360]   So Four Squares doing some interesting promotion,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.160]   actually speaking of Four Square.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.280]   Today, if you tweet from anywhere-- and in fact,
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.440]   I'd like to invite you all to tweet.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.280]   We could do a Halloween swarm.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.920]   If you tweet from anywhere and say,
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.600]   Happy Halloween, you'll get a Halloween badge.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   On Tuesday, if you tweet, I voted,
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.400]   you'll get an I voted badge, which I think
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.440]   is actually a very good use.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.880]   Yeah, I really love their sort of promoting healthy living.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.160]   And you can check in and get different.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.600]   I would probably exercise more if I had badges for everything.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.800]   Wouldn't that be good?
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.480]   I really would.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.960]   Yeah, I'm a gym rat.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.440]   I got the gym rat badge.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.800]   All you have to do--
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:48.480]   even I tried to work out for 45 minutes.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   I tried.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.280]   I chose that.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.200]   You should get a badge for that.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.960]   Why don't you actually work out for 45 minutes
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.440]   and get a badge for that?
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.080]   Yeah, but just like smaller--
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.040]   those running apps, it's embarrassing
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.000]   if you just run for one mile.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.400]   But sometimes that's where you've got to start.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.760]   I think they should one mile badge and be fine.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.680]   Louis, how far do you run every day?
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.640]   I know you're a runner.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.800]   Well, I'm running for New York Math on next week.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.680]   So he's a serious runner.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.400]   Don't you hate this guy?
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.880]   I've run 145 miles in October.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.080]   145 miles in October.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.600]   So like, 10 a day and like, maybe over the years.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.440]   That's amazing.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.520]   Well, I teach the first time in my life.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.520]   And I'm getting quite--
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.240]   I think I'm going to run to Seattle.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:30.880]   We'll see.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.960]   We'll chase you, John.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   I don't know if you'd like.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.360]   Would that help incent you?
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.200]   With Pitchforks.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.800]   Next topic.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.840]   Then he's probably a founder of Four Squares also running it.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.560]   I would guess that entrepreneurs are frequently runners.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.880]   It seems like those would be related kind of--
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.640]   Well, it's easy.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.320]   You travel.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.960]   You just need your shoes.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.360]   And it's going to be fun because we'll
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.640]   have those apps, you know, RunKeeper, which
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.440]   like streams your position knife.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.840]   So you'll be able to follow us during the marathon.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.920]   That's going to be speed live.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.200]   And so it's kind of cool.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.640]   If you're running, you can just travel with your shoes.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.480]   Do you ever get noticed these guys who golfers?
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.720]   They bring this huge bag of clubs wherever they go.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.760]   I've just unlocked the Halloween 2010 badge.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.360]   Oh, whatever.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.080]   But there's a Halloween swarm.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.160]   If you would all please check into Four Squares.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.760]   How about going to the Twitter and giving me some more numbers?
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   Going to the Twitter--
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.880]   The real Dvorak.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.760]   Did you actually call it the Twitter?
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.640]   The Twitter.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.600]   And the real Dvorak needs to tell the world followers.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.520]   OK.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.800]   Follow him on the Twitter, kids.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.280]   The Twitter.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.800]   Have you heard about Fire Sheep?
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.320]   This is it.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.480]   Yes, that is--
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.520]   A little scary.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.520]   We did a story on it, a show on it, entire show with Steve
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.440]   Gibson on security now if you want to know the technical
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:45.840]   details.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.600]   But I'll give you the short and sweet
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.760]   if I can figure it out a clean and easy way to say this.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.440]   Let me-- let's put it this way.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.920]   When you go on your web browser to a site like Facebook,
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.960]   the first time you go there, you log in.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.760]   But you don't want to have to log in every time
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.800]   you go to a new page on Facebook.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.200]   So Facebook to simplify this, and a lot of sites do.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.760]   It says, sends you a token, a cookie
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.080]   that is identifiable as you for this session.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.680]   Then from-- at every time you move pages on Facebook,
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.040]   that page says, all right, let me see the cookie.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.880]   It sees the token.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.640]   It says, OK, it's you.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.240]   And so you don't have to re-log in.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.080]   It's a nice convenience.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.160]   Here's the problem.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.240]   If somebody can get in the middle of that transaction
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.720]   and grab that cookie, then they can impersonate you
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.400]   for the period of time that session's going on.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.600]   This has been well known to hackers for a long time.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.800]   It requires ARP spoofing or a man in the middle of a tag.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.320]   It's a non-trivial attack.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.000]   Well, it was until Wednesday when a guy put out
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.680]   a Firefox extension called FireSheep.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.640]   Half a million people have downloaded FireSheep to date.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.040]   You can go to codebutler.com and get it for yourself.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.360]   I did.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.600]   I went to my local coffee shop, and it, without any additional
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   effort, without any additional trouble, grabs that token,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.320]   puts a list and a sidebar on your Firefox, showing you
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.560]   all the people in the open access spot.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.800]   You have to do this in an open access spot, who have logged in,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.760]   shows you their pictures so you can spot them.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.200]   Oh, who's that girl over there?
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:12.720]   What's she?
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.920]   Oh, she's on Facebook.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.440]   Then you double click it, and it gives you the token,
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.400]   and it just logs you right in.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.560]   You don't need a password or anything.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.600]   So I tried it with my friend.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.960]   I went to our local coffee shop, joined the open access spot.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.160]   I saw a list of all the people.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.400]   I said to my friend who was sitting there,
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.920]   so, OK, Vanessa, now-- because it's illegal to do this.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.600]   So I wanted to make sure I had permission of the coffee
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.920]   shop and permission of the person I was sitting next to.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.480]   Vanessa logged into Facebook.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.280]   She did.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:34.920]   She popped up.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.000]   I see her picture on my system.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Double clicked it.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.800]   I said, look, Vanessa, I'm logged into your system.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.040]   I can update your status.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.200]   I can change your picture.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.080]   I can see your friends.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.240]   I can get your phone number.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.520]   And it works with Twitter.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.000]   It works with Google, not Gmail, because that's HTTPS.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.360]   Yes.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.720]   But any non-secured--
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.360]   a huge list of them.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.480]   In fact, John, it's on there.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:54.840]   If you want to--
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.520]   Another reason not to use anything.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.480]   Well, there's two fixes.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.280]   And unfortunately, both of them are ugly.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.960]   Fix number one is what Google did, which is to--
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.800]   if you're Google and Google just put a post up yesterday
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.400]   to encourage people to do this, they turned on HTTPS--
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.640]   Yeah, do that.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.080]   Right now.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.000]   --all the time on.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.800]   And it's automatic now.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.240]   If you do it on Gmail, you're automatically always
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.120]   secured in Gmail.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   This is why they turn it on.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.200]   You can't turn it off, but don't.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.000]   And from then on, you're protected.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.160]   And this fire sheep won't work on you.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.360]   So Facebook has said, yeah, we're looking at it.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.160]   It's going to take us at least six months to roll this thing out.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.760]   As if they didn't know it was there.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.720]   Well, the thing is, it was never easy to do,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.640]   but it was always there.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.720]   But it was always there.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.480]   So it's them.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.560]   And the interesting question is the developer who actually
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.320]   made fire sheep what they're intention--
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.560]   Well, it's interesting because Steve Gibson was celebrating.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.640]   And no, he was celebrating.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.720]   He said, Eric Butler's his name.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.120]   He said, this is a good thing because it forces the issue.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.360]   This has been a problem all along,
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.240]   but it was so obscure.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.080]   Nobody felt pressure to fix it.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.840]   So Facebook and Twitter and everybody's
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.280]   going to have to turn on HTTPS.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.320]   Google posted a blog post this week saying, you know what?
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.680]   It was easy for us to do.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.840]   It has not used a considerable amount of resources.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.480]   In fact, far less than 1% of our server resources.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.200]   It's an easy thing to do.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.600]   Everybody should do it.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.960]   So we'll see if these sites do it.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.000]   The other thing to do is-- and you should encourage folks
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   who are listening.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.160]   You should encourage your Starbucks, your local coffee
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.520]   shop, your hotels who are using open access spots,
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.000]   just to turn on WPA encryption.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.920]   That fixes it.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.200]   Now, when you must travel a lot, do you
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:36.880]   feel wary of using hotel internet Wi-Fi in a hotel?
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.960]   Not really, honestly.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.040]   But this is scary.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.360]   You should be scared because anyone can get your--
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.040]   Yeah, if you log on to Twitter, they now
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.200]   have access to your Twitter account.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.000]   They could tweet Facebook and don't care.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.840]   Do you use Twitter?
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.360]   I do.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.280]   My name is the real Devorak.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.040]   Do you use the Twitter?
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.880]   I use the Twitter.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.400]   And I have been hacked, as you know.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.560]   We talked about that before.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.440]   I got recently hacked from my Gmail account.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.120]   I might add from some unknown source, in some reason.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.740]   And a whole bunch of friends of mine kept
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.560]   course, though I already knew this was bogus.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.200]   I'm in France right now.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.960]   I lost my password.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.600]   And all my money, please send me $1,000 so I could get home.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.400]   That's not a bad one.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.080]   I would actually do that.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.000]   I've gotten that one.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.040]   But well, where's my money?
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.640]   So anyway, the point is, is that it was just one of these.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.160]   So I'll click on here some bold, crap thing.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.840]   And I got like even Jim Warren sent me a note saying,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.480]   I know this isn't you.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.640]   And it was for my Gmail account I never used.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.800]   But I'd rather be hacked on the Twitter or the Facebook
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.280]   than lose Gmail, for sure.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.000]   Gmail, you're safe.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.400]   Although they can get into your Google account
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.040]   so they can see your Google web history.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:38.680]   They can--
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.120]   There's a lot they can do.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.480]   Yeah, but what do they want to do?
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.160]   They're going to go and look and say, well, this guy's dull.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.360]   Well, no, they can tweet for you.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.680]   They can change your picture.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.720]   How would you feel about that?
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.320]   Anything's an improvement.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:50.960]   Could have boobs.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.960]   Anyway, the other solution, as I said, turn on WPA2.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.120]   You get your coffee shop to do that.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.240]   I hope that this stimulates sites
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.520]   to start using HTTPS.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.160]   But get ready because already it's
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.720]   a problem on college campuses, as you might imagine,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.800]   because most colleges use open networks.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.000]   This is just another example of how the cloud sucks.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.920]   The cloud, it's internet websites.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.840]   It's not the cloud.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.480]   Are you saying the web sucks?
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.680]   No, the cloud in general.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.480]   That's what that drop-by-oh thing's all about.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.560]   It's cloud.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.800]   It's all clouds fault.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.440]   Cloud.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   It's the cloud.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.440]   It's the cloud.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.160]   To get off my cloud.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.080]   So we keep seeing rumors that Apple's
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.640]   going to have a white iPhone, but they just don't release it.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.720]   I had a good call on PC Magazine on this.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.960]   I have the explanation.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.600]   What?
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   Well, Steve didn't like the white.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.480]   Wasn't white enough.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.120]   It was white.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.400]   It was an eggshell white.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.240]   It was off white.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.280]   It was arctic white.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.480]   It was a titanium white.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.560]   It was any white, but he didn't like it.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.800]   I mean, what else could it be?
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   Steve is like a picky about these things.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.120]   I have another theory.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.480]   And I think my theory is correct.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.000]   Let's listen.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   He's not saying anything.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.480]   Yeah, it's the theory.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.000]   There we go.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.680]   No, stop.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.200]   Look, cut the music.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.880]   We made this promo for one reason,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.440]   to let you know that the white iPhone is on its way.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.640]   It's a little delayed, but it's not as bad as Dr.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.760]   Dre's detox album.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.800]   That's been on the books for six years.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.280]   And basically, we should revel in the fact
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.200]   that this is delayed, because a lot of things
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.680]   are better, a little delayed, and worth the wait,
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.520]   like the McRib.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.440]   Really?
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.320]   You can't release the white iPhone 4
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.880]   because of the camera?
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.680]   Are you kidding me?
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.960]   You released the white iPhone 3G.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.240]   You released the white iPhone 3GS.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.920]   And those both had cameras and were white.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.800]   And which camera are we talking about here?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.960]   Because there's fucking two.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.480]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.480]   You mean black with one time, and we're still waiting on white?
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.800]   You know, a lot of people don't realize
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.400]   this is the very first white product we've ever made.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.440]   We've never made a white Apple product before.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.480]   Ever.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.080]   You know what they say about iPhone 4?
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.600]   Once you go black, you never go back.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.800]   Because you don't have that option.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.120]   This has not been a good year for Apple and cameras.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.720]   First, they forget to put the camera in the iPad.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.720]   Then, they remove the camera from the iPod Nano.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.440]   And now they're saying they can't release the white iPhone
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.080]   because of the camera.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.760]   What's next?
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   The camera trapped those Chilean miners,
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.120]   took pictures of Brett Favre's [BLEEP]
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.520]   made that hooker, steal Charlie Sheen's wallet,
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.440]   insert any racist joke right here in your face.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.880]   Why don't you just buy the black iPhones, right?
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.960]   And besides, if you've waited for the white iPhone,
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.120]   you're an idiot.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.800]   You're a stupid human being who has waited five months
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.640]   for a phone that's a different color,
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.760]   that you're just going to put a cover on anyways.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.120]   So you're a fool.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.720]   In fact, why don't you go get an Evo or something,
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.760]   or a droid to?
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.080]   They apparently does.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.280]   You know, if iPhone 4 has taught us anything,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:34.800]   it's that you always, always bet on black.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.080]   I don't know who did this because this is very funny.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.360]   The Apple also was a white machine, by the way.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.920]   Consider this my formal recommendation.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.200]   Oh, no.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.400]   So was the white iMac.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.360]   So was the white Mac.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.240]   So was the white iPhone.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.080]   What?
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.120]   What?
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:46.720]   I'm telling you.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720]   Remember when they first came out of the party?
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   This is a parody, by the way.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.720]   This is a platinum white.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.640]   I just want to give credit.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.640]   This is O-O-J-L-E-O-O on Twitter.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.440]   And I don't know what it means, but thank you to the chatroom
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.680]   for sending that along.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.640]   It was off white.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.840]   Remember, they had the white iBooks,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.080]   and they had the problem because people would rest their hands
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.800]   on it and would turn yellow?
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.360]   Did you have-- you had one of those, didn't you?
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.080]   You had a yellow white iBook.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.360]   I just never used white again.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.560]   You had a white iBook?
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.360]   A lot of people did.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360]   Well, you have everything.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.240]   It's beside the point, whatever it is.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.080]   It still works.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.080]   We talk about it.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.280]   It still yellow.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.840]   I didn't quite get the yellow, but it broke off.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.040]   It fell apart, like most of these things.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.840]   I saw quite a few tweets yesterday
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.360]   when my friends who live in Long Island, New Jersey,
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.680]   and parts of Connecticut were finally
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.000]   able to watch the World Series.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Long Island.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.880]   Long Island.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.640]   Dr. Mom lives in Long Island.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.680]   Don't mock it.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.360]   Cable vision blinked.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.800]   And now Fox 5 and My 9 are back on cable vision after two weeks.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.600]   But still not on the dish network.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.680]   Yeah, that fight is still going on this because cable vision
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.720]   said it wanted more money.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.280]   And--
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:55.640]   No, no.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.520]   Fox wanted more money.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.800]   Fox wanted more money, and cable vision said no.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.200]   Well, Fox thought they had them by the nuts because they--
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.640]   It was a--
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.240]   They were hoping the Yankees were going to get in the World Series
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.720]   and they were going to get-- they had it made.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.320]   And then the Yankees couldn't even get past the playoffs.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.480]   You know, past Texas.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.480]   And the next thing you know, the Fox has no leverage.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.160]   So here's a statement from cable vision.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.200]   It says, quote, "In the absence of any meaningful action
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.680]   from the FCC, you know who you are."
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.040]   Cable-- no, I added that part.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.720]   Cable vision has agreed to pay Fox an unfair price
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.440]   for multiple channels of its program--
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.920]   A life, the objectivity of their company.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.520]   Including many in which our customers have little or no interest.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.840]   They were bitter.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.360]   The days are over for this whole system.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.760]   I hope so, because these guys--
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.720]   The cable crap, the blame them all, is just ridiculous.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.640]   The prices are way too high for everything.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.960]   Does anyone have Google TV?
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.200]   I'm trying to get 4D TV.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.400]   That's what I wanted.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.080]   Not 3D?
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.360]   You want 4D TV?
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.200]   That's C-- C band.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.280]   The big old giant 10-foot dish.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.360]   You want a 10-foot dish?
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.240]   I got a pad in the backyard.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.800]   I want to put a 10-foot dish up.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.680]   I want to get one of these 4--
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.160]   Apparently, speaking of dish has settled now.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.720]   When they saw when cable vision blinked, they settled as well.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.320]   Oh, well, good.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.920]   They didn't want to be the only one standing out in the cold.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.280]   Although, apparently, direct TV is dropping G4.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.160]   So there's some good stuff in the world.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.880]   There's some reasons to be happy.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.040]   So anyway, yeah, big, big 10-footer.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.640]   And then you have the all this gear, and they move it around,
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.200]   and you can catch all these feeds.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.640]   And you can get now 4D TV, referred specifically to HD,
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.920]   coming from the birds themselves.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.400]   And you had super high quality--
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.200]   I never heard of this.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.040]   4D TV.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.880]   Yeah, 4D TV on the 4D network.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.040]   That's cool.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.720]   4, the new black.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.960]   Go look it up 4.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.400]   4D TV.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.120]   Yeah, that's the high definition from the C-band.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.560]   I'm also going to become a ham.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.720]   I decided to--
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.160]   You already are.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:50.680]   Really?
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.080]   You're going to get a ham license?
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.880]   You don't have to learn Morse code anymore, though.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.360]   Right.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.400]   So I'm going to get a ham license.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.280]   I think it's the only way to go get a little generator
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.160]   in the backyard, because what's going to happen
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.680]   is that they're going to shut down the net.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.840]   They're going to shut down the TV.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.680]   That cell phones are going to be down.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.200]   And I'm going to be able to talk to people
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.400]   and be able to get out of town safely.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.560]   That's great.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.480]   In fact, John will still be doing his show on a ham
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.080]   when the rest of us are long gone.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:13.880]   Pack a radio.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.480]   We can still do the internet.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.920]   We can still do the internet with John's big 10-inch--
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.840]   10 foot.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.120]   We can still do the internet.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.600]   Well, I can have the 10 foot dish
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.480]   so I can get the broadcast from the satellites.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.640]   And then I can be a ham.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.960]   And I can talk to people.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.560]   When you are sitting here fretting
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.080]   because you've got no connection.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.360]   So yeah, I got the Google TV, the Logitech review.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.880]   I should have brought it in so we could play with it.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.520]   But I have to say, not so great, not so happy.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.040]   Why?
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.080]   Did you get one in a week?
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.840]   We had one in the office, actually, for two months.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.240]   Oh, you were an early beta test.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.720]   Well, we have an Android app.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.240]   Cismic is available on Android.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.600]   And we made sure that on a big screen it works.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.200]   So we've hidden it.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.880]   I do like the fact that I could use an Android phone
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   as my remote control with my TV.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   But come on, unnecessarily complicated.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.760]   It doesn't really add a lot of functionality,
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.800]   especially now that the networks are blocking web access.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.600]   That wasn't expected, I guess.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.720]   Yeah, well, that's this battle.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.040]   This is this cable vision fox thing in another form
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.160]   where the companies that could create this content
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.480]   are bitter about this whole thing.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.480]   They're going to block it.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:19.960]   It's a mess.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.800]   It's going to collapse.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   It's going to be a couple of collapsing.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.000]   It's all going to YouTube and live.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.920]   It's not tomorrow, but it's within an exciting--
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.640]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.560]   In the meantime, we're all going to suffer.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.000]   So I connected it up.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.520]   You take an HDMI cable from your cable box,
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.640]   you put it into the Google-- this is the Logitech reviews.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.400]   The one I had.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.800]   You put it into the Google TV box.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.320]   Then the Google TV box has HDMI out into your TV.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.920]   So it's kind of in between your cable box and your TV.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.720]   And it super imposes itself on there.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.240]   So you still have your cable guide.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.320]   You still have your TV.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.240]   You said it sucks.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.080]   It's like, why am I doing this?
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.480]   So first of all, the keyboard is your remote control.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.320]   It's a keyboard with a mouse.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.680]   And if you press the home button,
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.360]   the TV's kind of dims out and then you
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.960]   have a full screen of crap.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.360]   Like stuff you don't want.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.400]   Menu items-- and even the Netflix, which I do love,
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.240]   it's the old Netflix interface.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.240]   You can't subscribe to movies.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.560]   You can only-- it's read-only.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:20.400]   Instead, unlike the Roku box, which has the new Netflix,
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.600]   or even the Apple TV, which has the new Netflix,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.720]   it's the old Netflix.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.000]   But you'll remember Android sucked when they launched it first.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.080]   True.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.600]   So I actually would like to-- I think it's great that TV is
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.440]   becoming an open platform, back to platform.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.280]   I agree with you.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.960]   Because as a developer, not that I called myself,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.080]   but I have friends who code.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.960]   I would love to code myself.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.520]   You know, we can create apps for my TV.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.560]   But you want your kids to code?
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.280]   Yes.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.200]   I miss that part of my life completely.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.600]   You basically want to cut out the guys you're paying money to
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.160]   and you want free laborers.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   Exactly.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:51.660]   OK.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.680]   I've been trying for a long time to get my kids to be my employees
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.480]   for free, but I failed so far.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.640]   But anyway, you can-- so you can code an app for a TV.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.960]   I think it's pretty exciting.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.880]   I think that's exciting.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   Because--
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.440]   Well, that's why I was just--
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.480]   One of the Apple TV did not have apps.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.720]   I thought this is a real opportunity and they didn't do it.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.320]   So you can't-- so you're saying it's easy to code an app
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.520]   for the new Google TV because it's just an Android app.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.200]   You can have either web or web.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.440]   I didn't see the marketplace on this Google TV.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.320]   It's all very new.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.240]   Again, like Android was--
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.640]   I'm not working for Google.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.040]   But I think it's pretty cool that we can actually
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.120]   build stuff for a big time.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120]   And I agree with you.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.520]   And so yes, it's web-based.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.640]   And yes, Android apps run on it.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.200]   So down the road, this is going to be great.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.200]   Right now, get a Roku box.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.320]   And the concept of having finally an open box instead
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.000]   of having a whatever Comcast or something
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   box on your TVs is very--
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   Can I say something here?
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.520]   I just thought I'll do a bit off topic.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:48.520]   You're right.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.280]   This thing is extremely quick.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.000]   He's talking about the MacBook here.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:53.680]   And isn't it nice?
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.480]   I just accidentally loaded something.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:55.920]   And it goes boom.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.640]   Have to get-- yeah, boom.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.440]   Don't you love it?
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.720]   It's pretty amazingly quick.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.720]   It's very fun.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.440]   It's snappy.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.960]   After you play with the air for a little while--
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.000]   and now that Lisa's melted her laptop,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.880]   I think we're going to have to get you an air as well.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.120]   It's quicker than yours.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.560]   It's smoking as we speak.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.040]   I try to find Netflix, and they will always--
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.000]   I have a lot of--
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.480]   I bought half a dozen Netflix.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.200]   And why are we not surprised?
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.400]   Well, this is my job, John.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.200]   I have to review this stuff.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.280]   I'm not like you where they send me everything.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.360]   I have to go out and buy it.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.280]   I'm a normal human being.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.440]   You have so much--
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.480]   what does it call when you have a large audience?
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.280]   A big reach.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   You have reach, major reach.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   And the fact that you can't get this stuff for free--
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.040]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.600]   It's frightening.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.880]   No, it's because he doesn't try.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.480]   That's what it is.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   No, it's because I'm not print.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.720]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.600]   They are so primitive.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.960]   They don't understand what I'm doing.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.360]   This is wrong.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.920]   What it is, you're going through print channels,
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.160]   because we have people at MeVio, a couple of guys
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.520]   that do nothing but video stuff.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.240]   And they get stuff I can't even get.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.560]   Yeah, there's polluting the waters,
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.480]   because there's-- you know, logic--
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.320]   Well, we sent something to MeVio.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.680]   It's never traversing you getting pun-prevo.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.480]   I'm getting what?
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.040]   The palm.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040]   The palm, the pre.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.040]   You remember that, so please.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.400]   Maybe this is the reason you're not--
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.880]   I can get review units.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.320]   I choose not to, because I usually
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.240]   find it's a better experience to buy it.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.520]   So first of all, you feel the pain.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.320]   And you can also give it away to somebody--
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.600]   I can give it to somebody like you.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.000]   And then--
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.320]   I can use this thing, by the way.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.400]   No, you can't have that.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.360]   I'm keeping that.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   You're not getting that.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   Can I--
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.600]   No.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.040]   Well, maybe your Christmas gift.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.640]   We actually--
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.200]   Working on it.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.320]   Actually, we're going to-- now, we'll tell me, because--
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.000]   just don't tell the employees.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.800]   We were thinking of giving all the employees a MacBook
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.000]   Air as their Christmas gift.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.640]   But then my wife said, well, don't give--
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.840]   well, what if they don't want one?
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.520]   Just give them $1,000.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.040]   Don't give them any-- well, if cash is OK.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.240]   Yeah, because if you use cash, they could buy the air.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.080]   But--
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.360]   It's not really a thoughtful gift.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.720]   They're listening.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.960]   Stop listening.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.560]   It's a thoughtful gift is where you actually
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.520]   put more energy into it than give somebody
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.840]   a crappy gift certificate that they're going to lose.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.840]   We're sending-- actually, we are sending you a gift, John.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.640]   I can give it to you now.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.800]   You got a funny smile on your face.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.240]   So that's not going to be the MacBook Air.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.440]   That's what I'm angling for.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.200]   It's a Fez.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.920]   We're sending all the host Fez's.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.960]   I could use a Fez.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.800]   Let's see if you'll--
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.280]   I already look like crap in a Fez.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.800]   We've worn them before.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.240]   We already tried the Fez.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.600]   So we're getting 100-twit Fez's made.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.880]   You're saying a little turtle.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.160]   Very attractive.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:23.800]   Looking good.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.280]   Thank you.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:25.960]   Thank you very much.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.800]   1 billion YouTube subscriptions, according to the Google YouTube
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.000]   blog, 1 billion subscribers.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.080]   That is an amazing thing.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.720]   You have a YouTube channel, mostly Lisa.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:39.960]   Well, I--
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   You don't keep it up today?
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.560]   No.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.280]   I was a staunch Vimeo supporter until the very last minutes.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.040]   And I still prefer Vimeo because I'd rather--
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.800]   But all the people are on YouTube.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.280]   I know.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.840]   I'm not really interested in that angle.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.240]   I don't want to be a YouTuber.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.920]   I mean--
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.440]   You don't want to be--
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.040]   I don't want to be a YouTuber.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.200]   Is it because the comments are--
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.880]   When I look at our YouTube channel, boy, those comments are nasty.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.080]   Comments are mostly Spamor-nestia.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.720]   Yeah, I'm nasty.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:14.920]   I'll show you some.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.800]   I'll show you such a thing as nasty comments.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.840]   We have a very active YouTube channel, YouTube.com/trib.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.200]   I need to write this down.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.400]   You can watch.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.880]   You never heard of that.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.840]   It's the YouTube.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.600]   Maybe if I call it the YouTube.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.680]   The YouTube.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.440]   Now you know what I'm talking about.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.520]   If you go to YouTube.com/trib we have a very active channel
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.000]   with all the shows, including this show on it.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.920]   We put our specials on there and stuff.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   But then I go and I read the comments,
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.040]   and it's like, oh.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.320]   She looks good in a Fez.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.840]   You know the thing they do very well
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.640]   is reference the YouTube videos on Google, obviously.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.000]   Right.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.200]   So the way they--
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.040]   I mean, they're searched.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.160]   They're in the search index.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.360]   They go really high.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.800]   So that's why--
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.760]   That's another reason to be there.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:54.960]   Right.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.640]   So if you publish your videos only on our platforms
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.160]   and you don't do YouTube, then you're
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.920]   going to miss a lot of search traffic.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:07.240]   And we saw the Windows Phone 7 video we launched for seismic.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.640]   Got 50,000 views.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.320]   And that's a lot from searches, actually.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.000]   That's a lot.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:11.520]   That's interesting.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.000]   You could tell.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:12.520]   You could say.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.600]   So I should just ignore comments like--
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:17.360]   Oh god.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.040]   Twitch 7, do 71 sucked.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:20.520]   Of course.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.000]   It seems like no one in the panel has any--
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.500]   I'm not sure.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.320]   --on your own website.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.080]   It used to have--
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.320]   I should mention this to people who are newbies--
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.680]   in the olden days when Leo did the Twitch show,
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.120]   he used to have comments on the website.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.960]   What a mistake.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.120]   And they were actually quite interesting for a while,
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.920]   but obviously because this show is so huge
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.840]   that the moderators couldn't keep up.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   And so you got a lot of you sucked.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.200]   This show stings.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.400]   Dvorak stings.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.120]   Dvorak's great.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.240]   Why wasn't he on?
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.720]   It's like, what I can't win, because if I'm on, I suck.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.480]   And if I'm not on, the show sucks.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.640]   How does that work?
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.960]   So this trick or treat is roaming around the street
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.680]   back there already.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.800]   Hey, it's that time of the evening.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.840]   We probably should wrap up.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.200]   Do we have any candy?
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.440]   It's not yet another commercial to do.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.000]   Do we have any cocaine?
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.080]   Leo would never have done that in the olden days.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.240]   No, this is the new edgy Leo.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:05.840]   Yeah, the edgy--
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.040]   How do you like that?
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:07.520]   I enjoy it.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.040]   I can't like it.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.200]   I find it refreshing, because you do it.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.680]   You space it out just enough to make it acceptable.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.760]   Are you wearing a neck time?
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   You didn't notice this.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.560]   I just noticed.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.680]   Wait, this show's been going on.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.800]   How long did you start?
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.200]   It's an hour and a half ago.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.920]   You're wearing a neck tie?
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.000]   Yes, so I could have the giant's colors.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.640]   Oh, I get it, black and orange.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.040]   Did you see-- and this is the stupidest thing I ever saw.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:28.880]   I can't believe this thing.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.400]   No, I know.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.400]   I'm not paying attention.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.400]   Wow.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.200]   I just noticed.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.280]   There was in the newspaper today
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.000]   that people are putting pot in the Halloween candy.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   No.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   What?
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   Holy crap.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.320]   First of all, what pothead would waste pot on the decouette?
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:44.840]   I know, that's--
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.800]   Maybe they're trying to get people to vote for 19.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.800]   Oh, no.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.440]   That's where that story comes from,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.440]   is the anti-19.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.440]   Of course.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.000]   The anti-19 propagandists are all--
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.440]   We should tell people that California will be the first state--
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.640]   I don't know, maybe not the first state,
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   but we have on the initiative.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.440]   No, it will be the first state.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   It may well win on Tuesday.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.440]   I mean, just express my voice.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.440]   I think it's stupid.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   OK.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440]   Why?
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   I'll just explain what it is.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   It's a proposition to make it legal to own and sell marijuana.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.760]   No, actually, the selling part is-- yeah, it's legal,
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.160]   but you have to go through a licensing part.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.080]   It's not to be licensed, but it is legal.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   It's smoke and--
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.440]   You know, it's de facto legal here because we have medical--
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.440]   It's already legal.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   Marijuana, and it's very easy to get a medical card.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.160]   You can go to a medical marijuana place for anyone from out of state who wants to do this.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.680]   You go to a medical marijuana place, you wander in, and you say, "Hey, I got a cough."
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.560]   "Oh, OK, let me write you a prescription."
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.840]   There's a doctor sitting there for like 50 bucks or 100 bucks, whatever they charge.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   They just sit there.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840]   They do nothing else.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   They're a real doctor.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.440]   They sign a prescription, and then you walk across the aisle to the--
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.640]   But what the state doesn't like is they're not getting any tax revenue.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.800]   So they want to tax marijuana and help maybe in our deficit.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.120]   So you think it's a bad idea, Louis?
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.120]   Yeah, well, because I have kids, and they--
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.560]   We always want to offer $1,015, and I'm sorry, but this, you know, clearly helps the brain.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.160]   It's already gone over the place.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   I don't want--
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   What difference does it make?
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   Right, but--
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160]   No.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.160]   No.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   Which would rather have it regulated rather than just completely out of control.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   I really--
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160]   People can be re--
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.960]   No, I'm sorry, John, but I think if you make it difficult for people to buy--
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   It's not difficult.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   That's the joke of it.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   That's what we just said.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960]   It is an unfortunate article.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   Right.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960]   Anyone can get it, your kids are probably still--
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   No, I am so sympathetic because I have a 16-year-old--
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.560]   Well, I hope you're wrong about it.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.720]   I'm agreeing with you, Louis.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.520]   I think it really is, as a parent, it's a very concerning thing, and I don't know how
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.400]   I want to vote, because on the other hand, I don't want--
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   You're a liberal.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.640]   You're supposed to vote yes.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   Really?
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.840]   So it's the conservatives that are voting no?
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.000]   But they want the tax money.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.520]   Well, the smart ones are voting yes, but the typical classic conservative is voting no
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520]   because I don't know.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520]   I don't know.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.520]   I tell you the--
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.520]   Wait, isn't that--
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520]   It's a good word.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520]   It's a--
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   We don't need another--
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520]   What about nullification?
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]   State's rights, baby.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   I know.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520]   This would be great.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520]   That's why I want to see it pass.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.040]   Because the feds have already said, even if California legalizes the spot, we have not,
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.800]   and we will go after you.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   Right.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   So this is a perfect nullification.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800]   This will be great.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.800]   John's big proponent of this.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.400]   But you can go to Amsterdam right now, if you want to quick fix.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.400]   I don't want to--
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.400]   I'm not crazy.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.400]   I'm not crazy.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.040]   I'm not crazy about the idea.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.280]   I do think it's there anyway.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.440]   I mean, it's everywhere in the high school.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.440]   It's not everything.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   It's fair, but you don't want to make it easier.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   Any easier at all.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   Yeah, that's a little bit--
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440]   It's basically going span and on.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.560]   Okay, what's the Canadian experience?
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.960]   Because I know if I go to Vancouver, there's pot bars.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   Really?
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   You know that?
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   No.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   Just like Amsterdam.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   No, there's a bar in Vancouver where they sell you--
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960]   It's legal.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   It's quasi-quasitely.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:33.240]   Yeah, I mean, I grew up in high school and because I was an athlete, I never--
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.720]   You didn't use it all.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.480]   No, I mean, not alcohol.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.960]   Now you're in San Francisco.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.520]   You can change your ways.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:44.000]   No, I'm kind of compulsive about my--
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   Wow.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.800]   --how my body feels.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.920]   But I have to say that it being more legal has not made it more of a problem.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.400]   So that's an interesting example.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.120]   In fact, you might say because you don't have to imprison so many people for dealing
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   and smoking.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.120]   Anyway, here's a good example.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.720]   Portugal has decriminalized marijuana and the usage has gone down.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   It's been very well documented.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.760]   That's what's going to happen here, by the way.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.000]   The usage is actually going to go down because it's not going to be some forbidden fruit.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.280]   And by the way, somebody made a point that's not going to--
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   Or do you stop, John?
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.040]   Then why don't you go out like--
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040]   Well, you're talking to a liver.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.040]   --with the drugs.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   And you go ahead.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040]   You go ahead.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:41.960]   You go ahead.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   You go ahead.
