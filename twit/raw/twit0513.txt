[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.880]   We've got a preview of tomorrow's Big WWDC keynote.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.360]   What Apple may say, what Apple may not say.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.280]   We'll also talk about virtual reality, augmented reality,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.000]   and we'll learn a whole lot about the future.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.760]   It's coming up next on Twit.

[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.960]   It's time for Twit this week in tech to show where we cover the week's tech news with experts.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.880]   We can explain what it means to me.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.480]   Basically, I'm the idiot here.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.120]   We go ad very glad as always to have Jill Duffy joining us via Skype from where New York, right Jill?
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.880]   I'm in New York today. I'm in Washington, D.C. usually.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.640]   Oh, that's right. You've moved your base of operations to Washington.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.040]   Jill writes for PC Magazine.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   Somebody still writes for PC Magazine. I'm happy to say it's online at PCMag.com.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   We also have with us Steve Kovac.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.920]   Great to have you back. Normally, you move back east.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.320]   Yeah, I'm usually skyping in from New York like Jill, but I've got to come out.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.120]   You're out here for the Mac event, the Apple event.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.640]   I'm here for Apple and some other cool meetings out here.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   Steve's senior editor for Business Insider.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.280]   Actually, you're senior editor for SAI, which is the tech section.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.640]   What's that stand for?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.160]   It's Silicon Alley Insider.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.120]   So, BI first started back in '07.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   That was Callie Canis' publication.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.840]   No, no, I'm not a blodget.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.000]   And an old friend is here. Not really a tech journalist, but a guy who certainly knows a lot about
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760]   what's going on in technology, Greg Panos. Nice to see you.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.840]   I've told the story many times about running into you at CES a few years ago.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   And you said, "You know, we could do DevNol, the virtual reality character I used to inhabit
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.160]   on the site in the mid-90s. We could do that on a PC today."
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.480]   You could do it on the smartphone app that's working on the phone.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   So, Intel Pocket Avatar.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.680]   Isn't that hysterical?
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.640]   Yeah, we bought a half million dollar Silicon graphics onyx.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.160]   Right. Reality engine.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.640]   Yeah. And the protozoa made the character.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, Brad, do graphs, companies.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.240]   And somebody, I think I met Brad in the men's room.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.880]   Some at Oinor was, it was at the Webbies.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.440]   He said, "You know, I still have Dev on a hard drive somewhere."
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.400]   So, that character could come back, ladies and gentlemen, on a smartphone.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.960]   Yeah, well, we called it performance animation.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.680]   And it was really hard to get people in the industry to adopt it,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   because a lot of vendors were trying to sell motion capture hardware.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.840]   So, they would always refer to as motion capture, which is really not a live performance.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.480]   You perform live, and then it's recorded and tweaked.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.240]   But performance animation, you set it up, and then you just perform,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.640]   and the character is performed and animated live.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.240]   It was a real-time virtual.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.960]   Yeah, real-time.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.640]   It's a lot harder to do.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.240]   That's why MSNBC wanted it, is because Soledad O'Brien could sit at the coffee bar,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   which was real.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.640]   She was real, as far as I know.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.000]   And she would sit at the coffee bar, stare at a dot.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.600]   But on, and she would talk to, she could hear me, she had hit an earpiece in.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   So, I'd talk to her.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.360]   But instead of seeing the dot, the viewers at home would see
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.080]   a virtual character's, that know, animate.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.560]   There he is.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.960]   The most annoying.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.160]   Easy, awkward TV.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.040]   That is good.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.680]   I take credit for it being annoying.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   And the technology was a little primitive.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.920]   But it worked.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.480]   Yeah, it did work.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.840]   And the thing is, it worked in real time.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.360]   So, you didn't have to go back and spend days, weeks, months, years animating.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.600]   Dev Knoll.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   Right.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.120]   There were a couple of companies that were really
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.040]   ruled the roost in that whole area.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   But it's so ugly.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.720]   But do you think nowadays you could make it look more realistic?
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   Yeah, there's, I don't know if you've seen Baby X, but that's a research project
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.360]   that Mark Sagar has been doing in New Zealand with the University of Auckland.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.920]   And it's creepy as hell.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.200]   I mean, talk about Uncanny Vow.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.480]   Digitize his daughter, and then they built a complete brain model of a child.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   And it reacts and responds with a webcam.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   It can listen to you, can recognize characters or photographs of animals.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.920]   And it's really cute.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.520]   I mean, a little baby animation is all done in real time.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.840]   It's all run by a virtual AI brain model.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.960]   So it learns.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.920]   He's smart though, because one of the problems with AIs is they aren't adult humans.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.120]   But a baby, you might be able to impersonate a baby in a small child.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.240]   Oh, it's very effective.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.520]   There's a couple of YouTube's out there showing Baby X with him interacting
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   with the virtual baby.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.600]   And it's just mind-blowing.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.840]   It's just, it is a little bit of the Uncanny.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.360]   So they're up to 3.0 now.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   The baby was scanned using like a Kinect when she was asleep.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.120]   So she looks pretty good.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.800]   And then the performance is all driven in real time.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.320]   Is that her voice?
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.440]   It has a voice model in there as well.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.240]   So she's saying dad dad?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.240]   And if he stares at the camera and starts smiling and saying hi and paying attention,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.440]   then she'll start smiling.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.160]   It's so creepy.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   That's really creepy.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.480]   So creeped out right now.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.360]   It's just the beginning.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.920]   I mean, you're a real-time...
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.400]   Well, I know.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.760]   I call... they use the word "Avatar" to describe a virtual character.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.680]   But it's a very generalized term.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.360]   And I created a term years ago called "Persona Form"
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   which is one that's supposed to be very, very photorealistic of an individual.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.320]   And this would be a construct that you digitize yourself throughout your lifetime
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   and you add it to one unified database and then you leave it behind.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.200]   When you die, you can exist.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.760]   Right.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.800]   There'll be a platform that will be able to run one of these constructs
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.760]   and it'll be able to be a virtual storytelling machine of you in your life.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.400]   We should talk because what I'd like to do is after I die,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.120]   Twit could continue because frankly, if you digitize a few hours of Twit, you got it.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.080]   They got the whole thing.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.640]   That's right.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.600]   Of me going, what?
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.000]   No.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.720]   Really?
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   And then you just... we're gonna host other hosts, co-hosts.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.120]   So yeah, some of the other animation...
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   Some of the other animation...
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.440]   You can play Pong?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   Yeah, it shows the brain model working and all the various factors of...
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.800]   Oh, smile is so...
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.840]   It is so chucky.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.560]   Very complex.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.800]   I mean, this is like... I guess you can practice being a parent
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.480]   before you're actually a parent.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.080]   But what the goal really would be to have
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.960]   artificial intelligences that appear to us like humans.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.520]   Right.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.640]   Yeah, well that was...
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.480]   Why not make it not human?
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.960]   Why not make it like a nice little round, you know, a ball or something?
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.480]   Because the human is what's creepy.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.720]   Yeah, until you get past a certain perception...
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.000]   So you get really good at it.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.080]   We have a lot of circuitry in our evolution and recognizing faces
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.520]   and we notice when things are wrong.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.160]   Right.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   And then they call that the Uncanny Valley.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.880]   Right.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.480]   So there's like...
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.840]   I was a consultant for the Casablanca elite modeling agency a long time ago
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.600]   when they started digitizing Giselle Bunchan and...
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.000]   Trying to be a realism consultant, you know.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.160]   See, I thought Giselle was fake for years.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.440]   So that's...
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.520]   She's actually been an avatar all the time, yeah.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   Here's no.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   But they obviously, if you're in modeling agency,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   you would love to can these models.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.640]   Right. Well, Michael Crichton wrote a movie about it called Looker.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:16.960]   Right.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.600]   Back in the 70s where they digitized the models.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.920]   But of course they would kill them afterwards.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.200]   So they didn't have to pay them.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.920]   It was a thriller.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.640]   That's a thriller.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.320]   You wouldn't have to be killed, you just retire.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.800]   Yeah, well they retired them, bang bang.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.480]   Now movie.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.040]   So this is autonomous, which is what's interesting about this.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   This is not capture like they did with Rise of the Planet of the Apes or Gollum.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.600]   It's not Andy Serkis with a camera in front of his face.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.400]   These are completely...
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.640]   You'd write, they actually structure the bone models
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.480]   and set up all the rigging in advance.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.160]   And then they have a facial animation coding system,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.760]   which drives the model.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   And then the AI drives the facial coding system.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.800]   So its behavior is aligned much more with a perceptual sense of what's going on in the real world.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.920]   And then the animation is driven by the typical rules that
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.720]   normally apply to our own bone structure and face.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Very interesting and also very creepy.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   Anyway Greg, we're going to talk more about VR because this is obviously one of the big stories
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.040]   that's been going on ever since Google I/O and cardboard.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.680]   I just got my Galaxy Gear VR.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.360]   I had an amazing VR experience I'll tell you a little bit about.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.040]   And we'll talk more about what Oculus is doing because the rift now with all that Mark Zuckerberg
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.160]   money behind it, they're obviously going to make some big steps.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480]   But the big story I think as we convene on Sunday is tomorrow,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.840]   that's when Apple's WWDC happens.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.320]   And we expect many, as always, great things of Apple.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.440]   The question is, what will they deliver?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.520]   They've already, I think they already sent up a little signal balloon.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.320]   The New York Times reported unnamed sources said, "Don't count on a new Apple TV."
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.560]   Yeah, that sounds like the last second they kind of pulled the plug on that thing and they wanted to
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.080]   manage expectations a little bit.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.560]   So it leaked out that there's no TV box.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.880]   Is that the no TV news at all actually?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   Is that the sense that you get is that when Apple wants to do something like that,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.200]   they call the Wall Street Journaler the New York Times and say, "Don't quote me."
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.400]   Certainly feels that way, doesn't it?
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.840]   Don't say that I said it, but we want to let the world know there's not going to be an Apple TV.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.040]   That's a big disappointment.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.280]   What hell, why is there not going to be an Apple TV?
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.320]   Well, I've heard this.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.080]   I mean, I've talked to people at Apple before who have told me they've literally pulled the
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.400]   plug on projects a week before they plan it on.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   That's how it happens all the time.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.200]   Sometimes you'll even be watching a keynote and you'll feel like there was a chunk business.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.920]   Right, exactly.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.560]   They just jumped.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   And we might see that tomorrow because I mean, as of three or four weeks ago,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760]   the plan was still to show this thing.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.200]   So it's not a hard, they have hardware.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:53.840]   They have hardware.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.000]   Well, thank you for the software and the streaming service that we've been hearing so much about.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.240]   Right.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.080]   That has been hanging it up.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.320]   If you look at the WWDC invitation, that's got to be an Apple TV.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.520]   Or it's an app icon.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.920]   Like I said, everyone is like, oh, it's an Apple TV.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   No, it's a looks like an app icon to me.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.720]   Do you think that thing?
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.200]   That's an Apple icon.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.160]   Yeah, the thing in the middle.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.640]   The middle.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.920]   Oh, let me close this.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.800]   The middle.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.600]   That's an Apple TV, that black thing or an app icon.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.520]   It is a developers conference after all.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.480]   It's an Apple TV.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.560]   Okay, Jill, what do you think?
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   App icon, Apple TV in the middle there.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.920]   That's pretty square for a TV, isn't it?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.960]   No, but no, it's the rounded...
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.080]   Right, I should have brought my Apple TV in.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.720]   Yeah, it looks like an Apple TV.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.160]   Well, when you're saying Apple TV, are you talking about the streaming device?
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.440]   Yeah, not the television set.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.280]   A television set that may be...
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   No, no.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.120]   Okay, because it's not bad.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.760]   Nobody thinks Apple's making a television set anymore.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.160]   Well, it's...
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.400]   No.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.440]   And it would be 4-3.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.640]   It would be a very bad TV.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.320]   No, actually it would be 4-4.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.440]   It's a square.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.320]   So you're right in that.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.400]   No, I'm talking about the streaming box, right?
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.120]   And one of the reasons we're pretty sure that that's going to be soon is that
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.920]   the Apple's been rolling out these HomeKit things, new devices.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.520]   They need a hub.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.920]   They need an interconnected hub that is also connected to the internet
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.400]   so that you can control it from work.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.880]   Right.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.000]   And they don't have that yet.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.400]   They have the phone, they have the bits and pieces.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.360]   We just saw...
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.400]   Look, what was it?
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.640]   The light company, Lutek.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.880]   There's some light switches and things like that.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.520]   The cassette.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   From Lutron, the cassette.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.360]   But that...
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.520]   So that, you have the way that works,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.120]   according to...
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.720]   People have had it already.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.120]   Have it.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.360]   I think Serenity Caldwell had one.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.600]   She demonstrated for us on Mac Break Weekly on Tuesday.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.320]   She named her lamp Space Shuttle.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.720]   And she could say, "Hey, Siri, turn on the Space Shuttle."
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.160]   And the lamp came on.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.280]   And that was connected to a Lutron Power Plug,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.880]   or maybe it was a Lutron Light.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.400]   And to set it up, she had the Lutron app on her iPhone.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.880]   But she could use HomeKit eventually.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.200]   The idea would be, I guess HomeKit would control everything.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.480]   But you still need something that is internet connected in the house
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.920]   that also talks to everything.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.640]   Right. And it's going to work with the current gen Apple TV.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.120]   There's already...
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.600]   You think so?
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.080]   I know so.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.160]   There's already documentation out there on Apple's developer pages for HomeKit
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   that say it will work with the Apple TV 3 and higher.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.880]   So you don't need to go out and get a new Apple TV.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.040]   If you have the most recent Apple TV, you're fine.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.760]   So that blows me out of the water.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.280]   Because I thought, well, they have to...
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.800]   If they're announcing all this HomeKit stuff,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.240]   as I'm sure they will tomorrow,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.000]   they've got to have an Apple TV to control it.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.680]   But you don't think they needed Apple TV 4.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.800]   They can use the Apple TV 3.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.120]   Correct.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.000]   So it really is about the new offerings on an Apple TV that they've stalled.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.120]   Yeah, it's going to be...
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.960]   I mean, the big stall seems to be that over the top streaming service.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   That's kind of like Slain TV and this other one,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.880]   PlayStation View and so forth.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.320]   It seems to be holding it back.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.120]   Rumors were they were actually talking to local stations.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.440]   Right.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.240]   So that if you're in Chicago, you'd get the WGN,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.600]   you'd get the local stations.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.400]   And then also to networks.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.920]   NBC said we're not going to do it,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.680]   but CBS and ABC said they would.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.200]   Yeah, Les Moonves got on stage at the Code Conference two weeks ago or whatever.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.120]   He said he was public about...
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.720]   We're talking to Apple about this thing.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.000]   I'm sure he violated some NDAs doing that,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   but he doesn't care.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.760]   It's funny because Apple just must be struggling with...
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.720]   Because similarly, a Sony music CEO just yesterday confirmed
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.360]   that Apple's going to launch a music streaming service.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.880]   This must be so hard for them.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.400]   Well, it just shows you who has the leverage here.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.240]   The content owners and the content creators, Apple doesn't have the leverage.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.000]   They can be quiet about it,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.960]   but these guys have all the leverage in these negotiations.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.000]   They own all the streaming content that we're going to want to consume through
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.720]   Apple service.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.560]   So they can say whatever they want.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   Apple can't complain.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.160]   Doug Morris is the CEO of Sony Music.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.040]   He was speaking in Cannes at the MITOM Music Industry Festival.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.920]   And he said Apple will announce its new music streaming service tomorrow at WWDC.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's happening tomorrow.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.720]   Morris said.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.240]   All right.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.880]   Well, there you go.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.840]   What does Apple bring to this?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.920]   Morris said, well, they've got $178 billion in the bank,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   and they have 800 million credit cards and iTunes.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.840]   Spotify has never really advertised because it's never been profitable.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.400]   My guess is Apple will promote this like crazy.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.040]   And I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming business.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.320]   He's very bullish.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   A rising tide will lift all boats.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.000]   And find that music executives like to...
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.600]   Well, he has to be bullish on it, doesn't he?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.200]   No one's buying CDs.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.960]   Digital music sales are flat.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.400]   They need a streaming service that goes mainstream.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.840]   It's not just going to help Apple.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.080]   It's the tipping point for all streaming service.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.640]   Right.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.280]   Spotify's the dominant service at this point.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.400]   Jill, you obviously, you're a runner.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.040]   You talk about the exercise bands.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.960]   You must listen to music while you run?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.360]   No, I listen to podcasts.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.240]   Smart woman.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.880]   There you go.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.400]   I like you even more.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.200]   Yeah, no, but I know Spotify has a new feature now called Spotify Running.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.000]   I think it's for premium members only, and you can turn on
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.240]   a streaming music that will match the beat of your cadence as you're running.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.120]   So I've seen a couple other apps that do the same thing,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   but now Spotify is going to try to do it too.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.640]   And I would actually argue with you that Spotify is one of the big leaders,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.440]   but Pandora is very often overlooked still in the US in particular.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.200]   They're a very strong company.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.400]   I talked to some of the executives.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   They're not too long ago, and they have quietly had a huge chunk of the streaming music,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.120]   pocketbook for a long time.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.000]   They have very dedicated loyal users.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.160]   They do a good job with their advertising.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.120]   So I think it's still a very competitive space,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.320]   and it kind of speaks to Apple's strength in that it likes to look at markets,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.880]   see what's working, see what's not working, and take its time before it rolls out of products.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.400]   So I think Apple's kind of primed right now to roll out some streaming music,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.800]   but let's not forget that that landscape is actually pretty competitive right now.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.840]   It's very competitive.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.920]   I have to confess I have a little bit of a dog in the hunt because Spotify,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.120]   when they announced podcasts, we were one of the partners they launched with.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.160]   You guys are all over it.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.720]   I noticed that.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.840]   It's very happy to see Daniel extending next to our logo.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:32.080]   But we're excited because that's 60 million people who can listen or watch,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.800]   because Spotify added video, which I thought was very interesting.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   Turns out video on mobile is huge that I would never have thought,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.760]   and certainly I never watch.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.520]   Well, maybe in a minute I'm bad I might watch a little YouTube or something,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.040]   because it's tied to an article, but I would generally prefer not to watch a video on it.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.760]   It's kids.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.400]   It's kids.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.600]   So sticking my life today.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.680]   Well, we're not going to benefit from that.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.200]   Music and see without glasses.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.920]   That's why I like the gear VR.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.400]   It's right on your face.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   It's right on your face.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.200]   It's a fluid to my forehead, and I can see everything.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   Doesn't the music industry hate Pandora, Jill?
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.080]   I mean, they would love to put Tim Westergren and company out of business.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:17.280]   I think the music industry needs to figure out that it needs to love Pandora and Spotify and Apple.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.240]   The music industry isn't its own thing anymore.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.280]   It really needs to work with other partners to be successful.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.760]   The people who I think are still grumpiest are the artists themselves.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.640]   So that's a place where Apple might actually have some innovation.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.240]   If they can make, if they can make Bono from you too, super happy.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.800]   Maybe they can have good relationships with other artists and make them happy,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.560]   because they're the ones who are still complaining.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.520]   They're not getting a good decent chunk of money
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.320]   from these streaming services, the way that they did
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.200]   when CD sales were higher, when they would have bigger margins on their concert touring,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.920]   and things like that.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.960]   I feel like it's somebody's getting money.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.840]   I mean, Tim always says we pay billions of dollars to the music industry every year.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.880]   Somebody's getting money, and if an artist is not getting it,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.480]   it sounds like the label's just keeping it.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.040]   Just keep it.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.080]   Just keep it.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.320]   Don't get mad at the streaming music services.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.840]   Get mad at your label.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.520]   Make a better deal next time around.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.400]   It's only the superstars, the Taylor Swift, the Drake's,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.480]   you know, all the Beyonce's who have that leverage with the label.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.440]   It's the little guys don't.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.320]   And they're saying, and I understand it, I believe it.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.120]   You could pay a million times and I get 50 cents.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.680]   It's not going to make me rich.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.920]   It is. You think it might.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.240]   Oh, we're losing you.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.920]   We're going to re-plug your headset in there, Jill.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.960]   He's turned into a robot.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.840]   She's a robot.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.560]   She's turning into one of the Greg Panos' creations.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.320]   Yeah, Jill, a music industry.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.680]   A plug and re-plug your headset.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.720]   Very, very greedy.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.240]   I grew up in New York back in the '80s, and I knew a lot of big, big record executives
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.840]   and people in the music industry.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.640]   They used to go to Studio 54 all the time and hang out with them.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.760]   And they were so greedy, there was so much money rolling in all the time.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.280]   They were not ready for the future.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.560]   When the future happened, they immediately took a financial hit.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.440]   So rather than study and learn and adopt and adapt,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.680]   they wanted to throw a steam roller over everything and get in the way.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:23.440]   And so, to this day, that sort of lack of compliance with the movement towards the future
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.360]   has been bad for them.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.320]   And soon they're DM-A.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.520]   Still behaving badly like spoiled children.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   Corey Doctorow, he said, "They'll never go back to the day of the $17.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.280]   Is that going to happen?"
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.440]   That gets scratched and you go buy another one.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.400]   I remember when CDs were just happening, everyone was so upset and so livid that
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.840]   the potential for copying them could actually take place,
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.480]   or that they sounded better or they would last longer.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:55.280]   Corey Doctorow always said, the whole point of view of the current music executives is,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.640]   "Look, I know this is going to happen.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.080]   I just don't want to happen on my watch.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.920]   I'm going to hold the fort until I retire and then some kid can suffer the consequences."
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.880]   Well, guess what?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.080]   Here we are.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.440]   It's almost 20 years into the digital revolution.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.480]   I first heard about MP3s in 1994.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.840]   I think it's time to kind of figure it out.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.400]   Corey Doctorow, he said, "Was it a famous line from the movie about Facebook that Justin Timberlake
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.280]   said? Have you been into a Tower Records lately?"
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.520]   Can you find a Tower Records?
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.920]   The Tower Records in San Francisco used to be the greatest
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.520]   record store in the world.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.720]   It's a dry cleaner.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.800]   It's a dry cleaner now.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:43.360]   In Tokyo, they're opening record stores, apparently, says Chris.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.080]   Is Jill better? Is Jill all better?
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.160]   All right, sorry about that, Jill.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.240]   My problem.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.480]   No, it's some magic thing we know that there's a chip that has a problem in it.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.280]   Virtual frog?
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.040]   Yeah, it gets to be plugged in.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.640]   That happened to me when I was on a few weeks ago.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.680]   Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:22:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.840]   I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.880]   Do you remember?
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.760]   I was just saying that Taylor Swift, I think Greg pointed out,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.440]   she actually was one of the people who pulled from Spotify because she said,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.720]   "This is not worth it for me."
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.800]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.680]   If you're Taylor Swift, you can do that.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.640]   1989 sold very well.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.240]   People actually bought the album.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.320]   But that's Taylor Swift.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.640]   I have to think that other artists who want to be discovered need to embrace streaming music.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.880]   I mean, we've had this debate before.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.560]   But if it can't work for Taylor Swift financially,
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.520]   how is it going to work for anybody else financially?
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.000]   That's true.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.880]   But what if, OK, so you're an unknown band and you just made your first album.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.280]   What do you do?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.720]   You can't depend on the record company to push it on the radio stations.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.960]   They don't, who even listens to radio anymore?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.920]   YouTube Spotify.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.760]   Spotify would love to be your record label.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.720]   They would love that.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.160]   If you do get picked on there, you would get a bigger slice of it.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.040]   What about the regular?
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.160]   Jay-Z's title?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.880]   Because that's the pitch Jay-Z's making to his buddies.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.440]   Well, that's that.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.480]   It's exclusive and higher quality.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.600]   You're going to get the first release of the new album here.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.720]   You can see Nicki Minaj and Beyonce's new video before anyone else.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.080]   It's $15 a month.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.120]   It's going to fail.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.680]   It's going to fail.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:15.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.480]   It's not going to happen.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.120]   It doesn't have a prayer.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.840]   Apple, unfortunately, won't be able to come in under $10.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.360]   They had hoped, I think, to get it cheaper.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.880]   And no free tier, either.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.840]   No free.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.600]   But that's their pitch, isn't it?
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   Apple's been saying to the,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.920]   look, Apple's got to do something to say,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.080]   we're better than Spotify title Pandora.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.280]   So how do they do that?
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.160]   They say no free, right?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   And we'll give you more.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.200]   You know what?
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.960]   I wouldn't be surprised if come September,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.680]   when new devices are actually rolling out,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.440]   some people who buy new devices get, say, a month free.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   Because Apple's done that kind of thing before, right?
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.760]   So they roll out a new version of their office suite.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   And they'll say everybody who buys the newest version
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.800]   gets it for free.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.480]   Everybody else has got to pay for it.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.080]   Free for ever?
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.040]   No, just free for a little.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.760]   A month or something.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.880]   For a month, yeah.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   But I think there will be some,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.680]   there will be some way for people to try it out
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   before they have to shawl out some money.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.240]   Oh, well, I mean, that's how all of these guys work.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.400]   You can get a free month on any of the services right now.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.040]   Just sign up.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.160]   I wonder if Apple might, and by the way,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.720]   this is their repurposed version of Beats, right?
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.720]   We don't know how much repurposed.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.000]   We don't know if it'll have many of the beats.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.200]   You know, Beats has some nice features.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.160]   You build a sentence.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.920]   You know, I want to dance at Studio 54
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.360]   with
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.680]   Weezer wearing, I don't know, glitter shorts.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.640]   I don't know.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.000]   I can't remember what the sentences are.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.240]   Roller with roller with roller with roller.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.520]   And then you get music that would presumably match that crazy sentence.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.400]   I am because they're going to,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.800]   I think they got to roll out of the Android as well as iOS, right?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.920]   It sounds like they're going to do that too.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.520]   You would not want to roll out on the Android.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.960]   They'd leave out half the universe.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   It's going to be like bringing iTunes to Windows for the first time.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   Which was controversial at Apple.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.480]   Is it going to, it's going to be 10 bucks.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.240]   I wouldn't be surprised to see them announce it tomorrow and say
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.960]   it's launching in a week or maybe even tomorrow.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.920]   We don't know.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.120]   And although apparently they're still making deals up to the last minute.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.320]   So it may not be ready to go.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   And three months, I'm going to, I'm going to Trump you Jill.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.360]   Three months free.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.120]   How about that?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.160]   90 days free.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.160]   How about if you buy an iPhone, a year free,
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.840]   an Apple would have to subsidize that, right?
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.040]   But I think what's more important, think of this iPhone 6S or 7
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.200]   or whatever it is comes out this fall.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.040]   50 million people buy them at the Christmas quarter.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.720]   That's 50 million people who will log on to the iOS for the first time.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.280]   Right.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.640]   Setting up their new phone on Christmas morning and imagining a pop-up saying,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.080]   hey, try Apple Music.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.480]   And if you like it after a month, we'll just charge the iTunes credit card that we already have.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.080]   That could be huge.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   By the way, Pandora has 79.2 million monthly active listeners spotify 60.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.800]   So you're right, Jill.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.440]   Pandora is the king of the hill on this one.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.240]   I have both.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   I don't pay for Pandora.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.320]   I use the free tier.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.080]   But I don't use it that much either.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   I pay for Spotify and I love it.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.720]   Spotify is great.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.320]   That's the one thing.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.600]   Aren't these kind of sticky?
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.640]   We've talked about this before.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.120]   I mean, if you create playlists on Spotify,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.800]   you can't move them over to Apple service.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.960]   So aren't they somewhat sticky?
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.040]   It's not something like you go,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.840]   oh, well, I'm going to have a free Apple service.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.920]   So maybe I'll just cancel my Spotify.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.640]   You're not going to.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.680]   No, you'll lose a lot.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.280]   I think there's two things that Pandora and beats do that are similar.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   Pandora was the one who pioneered the whole music genome project.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.480]   So this was where they hired people to say,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.840]   if you like song A, then you will probably like song B.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.280]   And here's song C by some artist you've never heard of before.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.080]   But it was people behind those algorithms.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.880]   It wasn't just numbers figuring out what you might like based on algorithms.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   It was actually people making those suggestions.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.000]   And if I'm not mistaken, beats does something similar to that.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.560]   And that was part of why Apple was interested in them,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.640]   was this sort of like personal curation, personal selection of music.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.720]   So I think that's probably going to be something that if it works well,
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.160]   could be to their advantage.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.040]   And it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to bring your
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.600]   playlist library with you because you're going to use this service
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   to get recommendations for new music.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.880]   Here's what Bloomberg Business is reporting.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.920]   Apple's new music app will be home to the subscription service,
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.640]   downloads, and a revamped version of iTunes Radio.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.920]   Downloads is interesting because that implies that the iTunes store
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.200]   will be somehow connected to this.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.160]   Yeah, you'll listen to a song and say buy it and download it.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.880]   Now I own it.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.200]   Although I have to say when you have Spotify, why buy music?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.000]   Right, I don't buy me.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.200]   I haven't bought music in forever.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.800]   You want to hear the new Mumford and Sun's album?
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.440]   You just listen.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.920]   Exactly.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.160]   Record industry examples weep when they do the job.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.240]   And that's the problem, isn't it?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.600]   We've all the way to the bank.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.320]   Well, maybe I don't know.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.880]   I think what's happening is the future is definitely human curated,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.440]   tagging, and relational databases that do predictive modeling.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.840]   So there are people that are sitting there listening to the music and tagging it.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   Right.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.320]   And those tags go into a database that hashes through all the stuff it knows about you.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.520]   And then it comes up with predictive models over high probability, low probability of like it.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.920]   And then if you feed any additional information, it refines the model for you.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   I don't feel like Pandora does that great job.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.520]   They pioneered it though, pretty much.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:39.920]   Right.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.040]   But don't you find Pandora repetitive and...
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.920]   So is Spotify, so is iTunes Radio.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.480]   I guess so.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   It has to be repetitive otherwise you can't monetize it.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   It's just like that one penny can't be divided into too many parts.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.520]   So it's intentional.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.040]   Oh.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.680]   Because someone has to be making money somewhere in the chain.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   Let's keep playing that song.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.680]   It's like radio.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.200]   Well, it's not that radio is not repetitive.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.880]   It's all to come in a radio and they dictate a playlist and that's what you hear over.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.560]   Top 40 radio wasn't even 40.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.840]   There were 10 songs made.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.080]   Right.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.120]   Apparently, according to this story in Bloomberg Vision Week,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.320]   artists often welcome videographers and photographers into the studio with them to record
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   behind the scenes video.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.440]   Apple has hired executives to help shoot and produce video
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.280]   from recording sessions with willing musicians.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.720]   So there would be differentiator.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.000]   They'll be like getting an album and opening up the arts and looking at the lyrics.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.840]   That might be the digital equivalent of that.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.960]   The Apple feature artist pages, mostly seen as being promotional.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.080]   They can use to host videos, songs and other things for free.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.720]   This is part of a program Apple's going to call Apple Connect.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.400]   Apple will compensate the artists and labels for songs it gives away.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.120]   So then there's a precedent for this.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.400]   They do that free song of the week.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.280]   They pay for that.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.960]   That comes out of Apple's pocket.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.920]   Apple's negotiations with the record labels,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.760]   Bloomberg goes on to say, "Have drawn the scrutiny of US antitrust officials,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.720]   the FTC is looking at whether Apple's using its position as the largest seller of music downloads."
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.320]   It's the largest seller of music period.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.200]   Forget downloads.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.000]   There's no tower record anymore, kids.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.480]   To put rival music services at its advantage.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.360]   So that's another problem Apple might face.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.960]   You can't be too successful.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   As if the FTC really cares about math.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.720]   Maybe they don't think they care.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.040]   Sitting at their desk being paid, that's something to do.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.760]   Got to do something.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.920]   Right.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.320]   We're talking about the week's news.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.400]   We're talking about what's going to happen at WWDC.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.840]   There's more of that.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.800]   Of course, we're not even close to scratching the surface of what Apple might say tomorrow.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.680]   Greg Panos is here, an expert in virtual reality.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.800]   His website is the Persona Foundation.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.960]   That's where you're talking about all this stuff.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.200]   You're talking about these, what do you call them, avatars?
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.400]   That's more of my human simulation.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.600]   Human simulation.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.960]   It's a portal where I source and...
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.440]   Look, we got to do this.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.280]   I want you to kind of make...
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.480]   We got to figure out a way.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.320]   Like next time Jill's here, she should be sitting here with us.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.760]   Even though if I put my hand, it would go right through it.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.880]   There's a way to do that.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.600]   That's what I think.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.720]   Jessica Yellen did it on CNN.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.560]   At Great Excellency.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.600]   The holography.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.320]   I just spoke at the hologram USA company in Beverly Hills a couple of weeks ago.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.840]   So we could have holographic guests?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.720]   Sure.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.480]   There's a lot of...
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.280]   With that kind of stuff.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.960]   Well, I mean, if you're going to use the hologram USA's tech, it's expensive.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.760]   Yeah, because we'd have to put cameras where Jill is sitting.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.920]   She'd be surrounded by a ring of cameras, right?
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.840]   Well, there's different ways to do it.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.920]   You've got different kinds of reflective screens that peppers ghost effects,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   multiple projectors from different points of view.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.480]   I love peppers ghost.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.440]   It's really a wide open view.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.000]   That's an old magic trick.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.800]   Yeah, it is.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.600]   Pepper's ghost.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.280]   Was it mirrors?
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.240]   How did they do that?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   Well, it's a mirror on a close to 45 degree angle that's semi-transparent.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.800]   And so there's a projector at the top aiming down to the mirror and then...
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.480]   It's like how a DSLR works.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.200]   Right.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.840]   And it's like, yeah, half open shutter.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.240]   Half open, yeah.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.720]   There you go.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.000]   And then you can walk around on the stage behind it and also be registered with the projections.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.520]   So someone looking from the front sees you both at equal brightness.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.400]   There's two of you.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:18.640]   Right.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.480]   So that was a really good meeting down there.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.160]   I just want to not have to come to work.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.880]   Oh, Ray Kurzweil has spoken virtually at conferences.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.280]   Has he?
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.840]   It's called a tele-electron or hollow...
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.680]   I saw that on the Silicon Valley.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.200]   That didn't work so well.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.240]   Hooli had one of those.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.640]   Remember that?
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.120]   Right.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.600]   Also, Jill Duffy here for PC Magazine and from a business insiders,
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.920]   SAI, Steve Kovac.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.240]   It's great to have all three of you and great to have you viewing the show.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.600]   Thank you for joining us this week.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   Our if my doorbell rings, I apologize.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.400]   If you hear this in the middle of the show, actually this will be my phone ringing.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.120]   I'm using...
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.000]   I love this thing.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.360]   I just installed this a few weeks ago.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.400]   The Ring Video Doorbell.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:14.320]   So here's the idea with Ring, you can see and talk to anyone at your door,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.120]   no matter where you are using your smartphone.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.440]   My doorbell rings, even if I'm sitting here,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.920]   I could press a button and say, "Hey, what is it?"
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.760]   It's very clear, by the way.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.320]   It sounds clear.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.000]   You can see them, hear them.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.200]   I could say, "Leave the package and go."
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.320]   Or whatever, you know.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.360]   Get out, go out, get off my lawn, I can say.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.280]   They also have motion sensors in there.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.840]   So I have on my smartphone, every time somebody's moved in front of my door,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.360]   I have a little video of them.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.920]   It is so cool.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.040]   They don't even have to ring your doorbell.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.480]   It turns out that 95% of home break-ins happen during the day.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.440]   And almost always, the burglar rings your doorbell first to see if you're home.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.080]   And then comes in if you're not, but see this time you can respond.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   And you'll have a perfect, clear picture of your burglar.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.680]   There's my front steps.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.320]   Stoop is right there.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.200]   See that car going by?
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.040]   What's he doing?
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.240]   He's casing the joint.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.600]   Does that have a dog barking function?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.360]   Yeah, you should have a dog.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   I could do it.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.000]   [Coughing]
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.200]   Through the fuck.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.120]   Could record Aussie and slow it down.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.080]   I install it myself.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.120]   Look, I'm not a handyman and I will never play one.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.800]   But this thing makes it so easy if you look at the ring kit.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.160]   Is it battery-powered or...?
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:30.960]   There's two ways to go.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.680]   If you have a...
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.640]   We have a wired doorbell, so I just use the existing wires.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.240]   It replaced the existing doorbells.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.480]   My doorbell still rings in the house, just like normal.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.280]   But then it's also his battery power.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.400]   It has lithium-ion batteries.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.160]   In fact, it comes with a USB cable.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.680]   It comes with everything.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.000]   And you can charge it in less about a year.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.200]   Because it doesn't use much juice.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.920]   It comes with a level, a spirit level, a screwdriver handle,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.320]   the bits you need, including the proprietary bit that keeps people
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.880]   stealing it.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.280]   There's got a...
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.160]   Excuse me, special screw in there.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.240]   Great wide-angle camera and the doorbell.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.880]   Time magazine named it one of the top gadgets,
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.480]   the top 10 gadgets of last year.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.720]   I have actually tried, believe it or not, other video doorbells.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.440]   This one is easy.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.240]   It uses Wi-Fi to connect it to the rest of the world.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.600]   Now we got a deal for you too.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.880]   Normally $200, $25 off right now.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.920]   If you go to ring.com/twit, that's $174.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.680]   Everything you need to install it,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.560]   I'm no handyman.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.280]   It took me about...
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   I think if I knew what I was doing,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.000]   it took me about half an hour, it took me an hour.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.560]   Because that was reading the manuals.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.480]   They actually have great videos that show you how to do it.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   I was watching all of that.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.480]   And now, if anybody's at my door, I can see it.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.720]   By the way, if you get a month of recording free,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.360]   it's $30 a year to store all the motion recordings
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.800]   from people at your doorbell.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.400]   So you see these are motion.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.160]   And then if somebody rings the doorbell,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.600]   I'm going back in time now.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.200]   It'll say missed or if you answered it, it'll say answered.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.800]   This is my doorbell.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.960]   I can see when people come and go.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.320]   It's so awesome.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.720]   Ring.com/twit save $25.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.280]   Oh, there's Lisa going off in the segue.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.960]   She's leaving.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.360]   She went to...
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.400]   Is that an hour earlier?
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.280]   That was earlier.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.080]   Because it's a recording.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.800]   I paid the...
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.080]   You get the month free of recording.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.720]   Isn't that cool?
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.840]   It wheels for legs.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.120]   I love my segues.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.440]   So how does this doorbell respond to search warrants?
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.000]   Go away.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.880]   I'm not here.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.320]   I'm the bathtub.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.200]   That's a good question.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.080]   I'll have to try that.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.200]   Next time I get a search warrant,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880]   you can't come in.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.800]   It actually works really well.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.920]   And they can't tell you're not there.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.880]   I mean, it sounds like you're there.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.760]   It's like it's in like an intercom,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.400]   except I'm not.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:42.720]   I'm here.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   Because the police tells them that there's a break.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.240]   The FBI agent gets dragged off in handcuffs.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:48.880]   I love it.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.200]   I'll have to try that.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.240]   Ring.com/
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.520]   If you'd only get away with it once.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.000]   Twit.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.920]   Yeah, once and only once.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.040]   We're talking about WWDC.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.000]   Of course, that's tomorrow.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.360]   We will do live coverage,
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.760]   as we always do with the keynote.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.680]   Mike Elgin, Andy and Aco.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.440]   And I, I think Georgia Dow from IMOR will also be joining us.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.160]   In studio, we expect it'll begin 10 a.m.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.840]   Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.320]   1700 UTC Monday.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.080]   That's June.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.560]   What is that?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.120]   June 9th.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.160]   Tomorrow.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   8th.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.120]   8th.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.440]   Are you going to be in the?
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.080]   Yeah, I'll be there.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.680]   Yeah, I'll be on the floor.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.000]   I have to get there at 8 a.m.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.480]   Really?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.040]   Wow.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.880]   It's at Muscone.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.520]   Is it at the--
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.320]   It's Muscone West.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.120]   It's Muscone West.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.480]   That's the big, big, big one.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.760]   Interesting.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.360]   I guess they're going to have a lot of developers here.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.120]   Do they still throw you out after the keynote?
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.560]   That's what they used to do at WWDC.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.040]   All right.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.200]   There's a, from what I understand this here,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.240]   there's a media lounge to kind of chill out and fire stories.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:46.800]   [Laughter]
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.200]   And then, I'll say, go out the front door.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.640]   They say go over there to the lounge, sit.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.080]   Sit, relax.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.000]   The developers got a gift.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.800]   Sessions, of course.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.000]   Here's your gift bag.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.400]   See ya.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.720]   I don't think we're here any big hardware announcements,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.600]   especially since we now pretty sure we're not going to hear an Apple TV.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.960]   They'll talk about software though.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.360]   Right.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.040]   An Apple Watch SDK.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.840]   That's big.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.560]   Well, it is because it'll allow people to write apps for the watch.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.280]   Natively, yeah.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   Right now, you have to install the app on your phone
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.040]   and then it puts a little stub on your watch.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.600]   It's garbage.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.160]   It's terrible.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.960]   It's so bad.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   They've got to speed up the launch time too,
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.440]   because you try to launch something and you're waiting for--
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.920]   By the time it's done, you could have gotten the phone out,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.880]   done what you wanted to do.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.520]   Like Uber.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.680]   Oh, I'm going to call an Uber my watch.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.240]   Isn't that cool?
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:28.800]   No, it's not.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.320]   You're sitting there spinning, spinning.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.400]   You get the phone out, call the Uber, put it back.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.000]   It's still spinning, spinning.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.320]   Right?
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.360]   It's cool when it works and sometimes it will be a little faster
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.720]   and then it feels like magical.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.360]   And then--
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.240]   But most of the time, yeah.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.520]   You see that little spinning icon.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.640]   It's a great demo.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.960]   I feel like a lot of what's on the--
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   I have a watch too.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.720]   You know, I'm not wearing it.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.840]   I see you wearing a sport.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.800]   I got the sport one.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.680]   It's very pretty.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.720]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.480]   You could make a commercial where you call the Uber
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.160]   and it picks a guy up that's 10 feet away from you first.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.600]   And then you wait another hour.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.200]   No, no, no, that's no commercials at all.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:01.840]   It took too long.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.720]   10 seconds too long.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   I feel like increasingly, I feel like the Apple Watch
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.840]   is not delivering what it promised.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.080]   I enjoy using it, but it's weird because I get more out of it
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.080]   when I strip out a lot of the features.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.560]   Like--
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.280]   Maybe that's the key.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.000]   I like the glance.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.600]   You don't want too many notifications.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:19.840]   Right.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.040]   You want fewer glances.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.880]   I find I spend a ton of time twiddling, tweaking,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.280]   pushing, zooming, and it's not--
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.520]   People try to use it like a mini smartphone on your wrist.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.960]   And I don't think you should use it that way.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.520]   Like an interface.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.320]   Chill, did you-- you were the one who told me--
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.840]   introduced me to the basis watch.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.800]   You used-- you've used every one of these.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   And you particularly focus on the fitness aspects.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.120]   What do you think of the fitness aspects on the Apple Watch?
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.600]   You know, I haven't played with it so much,
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.320]   but my real question to people about what you and Greg
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.920]   were just talking about is what were your original expectations?
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.120]   For the Apple Watch?
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.160]   Because I feel like that's really where the disconnect is,
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.640]   that people don't necessarily have a clear idea in their head
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.160]   what they want it to do.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.720]   Right.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.600]   They just think it's going to be some magical extension
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.920]   of their smartphone, but they're not really having
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.760]   a realistic expectation of the kinds of notifications
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.160]   that's going to deliver, how it's going to deliver those,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.080]   and how often you're going to be looking at it.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.360]   So I'm actually curious to ask both you and Greg Leo--
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.480]   Actually, Steve, who has--
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:20.640]   Steve.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.600]   Steve, I had to watch Greg.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.080]   Oh, Steve.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.400]   Greg doesn't have it, yeah.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:22.880]   Sorry.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.920]   What you thought it was going to do or what you wanted it to do.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.960]   What were your expectations?
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.240]   What did you hope for, Steve?
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.120]   Well, that's a thing.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.480]   I don't think Apple did a good job explaining what this thing is supposed to do.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.920]   You know, we got the iPhone that have really good explanation of,
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.160]   you know, smartphones have stunk for years,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.040]   now we made it better.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.840]   But we get the Apple Watch and here's all the stuff it can do,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.400]   but know like why do you need this thing?
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.880]   I almost feel like Apple had hoped it would do more.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.480]   It was disappointed that it couldn't do as much as they wanted it to do.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:52.880]   Right.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.920]   And they even threw in stuff because it wasn't going to do whatever blood pressure monitoring.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   So they threw in the heartbeat--
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.040]   Not the heart rate sensor, the sending a heartbeat to somebody
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.920]   and drawing little pictures because they just needed something.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.080]   They needed to give it some special sauce.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.240]   Here, I'll tell you what my expectation was, and it's absolutely been dashed.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.080]   Apple has in the past taken existing categories like MP3 players
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.640]   and shown the way with the iPod.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.920]   Like, this is how you do it with smartphones.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.320]   They showed the way with the iPhone.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   There were smartphones before the iPhone, but the iPhone reinvented the category.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.320]   iPad reinvented the tablet.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.120]   I really hoped, I didn't, I actually didn't expect,
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.320]   but I hope, because I've used, as you have a Jill, you know, I use the bay,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.000]   I bought the basis because you said to buy it.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.680]   I've been using Android Wear.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.640]   I've used every smartwatch, all the Samsung smartwatches.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.400]   And I knew that they were much like the early days of MP3 players
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.880]   and smartphones and tablets, not there.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   And I'd hoped that Apple would reinvent the category and point the way to something better.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.760]   In fact, I feel like they did the opposite.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.120]   I think they tried to do too much.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.520]   I think the user interface is god awful.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.280]   It takes a day to learn it, to get used to, at least a day, which is--
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.120]   And even if you learn it, it's terrible.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.440]   I mean, the little dot icons that you zoom in and out, that's useless.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.800]   That's why I never go to the App screen.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.280]   I almost accept to maybe set a timer or something.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.640]   I almost never look at the apps.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.960]   I find it most useful as a watch, quickly glance at it when it vibrates.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.440]   You're saying if you lower your expectations, Leo, you'll be happy.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.800]   Well, this is the thing, like any Apple product that comes out,
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.200]   the expectations are through the roof or they're redefining this category and so forth.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.800]   I don't know if they get that.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.200]   If you're saying in the chat room and they write the iPhone itself when it first came out,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.280]   wasn't all it was going to be.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.520]   But there was no question when you play with an iPhone,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.720]   this is a breakthrough product.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.640]   Yeah, multi-touch by itself.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.560]   Multi-touch was a breakthrough.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.720]   The fact that you could use a browser on the phone and actually have an experience of a website
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.440]   that was much like the desktop experience, that was a breakthrough.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.840]   But that's not what we're seeing.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.960]   I don't think with the Apple watch.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.440]   Jill, you don't have what Jill I take.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.720]   No, I don't have one.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.000]   I just borrow.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.400]   But one of the things I often hear people saying is that we have to remember a lot of people
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.520]   who write about technology are on the East Coast and the West Coast.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.000]   Right.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.840]   Specifically, this is just going to New York, where we don't have a lot of cars.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.240]   And I often hear from people who want smartwatches, they say,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.880]   "I want it because when I'm in my car and I got an important message,
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.640]   I want to be able to glance at something, maybe hit a button and reply back,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.760]   "Hey, I'm driving.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.880]   Let me know if it's important."
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.120]   But I think there are certain use cases like being in a car
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.440]   that sometimes people in San Francisco and New York don't connect with very well.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.200]   I drive a car every day.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.400]   And I got to tell you...
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.680]   That's why I kind of want to ask you.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.480]   I got to tell you, if you did that, you would crash.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.600]   It is as difficult, if not more difficult to use your watch as using a smartphone.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.360]   You shouldn't do either while you're driving.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:51.760]   Of course not.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.400]   Because the watch is distracting and you need both hands,
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.600]   because one hand is holding it, the other one's twiddling the little knob.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.920]   And all of a sudden you're in an accident.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.360]   So I want to tie this in with one more thing, which is Google Glass,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.760]   which we all know failed as a consumer product.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.520]   I still think it actually had a lot of wonderful uses in the world of industry,
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.080]   like if you're on an oil rig, for example.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.920]   But in consumer life, we decided this is not something we want.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.000]   But if you think about it, it was going to do very similar things
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.280]   that the Apple Watch and other smart watch promised.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.480]   It was going to be something that would give you a quick glance
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.040]   that wouldn't distract you so much, give you information that was pertinent,
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.840]   view information that was relevant to your context,
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.000]   and that you could go along with your day.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.200]   And everybody decided, no, no, no, no, this is not what we want at all.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.720]   It's ugly, it's another device, it has to be recharged every night.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:54.240]   And I think it's important to remember that there are sociological instances
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.760]   for when we do and do not want to use certain devices.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.600]   And I think we've grown accustomed to having our smartphone and being
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.360]   dependent on it as sort of our primary device in a lot of ways.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.920]   And I don't think we're going to break away from that too easily
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.760]   with a peripheral device like a watch or a pair of glasses.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.480]   I think you're right.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.640]   I think you're right.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.400]   Steve's Apple Watch review came out in Business Insider in May.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.760]   You'd had it for a week or two.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760]   I used it for a week before I read that review.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.960]   Would you stand by what you said?
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.680]   Totally.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   I use it mostly as a watch.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.240]   You know, I gave it to my boss and he freaked out saying like,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.960]   "I can't do all the... why is it... I can't do anything on it?
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.880]   My phone already does all the same stuff."
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.000]   And I really think people are looking at it the wrong way.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.120]   We're just asking it too much.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.040]   Yeah, I've become addicted to mine.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.400]   I tested the Pebble also, the new Pebble Time.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.520]   And I took it off for a few hours to let one of my video producers
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.800]   shoot a video with it.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   And I felt naked without a watch.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.160]   They say that's one of the tests.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.760]   But you... is it...
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.520]   If you left the house with that, it would you go back and...
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.240]   Yeah, I totally would.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:04.560]   You would.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.640]   I found myself and went to lunch and I was looking at my naked wrist
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.240]   like several times, looking for the time, the weather, if I had a text.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.240]   And as you pointed out, you are not a watch wearer.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   You had no other watch audience since...
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   ...or maybe?
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.080]   I like watches as jewelry.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.360]   I don't feel like we need them to tell the time because really,
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.600]   we got lots of time all around us.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.640]   I like clocks though.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.480]   I mean, we have clocks everywhere in the studio.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.680]   I like the episode of Will It Blend where they tested the Apple Watch.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.720]   That hurts every time I see them do that.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.160]   That just hurts me.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.440]   It's like, "Why destroy it?"
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.280]   "Oh, perfectly good watch."
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.920]   Lens fine.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.080]   Just don't breathe it once you open the window.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.880]   Right.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.000]   Right.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.880]   That's probably true.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.160]   I don't know what that's made out of.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.920]   Human tears.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.520]   I feel like the watch...
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.400]   If you haven't bought the watch, don't feel like you need to buy the watch.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.080]   The reason this came up is Apple was probably going to show how
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.920]   people can write apps for the watch.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.080]   Will they run faster?
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.160]   Ideally, yes.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   I hope so, because they don't run fast enough now.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.040]   If they have this app, we'll be able to take advantage of all the sensors.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.000]   They'll be able to do more.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.680]   So Fitbit and John Bone and whoever else can write an Apple Watch app.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.960]   You don't have to buy a Fitbit.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.400]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.280]   Apple just bought an...
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:17.760]   Oh.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.720]   Oh.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   Oh.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.160]   He's blending it.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.880]   Oh, geez.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.080]   At least it's a sport model.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.440]   There's $400 on that.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.280]   Apple just bought an AR company called Mataya.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.520]   So they have some pretty interesting applications that
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.120]   fill in information about what you're doing.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.240]   So I could see having a watch and sort of like moving it around and having it
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.680]   give alerts and stuff as you're moving into a particular direction of Chinese food or something like that.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.720]   Chinese food that way.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.200]   Right.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.480]   It's like letting your finger in sticking it in the...
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.720]   Instead, you go like this.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.040]   Right.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.520]   It's the whole symbology of what's going on around you in space time.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.720]   Very simple visual symbology circles and squares and arrows and pointers.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.440]   Popping up and popping down depending on its position.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.360]   And the sensor's knowing where it is.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.920]   Well, so apps could make a big difference in that regard because...
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.760]   You can't even do animation on the Apple Watch today.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.240]   Not really.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.520]   You can only put pictures up.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.440]   The real problem is so many developers are trying to cram a smartphone app into this little tiny screen.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.000]   It doesn't...
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.640]   Like Instagram.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.600]   Marco Armin observed that.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.240]   He said it might...
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.000]   He did it wrong the first time too.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.960]   I did it wrong the first time, yeah.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:31.120]   And, you know, I don't want to squint at news headlines and Instagram photos and tweets on my wrist.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.800]   No, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   It should be very quick in and out.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.320]   And if you want to do anything beyond glancing at your wrist, you go to the phone.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.920]   But that's going to disappoint people because they wanted to do a whole lot more.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.400]   And that's also Apple's fault to a degree for not putting it into good context what this thing is
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.040]   supposed to do.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.400]   We will see a new iOS.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.480]   This is one thing Apple's done pretty well every year.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.360]   There's a new iPhone.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.680]   And every year there's a new iOS, iOS 9 code named Monarch not after the butterfly after a ski resort.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.720]   And of course, this is a developers conference.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.080]   So that's really what people who come to WWC want to hear about.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.440]   What's the next generation of...
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   In fact, you know, we have some interest.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.360]   We're starting to work or we're thinking of...
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.240]   We're planning to start to plan to work on a...
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:19.040]   We're going to consider planning to start to work on a plan that would give us an app.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.720]   But that's one of the things we have to think about is, well, wait a minute, should we start working on apps?
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.880]   Today when Android M and iOS 9 are imminent, should we wait?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:35.520]   But the consensus seems to be iOS 9 will be as huge a difference between say, 6 and 7.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.840]   And it'll be two years before people have Android M anyway.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.160]   So...
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.280]   M is nothing to worry about.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:48.720]   iOS 9 and in fact OS 10, 10.11 code named Gala, Apple has kind of sent signals that we're just
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.520]   going to make these.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.880]   We're not going to make big new features. We're going to make them a little bit better, smarter,
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   faster, and so forth.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.720]   Gala means milk in Greek.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.520]   I think they're probably named after the Apple.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.160]   Like Gala.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   Apple.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.640]   Like Gala.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   Gala.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.280]   Galaxy.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:03.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.240]   Gala.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.040]   I think it's more likely...
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   Oh, but it is a little bit like Galaxy, isn't it?
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.840]   I didn't think of that.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.600]   Cop in Samsung.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.080]   Hmm.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.120]   Yes.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.920]   The Milky Way Gala.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.600]   I think the biggest thing about iOS 9 is...
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.240]   Galaxy.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.880]   They're kind of rewriting it for the older Apple devices.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.080]   You know, Apple always gets dinged for, you know, you update iOS and it slows down your phone.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:28.160]   It sounds like it's going to be better on older devices, which is great for emerging markets
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.600]   where people are using iPhone 4s as whatever's...
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.200]   That's a big change from Apple. Usually Apple really wants to push you to the new thing.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.440]   I had somebody called the radio show today who had an iPad 2 and he says, "Getting slower and
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.120]   slower." I said, "Actually, it's not. It's just iOS is getting more and more demanding,
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.160]   but this would be a big improvement if he could continue to use this iPad 2."
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.800]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.040]   Now, there will be some changes to the desktop interface regarding security.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.360]   They're going to introduce this new rootless
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:06.000]   state for OS 10 that will prevent even administrative level users from accessing protected system files.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.560]   It also, rootless is handy because it prevents jailbreaking.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.040]   Right.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:11.760]   On iOS.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.240]   Do you even need to jailbreak anymore?
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.360]   Is there even a jailbreak community to allow?
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.720]   Is there a jailbreak anymore?
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.560]   I feel like we never hear about it anymore.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.400]   I'm sure people are still doing it.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.120]   By the way, I'm sorry.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.200]   I said rootless is for OS 10 is for iOS.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.120]   iCloud Drive, boy, they need to fix that.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.960]   That thing, I don't know what's going on with it.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.840]   It's confusing and it's difficult and it's done.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.600]   None of my Macs does it work.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:45.200]   Trusted Wi-Fi is in development that could be part of this year's iOS or maybe next year.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.640]   It would allow iOS devices to connect to authorized wireless routers without additional security measures.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:57.840]   But would require a more heavily encrypted wireless connection for non-trusted routers.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.480]   This is all from Mark Gurman at 9-5 and he's usually pretty good.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.520]   His source is excellent.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.320]   He's pretty solid.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.120]   He has the stuff.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   Split screen apps for iPad.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.720]   That'll be interesting.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.000]   I feel like that's the wrong direction.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.760]   It's like a concession a little bit to get to Samsung's dual windows.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.360]   And surface a little bit.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.440]   I know before I tried to use split screen.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.400]   It's too small a screen.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   I guess on surface it makes a little bit of sense.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:22.880]   It makes sense on surface.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.920]   Do you think Apple's really losing
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.440]   sales to iPad sales to the Microsoft?
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.680]   No, I think people are hanging onto their iPads longer.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.400]   That's the problem.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   Yeah, you change your phone every year,
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.840]   maybe usually over two years,
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.600]   but you can hang onto the iPad for three, four, maybe even five years if we push it.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.400]   So this is an interesting way that split screen will probably set it up to
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.960]   when they have the jumbo sized iPad later this year.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.520]   Both Android and Microsoft have for a long time off,
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.160]   not for a long time,
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.440]   Microsoft is for a long time.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.520]   Android just started offering multi-user mode where you could have in Lollipop.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.200]   You could have multiple users,
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.680]   which for a tablet makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.040]   Apple's never allowed that,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.120]   but there is a rumor that there will.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.760]   I would love to see this iPad Pro.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   I hope I don't know if they'll announce this tomorrow.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.600]   No, it's not going to be the fall with the typical day when they announce your iPads.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.400]   Apple Pay expanded the United Kingdom in Canada,
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.040]   but HomeKit is going to be big.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.480]   HomeKit is going to be a big announcement,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:29.280]   and we mentioned that the Apple TV is going to be the gateway device for HomeKit,
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.120]   and they've already announced some HomeKit devices.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:37.040]   Even last year, a bunch of big names like Philips and household names that we know
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.120]   had said we're going to make stuff for this platform.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:46.160]   I feel like home automation is something people wanted 10 years ago,
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.680]   and now less-
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.240]   15 years ago.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.440]   Or 15 years ago.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.800]   And now we've kind of gave up.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.640]   Do you really-
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.680]   What do you think?
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   I think all the Snowden revelations have
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.160]   welcomed people up to the fact that-
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.440]   It's just a spite of advice.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.440]   If the government wants back doors and everything,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.320]   and criminals can get into those places,
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   then all your stuff can be robbed by people that aren't the government,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.480]   that aren't interested in protecting you,
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.720]   and that as long as the government isn't going to make a point of protecting you,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.120]   they just want to be able to source you,
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.520]   and they're not going to make any promises about protecting you from other people,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.520]   that aren't so honest or aren't so interested in your welfare,
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.120]   then why invest in something that's going to put you at risk,
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.640]   until everyone else around you says,
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.600]   "Oh, this is safe."
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:40.400]   People see the Internet of Things as really an Internet of spy devices.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.080]   They're watching me on my nest.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.280]   Well, now they know it could be.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.120]   And hackers too.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.920]   It's what you don't know that scares you.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.840]   Maybe that's where that-
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.280]   There's a refrigerator that got hacked a year or two ago,
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.400]   which I thought was hilarious.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.160]   Why did I keep getting more milk?
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.200]   It's kind of too bad for the consumer business that they're taking a hit over privacy,
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.520]   but this is stuff people should know.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.880]   They should make decisions about it.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.200]   If they decide not to buy products as a result of it, then-
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   NSA.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.080]   The corporateocracy that runs America needs to
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.560]   rein in various controls.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   Now, I'm interested in this,
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.080]   and we've heard rumors before about something called proactive assistant.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.840]   Is it a Siri upgrade or a replacement?
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.120]   It sounds like an addition to Siri, I guess.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.160]   It kind of indexes apps or apps can plug into it.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.080]   It's kind of like now on tap, which Google announced two weeks ago.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.360]   I feel like there's a great race going on between Apple, Google,
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.960]   and of course, Microsoft's Cortana for these intelligent assistants.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.040]   In almost every case, they're like the Apple Watch.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.360]   They promised much and delivered little.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.640]   They're frustrating to use.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.440]   And I think Siri is not the best of the three.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.240]   Not at all.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.040]   Not even close.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.920]   Do you like Google now?
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.480]   I love Google now.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.080]   Yeah, I use Google now on my phone.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.680]   On your Apple?
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.720]   Because you have to launch the Google app to even use it.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.080]   No, it sends you notifications.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.200]   It sent me a notification to come here and make it on time.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:03.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.080]   That's one of the reasons I use Android is I love Google now.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.520]   As well.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.800]   But you know what's going to...
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.720]   Here's a dark horse in this that nobody's considered Amazon.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.160]   Alexa.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.800]   The Amazon Echo is starting to prove to be really cool.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.320]   Do you have one?
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.960]   No, I'm on a waiting list forever.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.560]   But we had one for review because one of our editors was smart enough to order one
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.080]   when it first came out.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.680]   It was $99 if your Amazon Prime, they've raised that to 150 bucks
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.960]   and they've really constrained supply.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.080]   You can't even get two.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.040]   Right.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.360]   If you get an invitation, you can get one.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.200]   I ordered one and it's supposed to come late July, early August.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.840]   But many of our viewers have them and it's impressive as heck.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.720]   Sounds really cool.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.320]   You can now add to your calendar.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.600]   You could say make an appointment.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.480]   You can have it play.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.120]   They just integrated Audible books.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.160]   So you can listen to Audible books.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.240]   You can listen to podcasts using TuneIn.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.040]   You can say, I won't call it ALEXA.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.080]   What should I call it?
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.880]   We got to be, this is by the way, another big problem.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.160]   I can't say any of these words.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.440]   Okay.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.080]   You know who.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.840]   Hey, you know who.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.600]   Because everybody watching at home, all of a sudden there's stuff
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.200]   that starts talking to them.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.000]   The Amazon Echo, I said we could say, hey, echo.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.480]   How about that?
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.680]   I don't think it responds to that.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.720]   It's really getting very sophisticated.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.400]   It has a speaker built into it.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.200]   And it's not mobile.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.880]   It's designed to sit in your room.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.320]   But you talk to it and it's kind of almost what I really want.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.200]   I wanted an intelligent assistant I could talk to.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.600]   A friend.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.040]   A friend.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:43.360]   Okay.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.960]   That's the truth.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.440]   Well, you know, my come from the Chinese, Baidu has a huge AI group now.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.000]   Do they?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.040]   Yeah, that's a big trick.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   That's interesting.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.960]   Run by Andrew Ng at a Stanford.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.560]   So they've got like 150, 150 AI researchers.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.720]   And they're all looking at the same stuff that Kurzweil is looking at at Google.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:06.560]   Natural language understanding, learning, machine learning, predictive modeling.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.720]   So, you know, what you're asking for and what you want it to do,
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:15.120]   you'll eventually get your frustration will be solved because there's many, many, many minds
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.880]   that work that are doing that.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.280]   Well, in fact, while Google is probably doing the foremost speech recognition stuff in the United
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.200]   States, China has been because in fact, China might need it more than we need it.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.760]   Yeah, the problems are not specific to the English language.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:27.920]   Right.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.280]   They're specific to all cultures.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.440]   So you think we'd benefit by doing research or would it require Chinese?
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.760]   Well, I think if you can make it work in other languages and other cultures,
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.360]   probably the American culture would probably be a simpler subset.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.200]   Really you think so because we're simpler people.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.000]   Well, I mean, they're the rules.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.120]   Chinese is tough.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.160]   The rules of our language are a little more rigid.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.880]   Right.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:58.240]   So you can plan a machine learning algorithm to navigate through those rules quickly.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.960]   Chinese is as most that the older language gets, the more it gets sanded down.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.240]   The edges get sanded down.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:11.280]   So languages that haven't evolved over time like Russian or Latin or very rigid, rigorous,
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.520]   with lots of declensions and conjugations.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.120]   But they're easy for machines to figure out.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.200]   And so that makes it easier for machines.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.960]   But Chinese doesn't even have past tense or it doesn't have it tenses.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.160]   Yeah, there's a lot of sort of cultural context.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.000]   Yeah, it's very contextual.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.280]   Go into the analytical.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.240]   Yeah, well, that must be.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.840]   If they could get it working in Chinese, you're right.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.200]   I bet they'd be a lot easier to do.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.480]   Big demand for it.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.720]   People don't want to drive off the road.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.400]   You know, they want to be able to find something very quickly by just speaking it out.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.640]   Right.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.360]   Well, I'll be curious to see what Apple says about this new proactive.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.800]   And it might not even happen tomorrow.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.360]   That's like something they're thinking about using.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.720]   So it could be another year before they get that up to snuff.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.680]   And even then I'm not confident it will be knowing them.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.280]   Siri's been a little bit of a disappointment.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.640]   In fact, I almost feel like Siri, the app that they purchased, worked better than Siri.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.880]   The app that I remember it's been so long.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.320]   You could make restaurant reservations.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:02.800]   Oh, that's true.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.680]   You can't do it.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:09.120]   But you could then it's like they haven't even caught up with the app that they bought.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.480]   I use it to set my alarm.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.000]   And that's it.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.400]   That's it.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.520]   Like it's really and the same thing I used to watch to do that.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.040]   You know, set a timer for 10 minutes.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.600]   Yeah, that's all I do.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.800]   That's really great when you're cooking.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.560]   It's about it.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.040]   Has Apple fixed the iMessage flaw yet?
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:25.760]   Which one?
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.520]   The one where you send a weird malformed Unicode string and it crashes iMessage?
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.080]   I don't remember.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.120]   I think I think it's not.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.480]   Is there has there been a patch?
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.680]   I don't think so.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.760]   Someone in the chat room will probably tell us.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.800]   iOS.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.240]   Are we still at 813?
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.520]   Huh?
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.280]   You know, Skype?
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:43.920]   I don't think so.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.400]   Skype fixed it.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.760]   Skype fixed it less than a day.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.040]   Of course, that's just one application.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.080]   I think Apple has to fix the whole basis.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.440]   Core text is the problem.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.240]   They have to fix it.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.440]   Why haven't they fixed it yet?
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.520]   It's been like 10 days.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.880]   Maybe they'll announce that tomorrow too.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.440]   No, they will not.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.520]   That's one thing you know that we'll come on stage and say,
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.200]   "Oh yeah, we had this problem, but we fixed it."
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.480]   No.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.640]   It's the thinnest, lightest bug we've ever solved.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.480]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.120]   We are talking Jill Duffy is here for PC Magazine,
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.280]   Washington based.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.000]   She covers all wearables as one of her beats.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.800]   Health, lifestyle.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.000]   It's good to have you here, Jill.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.360]   Steve Kovac.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:25.760]   Thank you.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.800]   Thank you for being here.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.400]   Steve Kovac from Business Insider.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.520]   And Greg Pano.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.400]   Panos.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.600]   Nice Greek name.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.040]   That's why you know what galaxy is.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.160]   Galaxy's milk.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.480]   "Goripanigote spaniyotakis."
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.080]   Could you read that Greek that we had in the fairy message earlier before the show?
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.560]   Does that look?
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.680]   It was Greek letters.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.320]   It wasn't Greek.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.680]   My grandfather had the sense of shortening it.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.160]   That was the name?
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.680]   Say that again.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.760]   "Goripanigote spaniyotakis."
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.600]   Wow.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.720]   I didn't realize it was your name.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.840]   I thought you were saying hello.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.200]   How are you, my name?
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:57.680]   Wow.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.800]   Well, that's not a my verse.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.840]   I thought he was swearing at you.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.040]   I didn't know what he was saying.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.840]   Well, I know, no, just enough Greek to get my face punched.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.960]   I wanted to say, "Opa!"
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.120]   And to order in a restaurant.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.760]   That flaming cheese thing.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.560]   The sticho.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.000]   "Saganaki."
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.960]   The flaming cheese.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.600]   It's good.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.720]   Greek food is very good.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.280]   I know.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.080]   I grew up on it.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.560]   Where is the best Greek restaurant in San Francisco?
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.040]   Is there one?
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.480]   I don't know.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.960]   I just went to the San Jose Greek festival last week.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.320]   I love those.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.080]   I stayed with Daniel Kockies when my best friend said...
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.560]   Those are fun.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.280]   Yeah, Dan's great.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:27.600]   I love that.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.520]   We went down there and I bought a whole bunch of pastitio and baklava and galaktapurica or
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.320]   Greek dessert.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.160]   Galaktapurico is galactic burrito.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   So it basically looks like a burrito and it's stuffed with like warm custard,
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.840]   which is the gala or the galactic or the milk portion of it.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.400]   That's the Greek dessert.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.200]   It's hard to find.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:51.920]   It's delicious.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.400]   Got two of those.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.080]   I'm going to get an octopus.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.120]   Into that.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.920]   A seascoaster is not good for the rich.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.320]   That's right.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   This is taking shaker white castle or what?
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.040]   Both.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.720]   This is actually a triceway castle.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.960]   People don't understand the slider is a great thing.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.840]   Yeah, east coast.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.520]   It's America's greatest inventions.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   Our show name brought to you by Citrix.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.600]   Go to meeting.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   You want virtual...
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.880]   You got it with Go to meeting.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.720]   It's the perfect way to meet with clients and co-workers from the convenience of your computer,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.640]   your smartphone, your tablet.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.760]   You'll share the same screen so you're on the same page.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.880]   And you'll see each other face to face with their HD video conferencing.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.840]   It's so cool.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.080]   Not that everybody has a camera on their iPad, their phone, on their computer.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.560]   It's great.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.800]   You can really go to a meeting and you really see people.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.000]   And I think biologically we're getting more and more used to this idea
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.600]   that this is like a face to face meeting.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.880]   I don't know why, but more and more we've been using Go to meeting and more and more.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.680]   I feel like this is good.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.320]   This is better.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   Certainly eliminates travel.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.200]   I don't have to worry about traffic or travel expenses or flying anywhere.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.240]   I can meet with any of our clients or colleagues anywhere all around the world.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.360]   And I feel like it's just as good if not better.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.200]   I want you to sign up for Go to meeting today.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.480]   Free.

[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.480]   Those guys have been supporters since day one of Twit.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.520]   And I really appreciate everything they've done for us.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.960]   30 days free.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.080]   See and be seen.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.040]   Hey, if you missed anything, we had a big week this week on Twit.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.680]   Let's take a look at some of the fun things that happened.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.160]   Previously on Twit.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.920]   And of course we were treated once again to the site at Google I/O
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.440]   of a large number of people all using some sort of virtual reality.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.720]   This is straight out of Wally.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.320]   This week in Google.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.960]   Everybody focuses on the fact that it's just the viewer is cheap.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.040]   Well, but I think the viewer is just a holder.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.520]   If the argument is that this is too expensive,
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.760]   then virtual reality has no place in school.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.520]   Know how.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.120]   We're going to be showing you how to make a crazy fast home build,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.280]   probably the easiest build we've ever done.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.400]   Flash drive that will be cheaper and faster than the things you could buy in the market.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.720]   Ah, it's like face melting.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.600]   It really is.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.760]   The new screen savers.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.280]   We're going to burn stuff right now,
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   and I'm hoping that we're not going to burn ourselves.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.200]   I think she's aiming at us.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.000]   Twit.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.080]   Kid tested, mother approved.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:45.440]   Okay, a little tip here.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.640]   A little tip here.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.600]   Never give your wife a flaming torch on a string.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.800]   And then stand there and we've heard a swing at you.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.600]   That's a great video though.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.880]   I'll do anything for my craft.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.160]   Hey, we've got a big week coming up.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.840]   Mike Elgin, our news director.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.120]   What do we expect?
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.600]   Coming up this week, Apple's worldwide developers conference starts tomorrow.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.760]   That's Monday, June 8th in San Francisco.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.240]   Because of that, our daily news show Tech News Today airs one hour early tomorrow at 9am
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.600]   Pacific, New Eastern.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.720]   Join Leo, Andy, Anatko, Georgia Dow, and me at 10am Pacific for live coverage
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.000]   of the big Apple keynote.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.840]   Also, a Chinese handset maker called G-O-N-E is expected to unveil two new phones Wednesday in
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.400]   Beijing.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.520]   One of them, called the eLife E8, is expected to have a 23.7 megapixel camera on the back,
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.280]   cable of shooting 4K video.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.640]   And on Thursday, June 11th, Facebook's Oculus VR is holding an event they're calling
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.800]   Step Into the Rift in San Francisco.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.080]   We'll find out what that's all about.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   That's what's coming up this week.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.360]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.200]   It's getting exciting in the VR world.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.760]   One of the reasons we wanted Greg to be in studio with us today is because of this,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.440]   your particular expertise in this.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   This is Google Cardboard based.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   Google showed off Cardboard at their I/O.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.200]   It's very inexpensive.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.080]   How much was this, John?
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.640]   This is $25, but it's a little more solid.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.400]   It's got one of the things I don't like about Cardboard.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.400]   You have to hold it to your, like a view master.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.360]   You have to hold it to your head.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.120]   So this has a strap.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.480]   You still put your phone in here.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.000]   This is actually kind of smart because
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.400]   the phone is a very powerful computer with a very good screen.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.520]   It really adds everything you need to do VR to what is basically just a holder.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.160]   Stereoscopic viewing advisor.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.880]   Galaxy, Samsung is the same thing with the Galaxy.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.360]   If you are, I bought one of those for my Galaxy S6.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   I had an amazing experience.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:44.640]   The other night, I had got the on Saturday, I guess it was Friday, I got the VR in the mail.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.800]   And we were having the sixth grade graduation party for Lisa's son.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.120]   So we had a lot of kids and I thought, "Oh, this is cool."
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.160]   I said, "Kids, you're going to think back."
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.560]   I remember in 2015, that crazy guy showed me these,
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.880]   I experienced VR for the first time.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.840]   And I think that those kids, I have to say, I was very negative about VR.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.280]   I have changed my tune.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.240]   I feel like those kids are going to experience for the first time on Friday,
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.360]   something that's going to be a big part of their life going forward.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.800]   But I didn't get a chance to play with the Galaxy VR, so I got in bed.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.120]   And I said, "Lisa, I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to just play with this a little bit."
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.520]   So first thing I learned, you can't lie on your back,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.960]   because it knows where it's oriented.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.240]   You have to sit up.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.000]   And then I found a Cirque du Soleil.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.080]   Oh, I've done that one. That one's cool.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.200]   Oh my God.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.360]   You're on stage with them.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.240]   Oh, you're on stage and they're performing all the way around you.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.640]   And anywhere you look, there's something going on.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.360]   I got so excited. I jumped out of bed and I'm going, "Oh!"
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.680]   And it's really like an experience of the Cirque du Soleil.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.120]   Now the resolution's noticeably lower than real life.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.520]   There's some suspension of disbelief that has to go on.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   And obviously you look like an idiot.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.160]   But the experience was, to me, an eye opener.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.800]   I feel like, "Oh, I get it.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.320]   I'm not that interested in VR gaming.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.800]   It makes me nauseous to have moving through a game when I'm not moving."
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.840]   I feel like that's not a good thing for me.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.480]   But I love these VR experiences.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.920]   There's a Paul McCartney concert.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.880]   You can sit on stage.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.680]   I've done that one too.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.440]   Is that back also?
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:23.840]   Back?
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.000]   I think that's a really good use for it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.640]   And Google, of course, has that Apollo platform.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.840]   I'm sorry, what is it called?
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.440]   Loop, loom, jump.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.320]   Platform with 16 cameras.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.160]   And I imagine that's what they're using.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.760]   And they're just putting it in the middle of--
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.640]   A lot of VR now is 360 video.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.840]   So what it is is it shoots a special image and then you're head.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.960]   And the sensor's in your visor, whatever system it is,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.200]   allows you to have a rectified image,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.000]   which is a sphere in which you're looking around from the point of view of the 360 camera.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.400]   You can even look down and see kind of the base of the camera.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.680]   Sometimes you can see artifacts that show the stitching between the cameras or the base.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.280]   The stitching's gotten very good.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.240]   This Cirque du Soleil was as far as I could tell, perfect.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.200]   There was no distortion, no weird parallax.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.880]   Yeah, and Oculus just bought one of the major stitching companies called Color, K-O-L-O-R.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.120]   It was either Oculus or Google.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.680]   It was Oculus?
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.240]   It was Oculus.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:22.640]   Or Google, yeah.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.520]   Google bought color.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.200]   So what's happening?
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:32.240]   Google, Facebook, AK Oculus, and Apple are all scooping up companies.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:32.880]   What's Apple doing?
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.760]   Viling patents.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.280]   That would be great to know.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.840]   Apple Bolt Mattio, which is an AR company.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.240]   There are probably a lot of other acquisitions we don't know about.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.120]   I was kind of skeptical of virtual reality.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.280]   That's where you have to put on a helmet and you seal out the world.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.960]   Yeah, you're occluded from the world.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.440]   occluded.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.000]   And I was more excited when I saw Microsoft's HoloLens.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.400]   I thought augmented reality, where I'm seeing the world with additions.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.080]   That's really the future.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.880]   But I think now-
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.280]   Still look like a-
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.320]   You can put two stereo cameras on a VR system and have it act like an AR system.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.360]   In fact, you can see around you.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.320]   You can do that with cardboard.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.920]   The camera, you make the camera active.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.720]   Right.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.920]   Now cardboard seems to be compatible with Oculus.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.960]   In other words, the demos I download for Oculus seem to work on my-
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.840]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.600]   They're all just spin-offs from stereo, scopic rendering.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.640]   It's two pictures.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:22.960]   Right.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.920]   Right and left eye image and point of view changes.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.920]   So there really isn't anything that would make this,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.280]   you know, hardware specific.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:29.840]   Or is there?
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.600]   You could, I guess.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.360]   Well, you know, I posed a good question to Palmer Lucky at CES.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.160]   That a lot of VR is going mobile,
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.640]   like the Samsung that you have.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.080]   And some of these experience packages,
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.440]   like the Polma, Kardonnay,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.160]   Comf-
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.440]   You know, singing or the Becca, you know, song,
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.360]   are 200, 150 megabyte download packages.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:53.760]   Huge.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.400]   So if you're on T-Mobile and you've got a 6 gigabyte cap,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.200]   and then all of a sudden you try a bunch of VR stuff out,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.840]   you've blown your cap after just a couple of days.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.800]   So there are going to be some real problems in the future.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.640]   And some of these devices.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.680]   What about streaming VR?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.720]   Well, some of these devices will have Wi-Fi
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.760]   and they'll have local memory,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.800]   where when they see a Wi-Fi hotspot that they can get on,
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.080]   they'll download a 900 megabyte asset package.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.320]   And then the only thing that will be streaming
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.880]   will be the positional information
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.920]   if you're in a shared metaverse or a shared reality.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.560]   So could I?
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.480]   Where you are and where they are, everyone else.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.000]   Could I buy a jump camera or make a jump camera?
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.200]   Put it right there and you could watch this show
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.480]   as we make it, as if you're sitting in the audience.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.200]   Yeah, very easily.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:39.680]   Is it a real time?
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.520]   It's just one other stream.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.320]   Can you do the stitching in real time?
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.920]   It's a warped image.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.880]   The stitching takes place on a platform
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.720]   that the cameras are connected to.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   So it has to be a pretty heavy-duty process.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.840]   It can work in real time.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.360]   It can work in real time.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.440]   It's one of the thoughts somebody next door had at the Pixel Core is theater.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:58.640]   Theater, yeah.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.520]   I thought Cirque du Soleil was an example, kind of a circus,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.640]   but it's theater also.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.280]   Characters are interacting with each other,
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.440]   but you can look around as they talk to each other.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.840]   Yeah, it's not strict rendering-based gaming VR
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.600]   where the characters are actually rendered characters in 3D.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.640]   It's more like surround photography,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.840]   where you only can participate in a point of view change.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.800]   In a way that's superior because you don't get the uncanny valley.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.640]   I'm looking at a real picture of a real person.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.520]   There's nothing like a real picture of a real person.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.560]   It's pretty it.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.840]   It's a remarkable experience.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.640]   I've come around.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.440]   Well, as the frame rate gets faster,
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.120]   the field of view gets wider, the resolution gets higher,
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.040]   the weight gets lower, and the power efficiency decreases as well.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.640]   The idea that you can have a personal device,
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   which is yours that you don't have to share,
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.520]   Right.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.360]   That you can bring everywhere in a bowling bag,
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.680]   makes it a very practical platform for people to experience
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.960]   of theater, learning.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.960]   I want to use it in the nursing home.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.200]   I just want to sit there in my chair and have a life
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.800]   without ever leaving there.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.720]   Well, this is a picture of the nursing home of the future.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.800]   That's what I think will all be like walling,
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.160]   just here consuming our-
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160]   But these are already hard.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.720]   There's no power in this because the phone does all the work.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.360]   It's just a lens.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.320]   It's very lightweight.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.200]   It's just a holder.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.640]   It's a lens apparatus.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.080]   You can get these for a buck if you use cardboard,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.920]   and this is $25.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.360]   The Gear VR is a little more pricey.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.800]   It's about $200.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.720]   Well, the Oculus, the high-end Oculus.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.400]   By the way, that's the Gear VR is Oculus.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.760]   It says power by Oculus.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:35.920]   Right.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.240]   Well, yeah, they've been collaborating with them to tweak all the software and everything else.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.960]   So it works well and doesn't burn up the phone.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:50.000]   And John Carmack has been very hands-on in all the really minutia of the micro-programming
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.520]   that has to go into making that work well.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.080]   Of course, the game designer from Ed who did Quake and Doomming.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.840]   He's a technology officer.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.120]   Come CTO over it.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.160]   He was so excited by this.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.320]   I want to work for you guys.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.600]   And he's been doing a great job.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.000]   And most of his talks from Oculus are online.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.440]   They're very technical.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.280]   So if you're into the technology of it,
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.520]   you can just watch these talks online and become very, very smart, very quick.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.400]   Jill, what do you think?
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   AR, VR, or both?
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.600]   So I have a problem with a lot of the technologies in that I have some vision issues
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.280]   that don't always allow it to work for me.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.560]   Same thing with 3D movies.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.120]   So sometimes that immersive experience while everybody around me is enjoying it,
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.800]   I'm kind of like squinting one eye.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.280]   You know what Jill?
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.240]   I'm trying to orient myself.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.360]   I have the same thing.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.680]   I had amblyopia, lazy eyes, a kid.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.040]   It was never corrected.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   I normally don't use both eyes.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.560]   I will use one or the other eye.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.480]   So I normally don't have stereo vision.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.320]   The eye doctor said, "You're a little bit cross-eyed.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.600]   This is when I was a kid."
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.000]   It's not like you're going to be in TV or movies or anything.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.360]   What happens is you compensate.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.480]   You learn how to compensate.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.040]   So I can.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.280]   I don't have traditional depth perception with stereo vision,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   but I can match these up because your eyes move, your head move,
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.600]   and your brain learns to do this.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.480]   And what's really weird for me, Jill, is when I first went to 3D movies,
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.800]   like Captain EO, remember that Disney?
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.680]   I couldn't see it.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.280]   And I've somehow trained my brain now that I can.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.440]   I can somehow see it.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.680]   And this stuff works for me fine.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.160]   That's great.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.480]   So maybe there is a way that your brain is amazingly malleable.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.240]   There's a VR app that has been designed to correct for
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.840]   amblyopia and strabismus and lazy eye and what's up ptosis.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.760]   And it actually works.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.720]   So there are.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.600]   It can be corrected.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.160]   A lot of therapeutic applications for VR for sensory and visual anomalies
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.440]   that actually have been proven and they work.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.200]   And they've been winning awards and prizes in the medical area.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.320]   So there's hope, Jill.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.920]   You and I are going to maybe someday.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.160]   I still don't necessarily enjoy it though.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.000]   So let me put that out there.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.360]   So for the same reasons 3D movies, I don't always find them enjoyable
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.200]   is because I don't necessarily feel like the experience it's providing me
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.120]   is greater than the experience I had before I had this extra layer.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.960]   That's normal, Jill.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.840]   That's correct.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.760]   3D movies suck.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.520]   Even if you can see them, they suck.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.920]   So let me just bring it back to the Cirque du Soleil example you were giving before.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.840]   I love movies.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.520]   I really like movies a lot.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.400]   And I want to see a movie that's well directed.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.840]   I don't want to be the director.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.760]   I don't want to decide where I'm going to look.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.040]   I don't want to explore.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.520]   I want that two hour movie to be tightly edited to say something in the way that
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.040]   the shots are composed and the order in which the things are shown to me.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.640]   So for me, I want my entertainment experiences to be
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.560]   to have less of my opinion in them.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.680]   I want somebody else who's very skilled at making them to make them for me.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.520]   Yeah, it's like that old thing where you could have a do it yourself mystery book.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.120]   And who wants to do that?
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.080]   Take me through a story.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.120]   I agree with you on that.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:01.680]   Right.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.000]   Right.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.400]   You know, when Google was announcing some of the new stuff for cardboard,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.640]   I got into a little discussion with people about using cardboard in the classroom.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.880]   And technology enthusiasts were very excited.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.440]   They all told me this would be wonderful technology.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:21.280]   It's very low cost and it would allow low income students to have field trips virtually that
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.320]   they've never had before.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.840]   And I was like, bullish.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.360]   I'm with you.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.720]   If you've ever if you've been in a low income classroom, I mean, come on, we don't have we
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.000]   don't have enough desks.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.120]   We have to share textbooks.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.560]   We don't have enough chairs.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.320]   The teachers wait for students to drop out to have enough chairs for everybody.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.880]   Like, you think we're going to have smartphones for these kids and then everybody's going to
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.400]   put their thing on including the professor, the instructor and the kids aren't kind of like
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.920]   start smacking each other in the back ahead.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.960]   I was like, this is just you're having unrealistic expectations because you're so in love with
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.760]   the technology.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.880]   I am so with you.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.920]   Joe, I disagree with that.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.960]   My uncle is a teacher specifically about technology and he is so psyched for this to
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.320]   become mainstream in the classroom.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.240]   This reminds me a lot of and I said this actually at the time of a lot of Silicon Valley
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.320]   initiatives where we're all excited about we're going to get tablets in every classroom.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:13.680]   And then we walk away and we don't give many instructional materials.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.960]   We don't give curricula.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.800]   We don't teach them how to use it.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.960]   It ends up gathering dust in the back of the class.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.480]   The devil is in the details.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.720]   It's more than just providing the technology.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:28.240]   And of course, cardboard is cheap, but you still have to have a $600 smartphone excited.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.360]   And that's not going to happen.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.400]   I wanted to read you a fact really quick about binocularity, the ability to see in 3D.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.280]   So a question often asks is how many people in the population can see in 3D?
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.680]   The answer varies from study to study, but one of the larger studies suggests about 3% of people
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.000]   cannot see binocularity at all.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.280]   A further 7% of people have some limited 3D vision and therefore about 90% of people have
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.640]   good 3D vision.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.040]   And with their many factors that affect this, there's not one single reason for these variations.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.320]   So there are a lot of us that just can't see in 3D or--
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.280]   10% is a big number.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.480]   It makes it hard.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.600]   And so they have a voice and--
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.200]   Wouldn't that be interesting if something
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.080]   I mean, if you're deaf or you're blind.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:12.640]   Right.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.960]   But wouldn't that be interesting if there was some technology that just swept the world and only
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.280]   and 10% of people couldn't just couldn't do it?
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.960]   There would be the have not.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.080]   Supposedly, magically, which is the one that Google invested heavily in, it beams the image
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.040]   right into your eye.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.640]   And they don't like to use that language.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.520]   No, that sounds painful.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.600]   But essentially--
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.240]   It solves that problem.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.280]   It solves that problem.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.640]   And you can dial it up all the way to being full VR or just AR.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.160]   So you're--
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:38.880]   Was it your uncle?
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.920]   My uncle, yeah.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.600]   He's the technologist, though, right?
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.760]   So he understands, is he doesn't need to be tripping.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   Exactly.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.120]   Exactly.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.480]   Now, but the kids love it.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.160]   They did an AR project.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.360]   And it was open house and the parents came in and held up an iPad in front of their students
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.760]   or in the kids picture and it came to life.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.640]   Oh, I loved that.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.280]   It was-- and they said the kids loved it, the parents loved it.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.440]   So he's really noodling around with stuff like that.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.320]   We did a demo.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.040]   And it's on the yesterday's new screensavers.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:05.920]   We get a chance to see it.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.760]   Have something called-- was it Spectre 3D?
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.560]   I think it was.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.920]   It's for the classroom.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.200]   It looks like a regular monitor.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.120]   And when you're looking at it, it looks fine.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.840]   But when you put on passive polarized glasses,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.240]   like the real D glasses in the movie theater,
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:24.720]   the machine has several cameras on the front of it that displayed us.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.720]   It senses you put on the cameras.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.760]   And it then goes into a 3D mode where you can, with a pen, pick up something,
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.560]   hold it out here, manipulate it, see it.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.920]   They did it as an example.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.280]   They took apart a heart.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.360]   We took the lungs off the heart, went into the heart,
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.560]   went into the valves, watched the valves move the vessels.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.520]   There it is.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.640]   It was remarkable.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.240]   If you haven't had a chance to see it,
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.640]   it's on the yesterday's new screensavers.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.600]   Is that you trying it?
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.520]   Yeah, this is actually on the show.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.200]   And what we were able to--
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.520]   he has figured out a way in the career of this to show it.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.160]   That's awesome.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.800]   Because normally this is one of the problems with VR is,
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.720]   unless you're in the helmet, you don't know what the hell.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.800]   So he's figured out some way to tape it that we can actually show me
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   lifting the heart out into space.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   And it's unbelievable.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:17.600]   Regular stereoscopy is being used with glasses.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.120]   It's not immersive VR.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.000]   It's not immersive.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.600]   This is kind of an AR experience.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.960]   So it's a limited field of view.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.360]   Right.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.000]   3D.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:24.240]   Right.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.760]   And you can interact with it as well.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.040]   And this is also for schools.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.040]   And he's apparently quite a few schools of--
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.720]   Well, it's not a cheap system.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.520]   It's a champion.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:31.920]   It's very--
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.960]   It's a Z space.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.440]   Z space.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:33.920]   That's it.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:34.720]   You know about it.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   But I was-- gosh, I was impressed by it.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.920]   And you can see kids getting engaged.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.200]   Whether it's better than--
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.040]   A textbook.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.680]   A textbook.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.240]   I don't know.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.400]   But boy, if you get-- see, that's what it looks like.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.760]   It's a 3D display without the glasses.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.600]   But when you have the glasses on, it looks like this.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.520]   And Jill, I'm like you.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.320]   I don't see 3D.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.520]   And I saw this clear.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.760]   Boy, coming right at me, it was amazing.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.880]   There are a lot of personal adjustments that can be made
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   in the display system to accommodate people
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.440]   that have varying levels of 3D vision support.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:12.080]   This one size fits all excitement that everybody has.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.280]   It's very early, and it's anomalous in its inception.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   But as the systems get more advanced,
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.560]   they will go through a calibration mode initially
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.840]   for you, the single user, that will take maybe a minute.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.280]   And then everything that is served to you visually afterwards
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.800]   will have a pre-accommodation for your own particular type
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.920]   of visual sense.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.440]   So it could get better and better.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.880]   Yeah, none of that's going on right now.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.640]   All that calibration stuff that has to happen--
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.520]   It feels primitive.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.160]   In fact, even when you buy the Galaxy Gear VR
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.080]   for $0.0 bucks, it says Innovator Edition.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.360]   They're very clear.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.000]   This is a--
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.880]   It's a dev kit.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.000]   It's a dev kit.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.280]   Except I'm not going to do any dev.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.120]   It's really more for me like an amusement park.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.960]   But it is pretty impressive.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.560]   Even though you can see the screen door effect,
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.640]   because you can see pixels, you're really close.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.320]   And this is a very-- this is a 577 DPI display on my Galaxy S6.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.160]   But you still see the pixels on here.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.720]   I don't know.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.520]   Maybe they're not using--
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.640]   Had to--
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   At display week last week was an all-week conference
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.360]   about display technology in San Jose.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.640]   So all the big players were there.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.760]   I love that you hear about that.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.600]   Yeah, there was a 4K smartphone display
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.520]   where you had all 4K pixels available to you.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.920]   And so they say that the VR systems,
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.160]   even this kind of VR system like you're talking about--
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:28.720]   Like the cardboard.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.960]   --in you shove a 4K display in there,
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.240]   then you're at the limit of the clarity of the optics.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.080]   So if you can add glass optics or better optics in there,
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.640]   you can really see all 4K of those pixels.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.560]   And that makes a really big perceptual difference.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.360]   Also, at display week was a new type of holographic backlighting,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.200]   which was a physics problem that was unsolvable for years.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.920]   Is they figured out how to do 3D projection holograms.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.240]   But they required some kind of holographic backlighting
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:03.520]   that they can only make just 5 or 10 centimeters in a square.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.280]   And now they can make these new backlights almost any size
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.440]   by using a nanomolecular construction
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.840]   of the atoms of the particular holographic substrate.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.440]   I feel like we're really at a breakthrough point.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.840]   There's so much going on in the display field
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.120]   that what nobody's talking about in the VR business
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:28.560]   is that all these display technologies that you see today
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.560]   and you'll have next year, or we'll start shipping next year,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.400]   the year after, will be leapfrogged within three or four years
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.680]   by Moore's Law on a logarithmic curve.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.720]   You can thank me, by the way.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.640]   I just bought Apple's 5K iMac.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.440]   So it's because of me that you're getting this better display
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.760]   resolution, because of course, as soon as I buy something,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.880]   it's outmoded instantly.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.280]   Right.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.240]   So what's passed 4K?
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.520]   What's the next thing? Is it 8K?
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.960]   8K, 16K.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.920]   6K, right.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.480]   Why not?
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.720]   But I feel like 577 DPI on the Galaxy S6.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.320]   I'm never going to see it dot on it.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.120]   So when he was talking about magically retinal projection
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:12.400]   systems, nanodisplays, plasmonic displays are coming.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:12.400]   Wow.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.360]   The plasmonic effect is where, if you look at it like a blue,
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.560]   beautiful blue butterfly, it's just gorgeous the way it
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.680]   reflects light.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.480]   But if you put it under a microscope, the butterflies wings
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.440]   are actually gray.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.960]   There's no color in them at all.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.440]   Oh, because they're little prisms.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.480]   Because they are cut so finely by nature that they're at an
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.120]   atomic level that they're aligned, the atoms are aligned,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.000]   that it breaks up light and it projects blue and other.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.200]   So Qualcomm has a whole display division based on what's called
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.880]   the mirror-sol display.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.360]   And that is the plasmonic display.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.480]   And we will be seeing plasmonic displays in our laptops.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.600]   How do you have the color?
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.000]   You change it.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.200]   It uses available light.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.640]   And then rotate the-- so it's a reflective display.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:27:59.760]   Right.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.080]   And you rotate the prism--
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.800]   Or it can be transparent.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.440]   It addresses the molecular alignment of the display
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.080]   atoms, basically driving them from the edges.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.120]   Oh, brave new world that has such displays in it.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.040]   With this, you'll be able to have a contact lens, which is an AR
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.400]   overlay or a exclusive contact lens.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.520]   That's what we want.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.120]   There's a company called Inovega.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.920]   And they're already working on a contact lens, which has--
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.840]   So it would be a passive receiver.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.400]   And the incoming light would modify--
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.880]   Well, the way Inovega works is that particular contact lens
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.120]   is polarized.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.960]   And it also has a very special focal area to accommodate a
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.520]   very, very close display.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.480]   So if you have a super high resolution display, but it's
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.120]   only a quarter of an inch or a half an inch from your eye,
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.200]   you can't focus on it without having traditional
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.640]   columnating optics, which is glass, compressed, many little
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.600]   lenses, adds a lot of weight, and everything else.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.960]   So by using the contact lens, it gives you this very close
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.840]   focus area, allows you to focus on that display very close to
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:08.720]   the eye.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.520]   And you can still see everything else in your field of view.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.800]   Wait, I can wear something on my eye that I can focus on.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.400]   That allows you to focus at a display very close, like in
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:18.960]   a pair of glasses.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.400]   But it wouldn't appear that way, probably.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.600]   It'd appear like it's out here.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.360]   It's a huge resolution.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.960]   It overlays your complete field of view.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.000]   Now how do you feel, Jill?
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.880]   Now that's what you want.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.240]   A new 3D.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.000]   You just put these contact lenses on.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:32.800]   It's called Inovega.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.160]   I don't think I'll take that.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   That sounds awesome.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.120]   It makes those smart contact lenses.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.680]   I was also really excited about the--
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.600]   remember that Google was working.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.400]   Google XLabs was working on contact lenses that would
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:48.120]   inject people with the proper amount of glucose if they
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.880]   were diabetic.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.400]   Right.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.000]   So it wouldn't inject your contact.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.760]   It would sense them.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.520]   It would sense it.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.600]   It was sensing your glucose levels through your--
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.480]   So you could do something.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.040]   --the liquid and the tears in your eyes.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.000]   That's right.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.600]   Yeah, the scientist doing that was Babak Parvis.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.600]   He came out at the University of Washington.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.440]   He was one of the lead scientists for Google Glass for a
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.240]   while.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.280]   And I think he's left Google, and he went back into academia.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.240]   But his prototype for a glass-based contact lens also had
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.320]   all these other applications that they could use.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.160]   So it's not just going to sense--
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.160]   have all these cool AR features.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.680]   It's also going to tell me if I need to get a little insulin.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.120]   Right.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.920]   It can check blood sugar, heart rate, pulse, all sorts
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:30.680]   of other things.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.160]   Jilly, that's pretty exciting.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.240]   You're not going to have to wear basis watch much longer.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.800]   Yeah, no, I'm all about that.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.960]   I mean, some of the most exciting stuff that was at CES this
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.080]   year for me were very simple adhesive bandages.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.240]   They're already being used by some hospitals wherein they
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.440]   have sensors in them that read your basic vital signs.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.280]   They detect if you fall.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.200]   And it's being used.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.760]   It's called Health Patch.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:58.800]   And it's being used by hospitals when they have a patient
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.400]   who's ready to be discharged.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.920]   But they don't want to discharge to the patient yet because
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.600]   there's something they want to monitor.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.200]   Now, if you stay in the hospital, your bill is going to go up
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.920]   tens of thousands of dollars every day that you're there.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.040]   If the doctors can send you home, your care team can still
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.000]   monitor you remotely.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:15.920]   They see a spike.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.800]   They see a change.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:17.800]   They say, come back in.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.000]   We want to check something out.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.480]   That allows you to go home, live your life.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:25.200]   I believe that the Health Patch wears for about two to three
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:25.800]   days.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.120]   So it's just a simple adhesive bandage.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   It goes right on.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.560]   It can survive through the shower.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.720]   It's very comfortable.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.400]   I think this is much, much, much better wearable technology
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.800]   than strapping on a watch that you didn't really know what
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.080]   you were expecting it to do in the first place.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:45.760]   So maybe that's the answer to the nitpicks on the Apple watches.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.120]   This is a primitive version we're going to learn about the
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.800]   kinds of things we want to know.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.600]   And then we'll get better and better at measuring it.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.520]   That's one of the things Apple's doing that's very interesting
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520]   is the research kit stuff.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.200]   Where they're asking for the phone, too.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.160]   Yeah, I think that--
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.000]   So that's exciting.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.240]   And really, maybe Apple's just saying, look, we're going to
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240]   take the long view on this.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.800]   This is not the final product by any means.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.680]   Any more than Gear VR is the final product for VR.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.480]   We're going to take a break.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.080]   Jill, I know you only have about 10 more minutes.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.520]   We're going to try to get this done before you have to run.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.280]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.480]   Start building your new website today at Squarespace.
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.080]   What a beautiful place.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.720]   You know, it's so easy to create a website.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.560]   It kind of breaks my heart because I just spent a lot of
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.800]   money for our new website.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.080]   And I look at what you can do with Squarespace.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.400]   It's mobile responsive.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.600]   That's what you want nowadays.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.760]   You don't want a separate mobile site and a separate desktop
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:41.960]   site.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.320]   You want your site to respond to the size of the screen and
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:49.440]   look great no matter where people are looking at it.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.800]   Sites look professionally designed even if you don't
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.800]   know anything, even if you don't know any coding.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.840]   Although if you are a coder, they have a great
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.840]   developers platform.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.600]   You're going to start by choosing your template.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.000]   And by the way, Squarespace offers you this free access.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.160]   For the first two weeks, you can just have the run of the
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.520]   place, even import data from your old sites.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.440]   You can see how it would look.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.960]   Squarespace.com, just press that get started button.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.880]   And by the way, this is hosting plus software state of the
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:15.960]   art hosting.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.160]   Nobody does such a good job to ensure your stability and
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.160]   your security I should add.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.040]   If you're running your own website, you've got a
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.560]   constantly monitored for security flaws.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.840]   You don't have to with Squarespace.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.440]   They do it for you.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.320]   And it's trusted by so many people.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.960]   Some of the biggest brands in the world, their commerce, is
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.520]   second to none.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.720]   So many nice features.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.280]   It all starts at $8 a month.

[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.120]   this.

[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.600]   And all I ask is when you do sign up for Squarespace, and I
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.680]   know you will, you use the Africa Twitch.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.200]   So you get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.680]   It is the place to build your store, to build your brand,
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.240]   to put your portfolio, or even just a personal blog.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:07.920]   Squarespace.com, don't forget when you buy it, you use the
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.760]   Africa Twitch, 10% off.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:14.280]   I saw you looking at this, Greg.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.040]   Is this--
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.800]   So I wanted to show you this while I was here.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.960]   OK, that's President Obama.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.600]   And now if you--
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.000]   wait a minute, what's going on here?
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.280]   Let's move it down a little bit.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.480]   What is going on here?
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.200]   He's looking at me and talking about--
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.680]   He monitors your face.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.920]   Oh, as soon as he sees me.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:33.600]   Right, so you talking, moving your head around.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:39.040]   That is weird, and you could change his voice, too.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:39.920]   What is this called?
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.600]   So this is Pocket Avatars.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.720]   Pocket Avatars.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.720]   It's an app that runs on the smartphone.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.360]   Does it work on iOS only?
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.080]   Or this is an Android phone?
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.840]   Yeah, I don't know about iOS, because I don't have an Apple
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:51.360]   phone.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.760]   That's right now, I'm going to install this.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.920]   And then there's all these other avatars that I have here
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.120]   that I downloaded.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.800]   So now, this is just a toy, though.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.120]   Or what is the larger--
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.280]   Hey, this is Ronald Reagan.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.760]   Ronald Reagan?
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.240]   What is it?
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:05.960]   Hey, Ronnie.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.000]   Hey!
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.040]   Oh, hey, wait a minute.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.680]   He's saying what I'm saying.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.880]   That's how Dev Noll worked.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.360]   That's right.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.800]   I would talk and the lips would flap.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:14.280]   Wow.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.120]   So this is really--
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:15.920]   It really works.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920]   Hello.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.840]   [LAUGHING]
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.000]   Oh, I'm going to be Ronald Reagan.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.880]   I'm going to send a note to Elisa.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.840]   [LAUGHING]
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.680]   That's great.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.400]   She'll kill you.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.880]   And you were looking at this where Alady--
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.280]   this is a Kickstarter project.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.600]   Is this like cardboard or--
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.240]   Where Alady's a different kind of lens,
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.760]   a Fresnel lens that is constructed to give you
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.400]   150 degree field of view.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.120]   Very similar to--
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.120]   Oh, you've not seen my screen.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.440]   --this device, but with a different kind of lens
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.240]   or a cheap, inexpensive manufacturer.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:51.640]   If Fresnel is the kind of lenses they use on street lights
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:55.320]   and stop lights, they're very cheap
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.360]   because you're not grinding a smooth lens.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.520]   You're just using--
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.400]   But doesn't that look crappy?
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.440]   No, it looks fantastic, as a matter of fact.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.000]   I ran into David Smith, the founder of the company.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.280]   And it's so impressive that one of his long-term friends--
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.760]   and someone I used to work with, Michael Jones, who's
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.800]   been at Google for years at Google Ventures,
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.120]   agreed to be CEO of the company.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.880]   So instead of stereo vision, you only have--
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.680]   it's two lenses, you only have one lens.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.320]   Is that right or--
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.240]   No, it has two lenses.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:25.920]   It has two.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.920]   They're just made in a way where they're inexpensive
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.480]   and they give you a huge field of view without class optics.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.960]   So you would shove your smartphone in it
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.760]   just like you would any other lens apparatus.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.640]   And it would just give you much, much wider field of view
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.560]   for VR, which is--
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.760]   VR used to be a very narrow field of view technology.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.680]   And now it's wider.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.440]   But wide field of view is very expensive to make in optics.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.600]   And this is very, very inexpensive.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.320]   So it--
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.920]   Is this 180 degrees?
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.880]   Is it-- why--
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.760]   150.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.440]   150 degrees, which is a lot.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.800]   That's almost all the way around.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.560]   Yeah, it's the largest field of view
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.120]   for any kind of visor or visor-based attachment
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.840]   for a VR smartphone.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.280]   Imagine movies in this.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.440]   I mean, iMacs is only 110 degrees, right?
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.720]   This is 150 degrees.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.720]   So this would consume your-- pretty much all of your--
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.960]   It's very satisfying to put it on and try it.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.840]   I mean, you really feel like you're someplace else
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.240]   the second you put it on.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.240]   And--
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.600]   Is this a Kickstarter?
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.480]   So these are the lenses.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.160]   Yeah, they raised all their money.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.880]   They attracted a great CEO at a Google Ventures.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.480]   What do you see this being for?
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.560]   Just-- you won't want to walk around wearing these things.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.400]   You'd get a photo of your phone in it.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.720]   It's just a frame.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.160]   Oh, I get it.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.560]   Yeah, it's just a frame.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.760]   And it--
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.040]   But you'd have special software--
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.960]   Yeah, it has all these specifications
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.560]   that blow past all the other wearable frames.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.440]   So really, instead of going to an iMacs theater,
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.080]   I could get the iMacs experience by wearing this with my phone.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.520]   I can't-- I don't have to move my head.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.960]   I mean, I'm just looking at it, right?
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.000]   So there's Alan Kay and Mark Bolas are all very excited
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.720]   about these are two leading people in the tech industry.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.640]   Mark Bolas is considered one of the fathers of VR.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.160]   And he teaches at USC.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.960]   He's been a friend of mine for a long time.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.400]   I'm doing--
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.640]   I'm sure I quite get this.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.600]   So what is it looking like?
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   It's just a--
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.600]   All by heart.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.600]   I love by heart.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.640]   Yeah, it's just a new twist on lenses that just popped up
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.360]   over the last couple of months.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.480]   And they raised all the money for their Kickstarter.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.000]   Is it a VR-like experience?
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.320]   You'd use your regular phone using stereopsis.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.200]   And you would just shove it into this different lens
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.400]   configuration and would give you much wider field of view.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.040]   And it's very light.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.000]   It looks a lot lighter than--
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:50.840]   Yeah, I mean, the phone is--
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.880]   It's a little plastic 3D printed frame.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.640]   And there you see the little Fresnel ridges.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.200]   Yeah, you can see the Fresnel lines in it,
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.440]   but not when you put it on.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.600]   Interesting.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.680]   So they can make this cheaply, too.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.800]   Yeah, I mean, that's really what's happening in the VR
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.320]   industry is there's lots of little pop-up startups
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:12.600]   and Kickstarter's that are innovating various little areas
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.080]   of it.
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.440]   It's not just Oculus doing all the work.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.080]   And the technology, some of these companies
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.320]   are Kickstarter for a little while.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.960]   And then they get acquired very quietly by Google or Apple.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.040]   And then they're gone.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.280]   That's what I find fascinating.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.440]   This is becoming a battleground for the big,
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.840]   the really big guys.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.000]   They all see this as the next big--
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.120]   Yeah, a lot of Soren D's been going on in the dark in labs
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.040]   for years and mostly universities.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.320]   USC has got some of the top VR researchers working there
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.080]   now, Scott Fisher and Mark Bolas and Noni de la Pena,
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:54.520]   who did the virtual Assyria and the virtual news gathering demos.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.960]   And she's been called the Godmother of VR.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.240]   It's funny to hear all these familial associations
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.720]   of people associated with VR.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.480]   I was mentored by Mort Heilig, who's the grandfather of VR.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.640]   And then--
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.800]   What happened in Jaren Lanier?
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.560]   Jaren Lanier was considered the--
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.240]   the son of VR.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.000]   He kind of bowed out, didn't he?
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.280]   I mean, he kind of gave up on it all.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.400]   He was one of the '90s, one of the--
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.280]   Well, we have two big VR panels at SIGGRAPH this summer.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.480]   And he's on one of them.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.680]   And I'm producing the other one with Jackie Morrie
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.280]   from the form of USC.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.600]   I have to say I've come around 100%.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:36.840]   It's not exclusive.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.640]   AR is useful for some things.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.360]   VR for other things, right?
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.280]   Well, as a matter of fact, tomorrow the augmented world's
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.840]   expo starts in Santa Clara for three days.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.440]   And it's going to be a really big event.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.400]   Well, that has an excellent acronym.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.080]   Aww.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:50.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   All 2015.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.680]   So that's still open registration.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.080]   And they were mostly an AR event,
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.600]   but now they're integrating VR.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.720]   And they've doubled or tripled in size in one year.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.400]   And a lot of the pioneers and a lot of the head researchers
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.720]   from all the big companies are going to be there.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.880]   AWE 2015.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.720]   So I'll be heading to that tomorrow.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.880]   What is their thought--
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.160]   what is the general consensus on Microsoft's HoloLens, which
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.680]   is an augmented reality device?
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.440]   I think everyone's thrilled that they're a player
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.280]   and that Alex Kippman, who's one of their lead scientists,
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.200]   has been actively out there promoting and talking
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.000]   about it at the HoloLens event.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.880]   And Microsoft is going to bring all of their own smarts
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.760]   to the field.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.880]   And whatever innovations they have
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.800]   will become known to everybody, just
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.360]   like when Google opens their doors and reveals products
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.280]   and ideas and technologies.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.200]   So they're going to be selling product, just like everyone
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:51.680]   else's.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.040]   I want to go down to this.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.040]   This looks like a great product.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:54.300]   It is.
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:55.560]   It's going to be exciting.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.360]   It's one of the better conferences
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.640]   that I've been going to over the last number of years.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.920]   It seems very homey and very familial.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.080]   Everybody knows each other.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.280]   All the top scientists show up.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.120]   And they're either on panels or hanging around.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.760]   And the VR scene, as far as conferences,
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.680]   has been taken over by the meetups.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.880]   So you've got the Silicon Valley VR conference, which
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.000]   just happened two weeks ago.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.480]   It was a very big event.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:28.480]   And then LA VR is a big meetup, which is coming.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.800]   The meetups have been growing and doubling in size
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.000]   from one meetup to the next.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:33.480]   Very interesting.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.560]   The last one was about 3,000 people in Los Angeles.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.000]   And everyone is at the meetups as well.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.080]   So it's really very, very hot right now.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.040]   I predicted it'll cool off for a little bit.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.440]   You know, I see that Jerry Ellsworth's
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.640]   going to be a speaker.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:51.800]   Yeah, I just saw her at Maker Fair.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.680]   How is she doing with her Cast AR,
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.960]   which is an interesting idea?
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.640]   It's not exactly augmented reality.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.520]   You need a playing field that the cameras--
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.880]   I love to the Cast AR.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.880]   It's like for gaming or--
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.920]   it's basically a frame that tracks your position.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.200]   And it also has two stereoscopic projectors,
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.800]   micro projectors on it.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.520]   And it needs a retroreflective material to work.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.360]   So you can build a dollhouse out of this retroreflective
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:21.840]   material.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.040]   You can just have like a scrim that's hanging up.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:29.920]   And it will project stereoscopic imagery in front of you.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.520]   And as you turn your head, it'll move around
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.040]   and track your head.
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.200]   So if you're using a game just like the Z space,
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.280]   it works a lot like the Z space, where you put this light headset
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.160]   on and you're not occluded and there aren't lenses in it,
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.640]   using your real eyes to look out into the real world.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.560]   I see Tim on this for us.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.080]   And I'm really thrilled that it's gotten well for her.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.680]   So the idea is that it'll be inexpensive and it'll
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.440]   be something you could buy for kids at Christmas
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.120]   and will have all these apps and all these little things that
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.960]   come with it that you can project on.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.200]   All these companies succeed.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.840]   That's an interesting question.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.000]   They're all seem like there's different takes--
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.280]   They're little bits of pieces, like little features,
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.120]   but not nothing all encompassing for one platform at all.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.040]   I mean, I could see this being the toy of the year 2018
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.680]   or whatever.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.280]   But it feels more like a toy a little bit in the way
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.760]   that this is being used.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:27.480]   And yet they did show designers using it and so forth.
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.880]   My dad had an office in the toy building in New York
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.960]   when I was all the--
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.000]   Nothing wrong with the toy.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.520]   I was old enough to crawl.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.520]   I was crawling around in the Hasbro show.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.280]   Here's a video of this guy's using it basically
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:38.280]   as a desktop UI.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.120]   I mean, it's his windows.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.880]   Exactly.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:47.600]   So you can use it for complex model intuition
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.040]   and understanding and analysis.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.760]   So if you have 3D data and you're displaying it
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:54.520]   in a three dimensional context, you can actually--
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.480]   Get one for every member of the day.
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.680]   You snore each other, put your glasses on.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.400]   But that's what I like about AR is you don't ignore each other.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.640]   You still see everything that's going on in the room here.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.880]   So Cast AR has moved down to Mountain View.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.240]   Oh, good.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.800]   So they're in town now.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.000]   Boy, I tell you, the product looks very polished.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]   Yeah, it's very polished.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:13.400]   Yeah, it's very polished.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.960]   She has hot glued everything together.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.480]   Yeah, no.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.000]   That's what we saw.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:16.560]   It's improved.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.840]   They're getting cars.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.800]   In fact, I noticed the picture she's using,
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.240]   her publicity shot is from the Twit cottage.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.440]   Yeah, she did a great triangulation with you.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.600]   She is great.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.760]   Jill, do you need to get out of here?
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.480]   I think you do.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.360]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   I got to wrap up.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.280]   That's quite all right.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.840]   You're on East Coast time.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.320]   Great to see you at Jill E. Duffy on Twitter.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.000]   And of course, PC Magazine.com.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.920]   We see Jill a lot on the Technos tonight and other shows.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.720]   Always great to have you on here.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.240]   I appreciate it.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:44.760]   Thank you, Jill.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:45.600]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.360]   We're a good talk to you.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.040]   Thanks, Jill.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:47.360]   All right.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:47.800]   Take care.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   Take care.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.480]   Bye bye.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.280]   Bye bye.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.040]   Let's take a little break.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:51.720]   We'll come back.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.800]   There's some little bits and pieces, kind of the seeds
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.880]   and the stems, the shake that's gone down to the bottom
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.920]   of the show.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:00.360]   And we'll get to that in just a little bit.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360]   But first, let me tell you about my mattress.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.240]   Casper.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.680]   You know Casper.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.320]   Casper makes an amazing premium mattress in the US
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.520]   for a fraction of the cost.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.920]   And because they're selling it direct to you,
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.920]   they don't have the showroom.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.480]   They don't have resellers.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.000]   You can get a great twin mattress for $500, a king size,
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.880]   all the way up to the top $950.
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.880]   In a minute, I want to tell you how you can save even more.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:27.600]   But the question, a lot of people ask when I mention this
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.280]   and how much we love our Casper mattress,
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.040]   I set one to my son in college, is how can you tell
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.120]   if you're going to like this mattress before you buy it?
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:37.840]   You don't have to.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.240]   See, this is a problem with the way people buy mattresses today.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.760]   You go to a mattress showroom, you lie on it for five minutes,
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.960]   and you say, yeah, I'll sleep on that for the next 10 years.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.440]   That is not the way to do it.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.440]   With Casper, you get 100 days, or maybe I should say 100 nights,
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.960]   to sleep on the Casper mattress, to see if you like it.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.360]   And no questions asked.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.720]   Painless returns if you don't.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:00.280]   So there's no risk for you at all.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.520]   It comes in a box.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.960]   You saw the size of the box for a queen size mattress.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.040]   That's the other beauty part.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.720]   And that's why we got it for my son,
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.800]   because he didn't have any way to get a mattress up
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.760]   to the third floor of his dorm.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.680]   But we could easily get the box up there.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.360]   The UPS guy brought it.
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.680]   That's so cool.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.440]   So well made.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]   They're fresh.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.960]   They're cool at night.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.840]   You've got a combination of memory foam and latex
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.080]   that give you just the right sink and bounce.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.640]   It's firm, but it gives.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:33.920]   And it's very relaxing.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.320]   Even Aussie, you can see Aussie loves our Casper mattress.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.640]   I want you to try it.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.800]   They're made in the USA.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]   They're very affordable.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.560]   In fact, we're going to save you $50 right now
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.040]   if you go to Casper.com/twit.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.440]   $50 off any mattress, Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.280]   Use the promo code TWIT.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.520]   What was the-- it's just talking with Lisa.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:03.400]   Got some kids going off to college.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.080]   I remember where this was.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.280]   And they said, bring a mattress.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:06.920]   I said, wait a minute.
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:09.040]   Don't they furnish the dorm room?
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:09.640]   Yeah, they do.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.800]   But they tell you the mattresses are so god awful.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.720]   You're going to want to bring your own.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720]   I said, what happens to the mattress that was in there?
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.080]   They said, they literally throw it out
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:20.400]   and hope you leave your Casper there.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.760]   So we're sending a Casper.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.720]   I forgot who this is, but we're sending a Casper along with them
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.920]   as they go to college in the fall.
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:27.240]   You might want to consider the same if you've
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.760]   got a student entering school in the fall.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.000]   C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.320]   Use the promo code TWIT.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.640]   It is a great mattress.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640]   It's the better way to go.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.800]   Casper.com.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.480]   Leo Laport, we've got Steve Kovac from Business Insider here.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.440]   We've got Greg Panos.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.360]   It's been a great resource talking about VI.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.600]   I knew we wanted to get you on because I wanted--
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.160]   we've had you on triangulation if you
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.720]   want to see more of Greg, a whole triangulation episode
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.720]   with Greg a couple of years ago.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.880]   And at NEB.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:55.720]   It was at NEB.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.920]   That's right.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.360]   But I feel like we're on the cusp of something very exciting
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.440]   happening.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.520]   And I only recently got it with the HoloLens.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.440]   I started to say, wow, this is interesting.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.080]   And now this--
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.800]   so what is Oct?
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.800]   Do you know what Oculus is going to announce this week?
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.640]   Well, they're talking more about the controllers
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.360]   that they don't have.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.920]   The interesting thing about the valve prototype that
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.480]   created what's called the Lighthouse controller, which
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.280]   is a laser infrared scanner that bays the room in structured
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.600]   light and then allows the sensors on the visor
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.160]   to know exactly where it is in three dimensional space
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.440]   in a very large room.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.320]   So I can wear the Oculus and move around.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:45.840]   And now the virtual character I'm playing inside the rift
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.720]   moves with me.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.800]   Or your point of view.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.160]   But more than that, how do we walk?
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.320]   And then, by the way, I've never got sicker than in my life
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:54.960]   than doing this.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:57.720]   I put on a rift, and I had some controllers in my hand.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.240]   And I was shooting a gun, and I was running through the
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.400]   underbrush.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:05.720]   And it was the most fun I've ever had until I practically puked
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.520]   my guts out.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.080]   Your body's saying, no, no, you're not going anywhere.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.720]   And yet your eyes and your feeling like you're running.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.720]   Well, the new Oculus, the Crescent Bay, I believe it is.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.720]   It is really high resolution, a very wide field of view.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.080]   It helps a lot.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.320]   I mean, really, simulation sickness that people have has to
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.320]   do with resolution.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.320]   It's not uncommon.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320]   Update rate, motion disparity.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.320]   How do you fix the motion disparity?
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.960]   Well, they're all solvable problems.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.040]   Latency, reduced latency.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.640]   The tracking device, increased the accuracy of the tracking
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.040]   device.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.560]   The rendering, responding faster to the positional
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.520]   information, will solve a lot of that for a lot of people.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.080]   And as they get closer and closer and closer to zero in terms
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.600]   of latency, then you really have a hard time believing that
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.480]   you're in anything but a real world.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:02.720]   So the rift, they've already said, will require a fairly
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.720]   high-end gaming quality PC to go along with it.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.960]   They haven't given a price yet for the rift.
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:11.000]   But I think they said $1,500 for the PC plus the rift, which
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.120]   means $500 for the rift.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.560]   And you're saying that they will add, besides this
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:20.160]   aluminum-room style projector, they're going to add, will
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:20.880]   they have little--
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:23.360]   because I've had controllers tied.
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:25.680]   And she seemed as that with the two controllers that
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.520]   represent your hands.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.040]   So the HCC--
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.760]   So on your hands, they don't know where your hands are.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.760]   Yeah, it's really neat, too.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760]   You feel like you're manipulating stuff at that time.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.600]   The HCC controllers have--
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:38.440]   They have infrared receivers, infrared lenses on them.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.240]   And they're tracking the light in the room.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:42.160]   That's what blew me away, better than Oculus.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.240]   And the light in the room is being projected by a very
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.440]   special infrared transmitter that's transmitting a hollow
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.360]   deck like grip pattern in the room that you can't see.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.920]   Until you run up to a wall, the grid pops up in front of you
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.320]   so you don't put your face.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.960]   There's another company called Sixth Sense.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.840]   And they have some really accurate trackers, too, that
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.560]   use magnetic tracking.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.160]   So it creates a magnetic field.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.520]   And they have special coils in there that are also tracking.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:09.000]   It's very, very high accuracy, the magnetic tracking.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.640]   And then the light field tracking, obviously,
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:15.720]   is cheaper to make and less expensive.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.600]   But it's also pretty high accuracy.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.600]   If you were going to pick a winner--
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:22.840]   because I do think that there will be winners and losers in
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.040]   this.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.880]   It's the new console wars, at least for gaming.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:25.880]   Kind of is, isn't it?
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.320]   It's the same--
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.120]   And at that price, you've got to choose one.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.480]   You can't.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.000]   So is Valve's Oculus Rift--
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.280]   is what Gabe Nool is doing on Oculus Rift?
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.520]   It's interesting, because Valve, Jerry Ellsworth, was
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.040]   working for Valve when she developed Cast AR.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.520]   She said, can I take this with me?
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.080]   Because you just fired me.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.280]   And she tells me that Gabe Nool said, yeah, go ahead,
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:44.080]   take it with you.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:47.440]   So the Vive is what Valve is developing.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.760]   And that's the HTC one, right?
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.000]   Right.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.520]   And they partner with HTC on that.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.560]   And they are starting to ship the dev kits now.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.640]   Some developers are getting it.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.360]   So everyone I know that's tried the Vive,
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.080]   it has been really impressed.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:02.960]   It blew me-- compared to Oculus, I've tried them both.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.440]   It's better.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.480]   Vive is-- the optics are not as good.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.000]   But just the feeling that a presence at your eyes,
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:09.840]   virtual world is there.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.000]   So here's the interesting thing.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.560]   I mean, you just in a span of a couple of months
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:18.400]   got a chance to try both state of the yard systems.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.360]   In six months and in a year, these systems,
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.960]   the scientists that are producing them,
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.080]   will have even better prototypes.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.680]   So it has to stop at some point where they say,
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.360]   let's produce a product, let's freeze the design.
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:32.840]   We're still in that.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   Even though we know in six months,
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.720]   the resolution is going to be double again,
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.360]   the motion latency will be divided in half.
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.760]   And once it gets to a point where people aren't getting sick,
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.440]   they all love it, they're all enjoying it,
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.040]   then they'll be able to say, oh, OK, let's release a product.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.400]   Now it's a product.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.880]   HTC will have theirs the end of the year, they said.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.080]   Oh, wait, I wish it was the company they had more.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.840]   The more hand-wearing that delays it, the better.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.080]   Because then the product is going to be closer
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:53:59.920]   to the human sensory system.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.120]   But they have the valve backing them
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:05.080]   as your partner with them rather is so huge.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:05.600]   Right.
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.240]   Because I don't feel like HTC has much life left to do.
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:08.760]   No.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.800]   I notice you're using an HTC One, which I love.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.640]   Great to be with you.
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.800]   Nobody bought it.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.800]   So it's got great speakers.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:16.840]   I know.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.600]   So I hope-- I mean, maybe this will-- they'll
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.200]   be a rebirth of HTC to the five.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.920]   I'll show you a little trick.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:25.040]   No.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.160]   I'm going to just take a little--
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.560]   They do some interesting things with the sense--
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:31.360]   Quick little pictures and all of that.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.800]   So by the way, you didn't mention this,
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:36.360]   the Pocket Avatars is an Intel software.
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:36.960]   Right.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:37.680]   Comes from Intel.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.000]   OK.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.400]   So here, I just took a picture with a new app called--
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:44.480]   Did some breakthrough happen in this space?
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.240]   Because all of a sudden, there's 800 apps that take your picture,
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:48.880]   mold it, mold it.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:49.880]   Look at that.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.520]   Make you talk.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.000]   So it's a--
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.840]   Ah!
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.760]   It's a computer vision.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.720]   You're gluing me.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.560]   I didn't get you right.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.840]   But normally you could rotate around me.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.360]   It's a computer vision app that looks at your face,
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:05.400]   decides on where it's going to place anchor points,
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.640]   and then builds a 3D model of your face,
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.680]   and then remaps the image onto the anchor points.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.560]   It's called scene, S-E-E-N-E.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.960]   And if you practice with it, you can--
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.840]   I could do the same thing.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.920]   Let me see here.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.520]   Let's compare this.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.960]   Now, don't move, Greg.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.040]   What happens?
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.480]   This comes with the Samsung Galaxy S6.
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:32.480]   And what you do is you rotate around the person--
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:32.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.640]   I'm going the wrong way.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:36.640]   You rotate around the person so that it gets--
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.040]   it's basically making a movie, I guess, of the whole thing.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.320]   And it's building up this 3D model.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.080]   And then you can-- I don't know if I'm doing this right.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.520]   I have to walk around you to do it.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:46.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.880]   But it's really effective.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:49.040]   It's a surprisingly effective--
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:50.840]   This is a subset of that.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.480]   All of this is consumer level stuff that's kind of mind-boggling.
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.920]   But again, who's going to be the winner?
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.320]   Do we know?
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.480]   Do you like-- do you think Valve?
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.560]   I think HTC has just a slight leg up because--
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.600]   But Valve's going to be gaming and gaming only, right?
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.600]   Because that's the fact that--
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.560]   So if you want to look platform-wise longer view, maybe Oculus.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:12.000]   I don't know.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.760]   If you can't bet against Google--
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.320]   Not with-- not magically.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.000]   Now that they're invested in that, that's so intriguing.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.560]   You don't want to bet against Microsoft.
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.720]   I think HoloLens is very interesting.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:24.040]   You really wonder, though, where is Apple in all of this?
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.600]   Why hasn't Apple made any announcements?
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.400]   Maybe they don't test stuff for a while.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:27.800]   Oh, look, that works.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:28.400]   That works great.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.400]   John Muir.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.440]   It's like John Muir's really there.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.240]   That's neat.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:35.640]   That was fun.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.520]   Don't smoke, he's saying.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.360]   Right.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:40.840]   Let's see.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.520]   Other quickies-- Nikon apparently has a secret project
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.480]   with iOS.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:56.000]   This story from Nikon rumors where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.680]   iOS engineers working on a new secret project with Nikon
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:01.800]   at the main Apple campus that would apparently
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:09.360]   be a new iOS app from Nikon that would add a special new camera
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.000]   features through Wi-Fi.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.560]   We've talked a long time about computational photography.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.120]   We have the lens.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.800]   And even the sensor isn't what's so important.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.680]   It's the smarts.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.240]   And a tying a very powerful computer, like a smartphone,
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.560]   to a camera really can give you some amazing results.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:30.200]   The combination of the camera and the IMU
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:32.520]   were the inertial measurement unit.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.080]   That's also-- that's what you see in there.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.760]   That's the sensor that knows where the camera is angled
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:39.800]   or pointing or tilting or rotating.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.320]   The positional information, in addition
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:46.320]   to the video that can come into the camera,
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:54.040]   gives a whole order of magnitude of additional material
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.760]   to be computed that can turn into a 3D database
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.760]   to build a rough model and remap the video or the photo
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.320]   onto the model.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.760]   So when you're talking about VR in the future,
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.240]   someone will be able to take their phone
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.680]   and walk around you with it.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.000]   And they'll put you right in VR.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.960]   Create a model that will go right into VR.
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.360]   And there you'll be able to walk around you in VR.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.480]   But have to be an other artificial intelligence
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:25.920]   app that would say, OK, where are the bones in his face?
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.440]   How am I going to organize the animation of the face
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:32.880]   to work with the bone so he can start talking
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.400]   and then infer the knowledge of how the mouth is going
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:40.600]   to be moving and map that real time into your persona form
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:42.440]   or your avatar?
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.120]   This has been fun.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:43.960]   We've really learned--
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:46.760]   I'm really excited about the future.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:48.360]   Hey, we talk a lot.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.360]   We'll wrap this up with a kind of a fun little promo.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.280]   We talked a lot about the great book, The Martian.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:58.520]   I don't know if you read that amazing science fiction story.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.000]   We actually interviewed the author on triangulation.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.360]   And right about when we interviewed him,
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.560]   they announced that The Martian had
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:11.520]   been optioned for a movie to be directed by Ridley Scott
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:14.400]   of all people, which is very exciting, starring Matt Damon.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:18.800]   And in the first viral video promoting the film is out.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:20.880]   I think The Martian will be out at Christmas.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.440]   Let's take a look.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.400]   And made her is it.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.240]   The Martian is a story of an astronaut
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.480]   that gets stranded on Mars.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:30.960]   Here's--
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.720]   Oh, look, it's Matt Damon.
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:33.600]   Matt Damon has a astronaut.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.760]   I don't know what language that is.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.440]   Mark Watney.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.160]   Problem is, he's stranded all alone.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.960]   Armenian?
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:43.720]   With a bunch of stuff, he has to figure out
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:49.240]   how to save his life, get off Mars, with the stuff he's got.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:52.120]   And this absolutely looks like--
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.120]   Hi, kids.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.920]   This is Mark Watney, astronaut.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.880]   We're about six hours before our launch here on The Hermes.
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.960]   And I've been asked by the good folks at NASA
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:05.480]   to introduce you to some of our crewmates here, which I'm
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.160]   happy to do.
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:06.880]   So hello, Earthlings.
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.240]   It looks like a periscope on our--
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.240]   Yeah, chat going on.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:12.120]   I'm your personal guide on this tour of The Hermes.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.440]   Mark Watney's probably the hottest spot in his ever.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:14.920]   [BLEEP]
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.680]   Astronaut, I can find it.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:18.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:22.480]   This is pilot Rick Martinez doing the pre-flight checks.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.120]   As you can see, he's using some pretty sophisticated--
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.080]   I'm looking forward to this.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:27.440]   --to get us to Mars.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:29.160]   You got enough fingers there, Rick?
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.360]   Just well doing my checkbook.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:31.800]   Hi there.
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.960]   I am Commander Melissa Lewis.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:36.840]   Dr. Chris Beck, applied surgeon.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:38.640]   My name is Alex Foulgan.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.440]   I am Majora Monastranon.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:42.000]   I'm Beth Johansson.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.880]   I don't think it spoils the book to say--
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:45.040]   Computer Expert.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.440]   --that they do land on Mars.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:49.600]   They start to set up their habitat,
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.520]   and then a giant Martian dust storm happens.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.200]   They think Watney's been killed and paled in an antenna,
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.720]   and they leave.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.080]   Turns out Watney's alive.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:00.960]   They're stuck there.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:01.880]   Stuck there.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.880]   They can't get back, because it's not
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:06.240]   easy to turn around.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.920]   And he's got to figure out how to survive several years
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:12.400]   till a rescue flight, a rescue mission could be sent.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.640]   It was a really good book.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.960]   If you haven't read the book, read the book first.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.840]   And I'm excited about the movie The Martian.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.160]   It's on its way.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.560]   Hey, thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.440]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.200]   Greg Patterson, I've got to thank you.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.560]   PersonaFoundation.org, you want to promote that?
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.560]   What do you want to promote?
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:26.960]   Not really.
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:27.560]   Yeah, it's--
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.320]   Come back and make a 3D character out of me, will you?
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:33.000]   Yeah, well, I would like to do that.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.320]   Let's bring Beth Noll back.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.560]   Yeah, we could do a lot of fun stuff.
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.200]   I think that would be awesome.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:41.480]   So to turn a new leaf in live radio,
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.240]   it's become radio, but with characters.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.360]   Radio with a virtue.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.240]   I think, in fact, if we could work it out,
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.640]   then you wouldn't have to leave your home in LA.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.400]   You'd just do the show anytime.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.520]   Yeah, right.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:51.520]   By Avatar.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.360]   Skyped in my underwear.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.120]   Wouldn't be the first time.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.280]   Also.
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.280]   That's a shoot me for--
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:58.800]   Not for you.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:01:59.800]   I'm talking about others.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:00.480]   The top four.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:00.880]   That's right.
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:01.680]   Just neck up.
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:02.560]   That's all.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:03.840]   I also want to thank Steve Kovac.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.280]   It's great to see you.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.120]   We were so sad because I discovered you
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.280]   after on your last day, practically.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.720]   Last week, yeah.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.560]   You moved to New York, but I'm glad to see you again.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.360]   And anytime you want to--
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.200]   Yeah, I want to make it.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:14.800]   Let us know.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.640]   And of course, we'll--
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:17.160]   did you have you on via Skype?
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:17.660]   Of course.
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:18.600]   It's just nice to have you in the studio.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.720]   Thanks to everybody who came to a great live audience.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.880]   How many of you are here for WWDC?
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.040]   One person.
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:25.520]   One person.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.760]   With an Apple Watch on, I think.
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:27.280]   Ah.
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.480]   How many of you are wearing Apple watches?
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.040]   There are three guys on my flight.
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:31.540]   Wow.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.280]   Four people of Apple watches.
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:37.000]   How many of you are here for Augmented World Expo?
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:37.880]   Raise your hand, Richard.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:38.960]   Where's the crickets sound?
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:41.240]   Oh, Richard's here for that.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.520]   Anyway, it's great to have you.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.560]   If you'd like to be in our live studio audience,
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:45.080]   we love it.
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:47.120]   All you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:50.040]   We'll be glad to put a chair out for you.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:52.640]   We do the show live, still doing it live.
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:58.600]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2,200 UTC on Twitch.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.960]   The new website will be up before we get back together again.
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:03.200]   But there is still-- there's-- it's very simple.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.120]   Twit.tv when the news site goes up on Thursday.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.440]   God willing.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.040]   And I think it will.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.680]   You'll see a button right on the front page.
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:12.240]   It says live.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.160]   You click that.
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:13.960]   You can pop it out.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.680]   You can still do all the stuff you do right now
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.560]   on the existing website.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.600]   It's just simpler, nicer, cleaner, and mobile responsive.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:20.520]   It looks great.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.760]   I think it arguably looks better on mobile than it does
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.160]   on a desktop.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.080]   But that will all happen before we're back again.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.080]   But you'll be able to go to twit.tv,
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.040]   click the live button and watch this live.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:32.440]   At that time, if you can't on demand versions of the show
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:35.920]   are available, also at twit.tv.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:38.960]   I'm hoping easy to find on the new site.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.680]   But if you can't find it there, you
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.000]   will find it in iTunes or Xbox Music or the podcast app
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.640]   on your favorite mobile platform.
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:48.360]   And I know a lot of you listen that way.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.480]   We also have some great twit apps.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:53.120]   And you'll find those on our website as well.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.000]   If you look at twit.tv/apps, pick the app that you like.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.480]   Install it on your device, including Roku, iPhone, Android,
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:02.600]   and Windows Phone.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.760]   We've got a great Windows Phone app.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:05.280]   Thanks to Dimitri Bialen.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.360]   Thanks to you for being here.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.240]   We'll see you next time.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.960]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:09.840]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:12.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.640]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.600]   Do on the twit.
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:15.100]   Nice.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.240]   Do on the twit, baby.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.040]   Do on the twit.
