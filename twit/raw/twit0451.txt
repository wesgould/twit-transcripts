[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.880]   Really?

[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.240]   It's time for Twit this weekend.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.080]   The show where we talk about the week's tech news and we, you know, every week I love the
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.240]   chance to get together with the smartest, best journalists in the business.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.720]   But this is an unusually good panel today.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.320]   I'm really glad you tuned in for it.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   We're going to start all the way to my right.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.000]   John C. Devorak is here wearing his division two national football thing.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.260]   And I want to remind people that it was central Missouri won the division two basketball
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.260]   championship.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.260]   This is real basketball.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.320]   It's not corrupted by the big universities.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   It's not correct.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.120]   Central Missouri's mules and I invite anyone who happens to be from that school to send
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   me a sweatshirt.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   Okay, there you go.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.840]   Do you have a bracket?
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.080]   Do you follow March Managers?
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   This was a division.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080]   Is that the corrupt stuff?
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.400]   Oh, the corrupt stuff is just there was a thing on real sports.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.240]   Watch this with the Brian Gumbel.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.040]   And they just went right after North Carolina and everybody else.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   Total corruption and it should be professional sports.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.720]   Because they're not at.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.920]   They're not student athletes.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.880]   They're giving them degrees in general studies.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   They're ripping off these kids.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   That's sad.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   That's what I feel bad about.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.200]   Yeah, the kids think they're going to go to a school.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   They get a degree.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.080]   They end up getting me while you go to get a NBA contract making $50 million dollars a
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.240]   year making nothing.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.400]   And you should go watch the vision to stuff.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   It's got no corruption.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   It's a war.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   That org slash blog.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.120]   John has now used his entire quota for the show.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   No agenda show.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.840]   We forgot about playing that.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.600]   Sitting to his left, Mr. Tim Stevens.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.920]   So good to have you former editor and chief at Engagedies.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.560]   Now at CNET and you're here for the build conference.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.360]   We got you out and your lovely wife.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   Yes.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.000]   From the bitterly cold northern upstate New York.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   Yeah, I was saying it was 15 degrees when I flew out on Thursday.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.600]   So it's a little bit nicer now.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Wow.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   I mean, it was raining yesterday and everyone was complaining.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   I was like, this isn't so bad.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   It was freezing yesterday.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   It was freezing yesterday.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.360]   I'm surprised that you could stand it.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   Freezing here.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.760]   No, all over it was cold.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   Oh.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   Chillie.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.160]   And look who's here.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.680]   I thought she gave up the internet.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.320]   That's why we hadn't invited Jolie Odell to be on the show.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.200]   Then there was a Twitter stream going back and forth.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.120]   And you even said, yeah, I'll be on the show.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.680]   So we immediately called you.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   You did.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.480]   Welcome back from Venture Beat, Jolie Odell.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   Yes.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.880]   You said you're in management now?
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   I am managing editor.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   Wow.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   That's congratulations.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   That's wonderful.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   It's wonderful.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.160]   We have such a talented group of writers and I'm honored to support them.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.600]   I went to your website a few months ago and it says I've given up the internet.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   And I thought, well, I guess we can't.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   Because, by the way, I hope I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   But this is on the internet.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   The show.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   The show.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   The show here.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yes, I do.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.680]   Would you have done the show when you had given up the EI?
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   Absolutely.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   Anything for you.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Okay.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.720]   If I have the opportunity to run my mouth, I'm going to take it.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.000]   Is this on every week of the show?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Twice weekly now.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Huh.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   They'll invite me to the other one.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.720]   Never.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.840]   I do that one in my jammies at home.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   Chads, like, wait a minute.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   We don't put that one on the internet.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Okay.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.640]   And just me, I, in my e-vape cigarette.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   Quantification.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.240]   So, did you give up the internet?
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.240]   This is what I say.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.040]   But see, I have this paranoid imagination.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.120]   And it just runs wild.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.920]   I don't know if other people do this.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.880]   But you know, given a little bit of information.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.280]   Oh, I know they do that because I've been watching CNN all week.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.400]   Given just a little information, I will build, I will conflate a giant story around it.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.920]   The giant story I told myself was, poor Jolie, she was probably harassed off the internet.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   Oh, no.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   Is that not true?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.960]   The trolls couldn't keep me off the internet.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   You don't care about that.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   They don't care about them.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.680]   Because they don't pay me.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.760]   If you're a young, attractive woman on the internet, it's got, I mean, it's bad enough
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   for me as an old fat girl.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   If you're a young, attractive woman in the world, you get bothered and you can choose
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.360]   to retaliate, ignore, or laugh it off, or get hurt.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   What do you do?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.240]   Well, I used to get hurt and now I just, I can't care.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   You just let it, what do you do?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   I don't see it anymore.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.040]   So, no, the reason I got off the internet was because of legitimate privacy and security
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   concerns.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   Very important.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.520]   I think of certain Snowden related things.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.080]   Everybody's been a little bit antsy about it and I just got a little, I'm like, well,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.640]   I have to put my money where my mouth is.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   If I say I'm concerned, I could.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.880]   Was it Snowden revelations last June that prompted this?
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   Oh, interesting.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   Well, yes.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.920]   And also talking to the companies that were implicated in those kinds of things a lot.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   Oh, goodness.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.040]   Well, you probably know what I'm talking about too.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.200]   Because John is constantly harassed.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   Absolutely.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   I am as well.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Where are you looking at?
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   Everybody on that side of the table.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   I give up.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   What?
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   No, you're an internet happy little kid.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   I get harassed all the time.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.160]   No, it's more harassed than I do.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160]   I do, and it's horrible and it's because I'm so good looking and I understand that.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   And so I just embrace it.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.120]   I say, they hate me because they love me.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   Like Rihanna.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   You're like Rihanna.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120]   Very much like Rihanna.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120]   Okay.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.880]   In fact, I think Chris Brown beat me up.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   I could be wrong.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   I got a text from my son this morning.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.440]   He's flying back to college.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.280]   He says, I can't go back.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.720]   I broke my collarbone.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   He did?
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   I said, what?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   How do you get that?
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.880]   I see to a hospital get an x-ray.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   And he did.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   He said, oh, good news.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   It's just highly, you know, bad sprain.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.720]   But I thought, how do you sprain your collarbone?
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.640]   So that's what I asked him, especially at eight in the morning.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.000]   He said, I was, I was throwing.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Oops.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Oops.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Sorry.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   What did you do?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I just made a mistake.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.800]   Did you change this to, oh gosh, it's Korean.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   You changed it to Korean.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   Anybody in the room speak Korean.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.120]   You know, you can figure it out.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.760]   I don't even know what it's doing, but it's doing it in Korean.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.280]   Everything's Q2 looking.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.120]   I know now, I now know how to say Twitter.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   Is that Korean?
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   What is it?
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   It looks like Angol.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   What is that?
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.400]   Oh, man, John, I can't believe you did that.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   I think that's Japanese.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   It was an accident.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.480]   That's not definitely not Japanese.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.680]   I think it's, you know, it's got a lot of, oh, it's Korean.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.320]   Is that, you know, Korean, the Korean language that the symbols on there are, how are you
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.480]   supposed to form your mouth to say the word?
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   What?
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   Is that true?
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.600]   Because the Japanese destroyed their language and the Koreans had to reinvent the language
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.080]   based on their, they already could talk it, but the written language was gone.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   So they wrote this crazy language that actually defines the way you move your mouth to say
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   the word.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   That's fascinating.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   Yeah, it is.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   The Koreans, not an Asian language.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   That's why there's a round one is what you...
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   That's so interesting.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   You'll open your mouth.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.640]   You must be much easier to learn how to read as a Korean child.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   I'll tell you.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   Maybe.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   Korean, much more compelling.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   God, I can't read that at all.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.720]   You know, it's just really weird to me that you can't lock that some idiot from doing
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   that.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   Some of these...
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   Idiot surprises me.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   Steve Liu can adjust the brightness in Korean.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   There you go.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.040]   Oh, they've been that easy.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.680]   It goes west to east.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680]   It goes west to east.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   Wow.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   Okay.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   Back to the show.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.920]   Anyway, so I said, "Henry, how did you bust your collarbone?"
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   He said.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.000]   I was throwing somebody out of the house and then he tackled me.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.200]   So I don't know what's been going on at the house while I've been gone.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Anyway, I'm here now.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   I don't know.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   I don't ask him.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   He's 18.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   He's from the hot size.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   Oh, he can leave.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.320]   Did you have this kind of problem with your kids?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.280]   No, my kids are just fantastic.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.640]   I told him not to tell his mother.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.880]   Our show today, let's talk about tech news.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.680]   What do you say?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   Is there any tech news this week?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.400]   It seems to me there is.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   I could be wrong.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Didn't Edward Snowden reveal that the NSA has been spying on 22 world leaders?
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   Even as we speak?
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.000]   Yeah, was that tech news?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   That's just politics.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.960]   Do you think Edward Snowden should reveal that stuff?
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.880]   Shouldn't he be revealing the stuff that affects us in violation of the Fourth Amendment
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.480]   rather than just the spy activities?
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.800]   He gave all the information over to the Guardian and to greenwell and some other people.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.600]   And they're picking and choosing what to write about it.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Snowden's not doing anything to him.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.240]   He's sitting around hanging out with Russian hookers.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.160]   That's what I do.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.840]   I was stuck in Russia.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.160]   I know what the big story was this week.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.440]   Facebook bought Oculus VR.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   Yeah, I know everybody.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   Two billion dollars.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   Yeah, wasn't that a publicly financed company one of those?
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Kickstarter.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   Kickstarter.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.440]   Now everybody, these guys get billions of the Kickstarter people get nothing.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.760]   Notch, the guy who created Minecraft, had put down $10,000 as part of the book.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   They're the Kickstarter.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.600]   But that wasn't an equity investment.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   Well, that's...
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   So he gets bup-kissed.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.120]   He gets bup-kissed.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.560]   And he went down and visited the Oculus folks.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   Got very excited.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.600]   And then only last week decided to do a Minecraft virtual reality version.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.000]   As soon as the acquisition happened, he said, "You know, I love these guys.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.800]   I think that it's a great product, but I don't want to do this for Facebook, so that's it.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   We're killing the project."
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   Yeah, he said Facebook for him.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   Good for him.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.120]   So therefore, I don't want anything to do with that.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.480]   And he was only the first, or quite a few other smaller indie developers who kind of
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.960]   followed suit and said the same sort of thing.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.200]   Well, all you have to do is go to the Kickstarter project page and see all the comments.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.120]   Yeah, I think that's a little bit premature to be really pulling the trigger and that
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   kind of thing.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.480]   I mean, nobody knows exactly what Facebook's going to do with Oculus.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.040]   Certainly it changes the tone of the conversation about Oculus being this really interesting
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   product.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   Not gaming anymore.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.840]   I mean, it could be gaming, but it could be a very different sort of gaming.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.760]   I mean, gaming is one of those popular things to do on Facebook, you know, Farmville and
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.640]   all those other great high quality titles.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.240]   And people didn't really want that sort of experience on Oculus.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.280]   They wanted more of like a hardcore gaming experience.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.680]   Now the thought is upset.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.560]   Yeah, it's primarily the hardcore gamers and those who are invested in this product.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.880]   It finally would bring great VR to home.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.760]   And now the question is, is it going to be as good as it was?
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.720]   I kicked in 300 bucks and I got my developer kit and it's still under my desk and never
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   used.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   But I feel like that's what I paid for it.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.040]   That's what I got.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   And you're right.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.960]   We weren't at Kickstarter's at great pains to tell everybody again and again, you're not
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.360]   an equity investor.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.000]   I just, I'm baffled by everybody thinking that this has anything to do with gaming whatsoever.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The rift.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.880]   I mean, the acquisition, the deal.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.720]   Well, I don't know what it has to do with Mark Zuckerberg said.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   Oh, good.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.000]   Let me tell you what was a set and you said if he's lying.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   What Zuckerberg said is that a, well, okay, I'm going to project on to it.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.800]   You know, the current big thing is mobile.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.160]   Then here comes wearables.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   He said, and I think they almost missed mobile.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.480]   I mean, they were late to the table.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.640]   They fortunately were able to save the, save it and came back strong and mobile.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.720]   He said that he believes virtual reality is the next big platform.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.800]   And when you say that big, that's a big word in the,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.240]   Yeah, I haven't heard that before.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.520]   But he doesn't, he's being paranoid.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.440]   He doesn't want to miss out.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   He's at the point where he's getting paranoid.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   He's got the cash.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   They're buying best of class companies, Instagram, WhatsApp and now Oculus.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   It's funny.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.160]   They're making, they're making two big bets on opposite ends of the day.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.880]   One is very, very low end where it's just messaging and it has a global focus that anybody can
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   use.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   And then they have, when you're looking very far forward in places where quality of life
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   is already really, really high, it's not about wearing some bizarre scuba mask looking
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.000]   thing on your face.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.920]   It's about overlaying Facebook on everything.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.640]   And I think that won't have anything to do with hardware and it won't have anything to
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   do with gaming.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.720]   But why would they want Oculus VR then?
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   I mean, isn't that, why do you want Facebook and 3D?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.160]   Google Glass is one way of projecting.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.200]   Yeah, I think Mark's worried about glass.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   I don't think so at all.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   I don't think so at all.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   Horrible experience.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   I think he wants to get to the next level of experience and it comes without a face mask.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.720]   He just has to figure out how to get there and why people are so intrigued by the experience
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.120]   of Oculus VR.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.120]   Are they really intrigued?
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   First of all, two billion.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   Two huge, horrible looking advice.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   I think, I think, totally, right, we're not talking about that thing.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.560]   That's just a very early prototype.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.040]   My generation, and I think a lot of people in technology grew up with two books, NeuroMancer
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   by Gibson and Steve Gibson, William Gibson's NeuroMancer, where the protagonist jacked
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.880]   in to a virtual reality world.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   And of course, Neil Stevenson's "Snowcrash" and the metaverse, where they, and I think
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.440]   Zuckerberg probably was a "Snowcrash" fanatic, read the book in '92 when it came out.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.640]   And I think that that has driven a lot of this VR research.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.960]   We want, do we not a world that we can interact?
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Not just gaming.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   Right.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.920]   But, and wouldn't this be great for Facebook if instead of going to look at it on a screen,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   I'm in this.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   No.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   God.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   Tim and I are going.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   You can stay behind.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   No.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   I'm ready to go too.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.320]   John and I will move to our cabin in the woods in where Tin foil hats.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.720]   I would be happy to do the woods and I would still love to do this.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   So, I think...
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   He already has a Tin foil hat.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Tin foil hat too.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.520]   It is a curious acquisition though because when they bought WhatsApp, when they bought
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.480]   Instagram, they bought a lot of users.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.080]   I mean, a lot of users.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.680]   Here they bought no users.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   No two users.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   No users really at all.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   And a very simple technology.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   I mean, Palmer Luck has done amazing stuff to make this hardware as simple as it is.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.720]   And we've seen PlayStation come out of the gate very quickly with something that's not
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   exactly handicapped.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Mike and Microsoft.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   Microsoft won't be too far behind.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.560]   I do think they've got to put the phone in the future.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.080]   What you're saying is they both bought red and black for an analogy John will understand.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.880]   Yeah, be devil zero, believe me.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.280]   By buying WhatsApp, they bought the low end.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.520]   Now, once an investment in the present, there are next billion users and the others in investment
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   in the future.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.520]   Hey, you got the money for bid.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   It's not cash.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520]   It's stock.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.320]   Yeah, there's just a third of it was cash.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.520]   I mean, I don't see how Oculus is really that far.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   It wasn't a third.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   It's a third to the other technologies around it.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520]   Well, because it's so...
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   They don't have a great user base.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   They don't have a lot of developers.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   The idea of Facebook being overly on everything you do is the futures developers.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   And that's the thing.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.680]   If they turned off those developers and they've lost half of half the reason for making the
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   acquisition of the first.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   Well, F8's coming up awfully soon.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   I guess we'll find out.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   Yeah, I can't wait.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   They always have goodies to keep developers from.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   That's Facebook's development.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Here's my prediction.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   And that I will be going to...
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   What's coming up?
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   F8.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   Your fate.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   Bump, bump, bump.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Here's my prediction.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   Yes.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   Poor acquisition fail.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   The thing...
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.260]   Two years from now, it'll be given up on the way Microsoft does with every other thing it
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260]   tries to do.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.720]   Yeah, it won't be around in two years.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   I think Oculus...
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   It won't be the form factor we know.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   No, no, no.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   The whole thing.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   The whole thing.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.840]   I think VR is going to happen.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.840]   I think it's very early days, just as it is with Google Glass.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.240]   Neither is completely satisfactory.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.560]   I threw up almost immediately an Oculus VR.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.040]   Bless your heart.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.480]   It turns out, according to Dana Boyd, that means I'm a girl.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.840]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   Oh, I love Dana.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   That's bull crap.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.720]   No, she's got biological proof.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.080]   But I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.620]   I think that... Did she take into account your vision issues?
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.860]   No, she doesn't know me.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.460]   I think that the really smart thing and that Oculus could do at this point is say to developers,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.620]   "Look, we were only going to go so far with the money we got, a couple of million we got
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.780]   on Kickstarter, the 75 million we got from Virtual Adventure Capital.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:40.580]   With Facebook, we have long runway to give away VR gear to...
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.620]   This is Mark Zuckerberg saying, "I want to see this because I believe VR is going to
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.620]   be a platform."
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.720]   And I'm hoping that's true because it's going to take that kind of money over a long time,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.620]   maybe 10, 20 years to this to become a reality.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.380]   Who are you going to push it out that far?
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.380]   Well, I'm waiting.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.500]   I want this to the nursing home.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.300]   I want to be lying in the bed with the thing plugged in.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   I'll be in Paris.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.300]   I won't know.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   I'll be happy.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.300]   That's what I want.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   That's sick.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   No, it's not sick.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   Oh my God.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   That's good.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.780]   I will come pull your plug, sir.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.540]   And I won't be able to do anything because I'll just be lying.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   Compared to the reality of the situation.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540]   I'll be in Paris.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.700]   Some girl will sneak up and pull my plug.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.340]   So Dana Boyd wrote a twist.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.500]   Plug pulled in Paris.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.100]   An interesting article on Quartz saying that the Oculus Rift is sexist.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.620]   Now, I have to say...
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.780]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.780]   It made me nauseous.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.780]   Poor choice of terminology.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.780]   I don't think it's sexist.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.180]   No, no.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.180]   That's some stupid headline writer.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.780]   But what she did point out is there is a gender difference in how people have perceived
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.140]   simulated 3D environments.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.580]   She talks about there's two different ways all of us work.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.700]   There's one that we can perceive 3D by shading.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.900]   And that's because we do micro adjustments of our eyes at all times.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.340]   We're going back and forth.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.620]   And we can perceive the three dimensions by the kind of parallax.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.780]   And the other kind of depth, perception is motion parallax.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.900]   So that if I have this coffee mug and it comes towards me, it's getting bigger, my brain
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.980]   realizes it's unlikely the coffee mug is actually swelling.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.460]   So it says, "Oh, it's getting closer."
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.140]   That's one way of depth perception, the other is with shading.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.740]   It turns out that VR, as we've seen it so far, works very well with this kind of motion
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.980]   parallax depth perception.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.060]   It doesn't do the shading very well.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.220]   It turns out that women...
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.620]   Or how do I say this in a non-sexist way?
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.620]   Females.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.420]   Oh, that's even worse.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.420]   Females.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.900]   Tanned, not because I got sick, but tanned to use the shading...
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   No, wait, wait.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.700]   The way you've set the structure of that sentence is females because I got...
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.060]   I'm not saying it's not all you...
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060]   It's like there are...
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.060]   I'm a man.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.700]   Well, I don't know.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.900]   I don't want to have to show you, but I'm a man.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.900]   We don't want to see.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900]   Man.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.900]   Look at that.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   Man.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900]   Anyway.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   I still got sick, but what they're saying is...
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.380]   What she's saying is she has observed and has been observed before that women tend to get
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.940]   more nauseated by these virtual reality things.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.060]   And she thinks it has to do with...
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   She has observed.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.060]   Does she present with others?
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   She says we need more research.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.060]   This is silly.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.060]   Okay.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   You know what she did?
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.060]   It was interesting.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.780]   Is she talking to male gamers who are used to doing all kinds of first person shooter crazy?
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.820]   Because like, that makes me nauseous.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.300]   Not because it's violent, but because you're just...
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   You're moving too much.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   There's too much.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.180]   And I think if she was talking to groups of men who play first person shooters and women...
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.180]   She went to get this.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:41.140]   It was a gender clinic in Utrecht in the Netherlands where people were having transgender surgery
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.500]   and they were getting the initial hormones and they noted a change in how depth perception
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.420]   worked as the hormones started to kick you.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.420]   That's pretty weird.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.860]   That's a much more interesting than she observed.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.340]   That's where the evidence comes from.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.340]   Okay.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.340]   That's where the evidence comes from.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.340]   I can stop pooping it then I'm very happy.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:03.020]   It turns out that there besides the genitalia, the number two site for sex hormones is the
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   retinas.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.020]   The retinas.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   The retinas.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   That's your...
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   That's your eyes, Jonathan.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   Oh, the ret...
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.260]   Oh, I thought you were referring to a band.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.260]   I know what you thought.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.260]   That's Switzerland.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.180]   So anyway, it's...
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.220]   I admit it's not scientific proof, but I think it's an interesting point.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.460]   Anyway, I did get sick.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.500]   And you know, car sickness, motion sickness comes from a disconnect between what you're
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.100]   receiving and what your inner ear is perceived.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.740]   Yeah, you get seasick that way.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.300]   Yeah, you bounce around and extend.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.060]   I had somebody call me who's a pilot or works in Air Force simulation.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.420]   He says, "Oh, cold, wet cloth in the back of the neck fixes it every time."
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.420]   That's interesting.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.420]   It's possible.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.100]   Well, here's the way I'm seeing this thing.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.860]   This is neither going to fly.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.700]   It's a bad investment.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.780]   The only real long term use for this sort of thing is going to be for engineering.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.700]   People, they've got to, you know, formulaize a car.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.900]   They've got to see the model in 3D and they've got to be able to walk around it and all
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.900]   the rest of it.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.620]   What's going to take over the gaming and the rest of it is going to be freestanding display
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.820]   technology that projects 3D without glasses or any aid.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.180]   We're a long way from that being cheap and being good.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.020]   Well, where as Oculus is now, it's cheap and good.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.020]   No, but he's right.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.020]   It's not good.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   It's not good.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.020]   It's a lot better than any sort of projection.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.740]   No, there's no way to, but I'm told the second generation was very good.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:27.340]   Not of them are good, but they'd work and they're working on this.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.060]   It would be so much easier if we all just had constantly running smoke machines in our
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   houses.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   How about that for an idea?
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.100]   Why don't we just live in the real 3D world and we don't have to worry about.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.340]   Look at the face sponsorship and it'd be fine.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.900]   The shading is perfect.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.020]   You know, in the long run, in the long run, it's not going to be a helmet.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.860]   It's got to be a way to plug into your sensorium directly.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.260]   So it all five senses.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.260]   Oh, God.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.260]   No.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.260]   It's got to be tased.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.260]   It's got to be smelled.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.260]   It's got to be touch.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.460]   It's got to be hearing and it's got to be eyes.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.460]   It's got to be a little bit off the spectrum.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.700]   When you get all of that, it will be realistic and I predict it will be not me in my lifetime
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.300]   or yours, John.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   Might be in Tim's and it'll definitely be in Jolie's.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.300]   Oh, God.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   Now Jolie is against it.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   I am.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.580]   Well, okay, when you look at, let's talk about science fiction.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.580]   Okay.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.820]   In all the dystopian versions of the future, you're too plugged in.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.580]   You're too connected.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.340]   Everything computing related is like right in front of you, touchable.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.260]   And in the less dystopian versions of it, you have access to computing when you want
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.340]   it, but it doesn't take over your life.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.740]   You're still essentially human.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   People do want to disconnect.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.380]   Although I got to tell you, do you not notice that everybody, everybody is constantly looking
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.780]   at their smartphone all the time?
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.700]   Yeah, not you, Jolie.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   You're just a weirdo.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.860]   I know.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.700]   You know that's why you have me on.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.700]   You are an outlet.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.700]   You know that.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   Yes.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.260]   But I have to say you walk down the street and everybody is living in this.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   I have to yell at people.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.260]   I have to say, heads up sweetheart.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.260]   You've got to hang me.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.380]   I go to the cell phone to get cues because I have a number of people that are queuing
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.580]   me what to talk about, including.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.580]   His name is Leo Laport.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.140]   He used to work with him in the early 90s.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.780]   And as somebody mentioned in my stream here to still haven't got speech recognition to
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.780]   work on such a thing.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620]   I acknowledge this or handwriting.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.660]   There's a lot of things a human brain can do that computers are terrible at.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.580]   And I'm sure this is one of them.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.420]   But that doesn't mean we shouldn't work on it.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   Don't you think?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.740]   Well, I don't know if we should.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.740]   I don't know this.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.780]   Somebody with the money has got some evil behind it.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.220]   I'm not convinced of any of this.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.300]   Well, this is why people, people don't trust Facebook, right?
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.300]   They don't trust Mark.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.580]   But if somebody with the money of Mark Zuckerberg is willing to plunge money into it, some real
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.060]   money, not two billion, tens of billions.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.060]   All right.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.140]   I would be interested to see what comes out the end.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.140]   Wouldn't you?
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.140]   It's not all.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.140]   So I can condemn it later.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.140]   Later.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.820]   You know, it's just a thing all that way.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.820]   Fuel for columns.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.820]   Just think of it that way.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.980]   Lots of fuel.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.940]   It wouldn't be so disturbing if Facebook's business model wasn't advertising and selling
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.940]   people.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.860]   What's wrong with that?
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.740]   And you're talking to Leo, who is a advertising selling people guy.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   You know what?
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.140]   I think capitalism is beautiful.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.660]   And I think ad supported media is here to stay.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.700]   And she's part of that too.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.180]   You know, I'm the only one here.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.060]   I will say right now that the kind of ads that we sell are not in fact.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.700]   Here we go again.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.940]   Coordinated to the audience.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.700]   We don't try to, you know, do research.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.220]   However, I have no problem with Google or Facebook trying to give me ads and stuff I'm
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.220]   interested in.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.220]   I would much rather see.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.140]   Unfortunately, on Microsoft, you have, wait a minute, let me ask you this question.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.540]   You have no problems going on to Amazon and buying the mug that you're holding and then
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.220]   getting relentless ads to buy the mug long after you already bought the mug.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.820]   That's because it's poorly done.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.820]   Very poorly done.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.820]   And these are the experts.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.820]   No, I think.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.140]   But the better it's done, it's just intended to part of full from his money.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.220]   No, you're not a fool, but there are a lot of more valuable people out there and it's
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.220]   evil.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.860]   It's because advertisers would prefer to spend money on people who are likely to buy their
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.300]   product as a.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.660]   You're thinking of a kind of advertising that I actually don't like.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.260]   It's advertising to trick people to separate a fool from their money.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.260]   That's all advertising money.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.020]   But it isn't all advertising because don't we do buy stuff.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.220]   And what I would like to see, and I think we do it here and I think that it's the coming
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.020]   trend, is advertising that says, here's what we do.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.020]   Here's the value.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.420]   If you would like it, this is where you get it.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.580]   I've worked at agencies and that's just, it's all trickery.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.100]   Oh, that's old.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   That's Edgar Benez.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.740]   That's the old way of PR.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.700]   And I do believe we're entering a new era because of the internet connected consumer.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   They're smart.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.660]   You're going crazy today.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   I have decided.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660]   He's all fired up.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   I've decided that I am going to.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:44.020]   I have been suppressed by people like you and people like you who've been putting a lid
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.020]   on me.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.740]   And I've decided I'm going to come out full force.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:53.920]   I ever said, you're trying right now, come out full force in favor of the notion that
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.380]   I use a free service like Google, Facebook, they're fantastically useful.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.340]   They need to make, they need to monetize that.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   They do with advertising.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.860]   I would prefer they do it with advertising that for something I'm interested in.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.700]   I would prefer they just take my money.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.140]   I totally agree with that.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.580]   However, what about Google and Facebook working together and sharing that information that
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.420]   they have about you with the government with each other, selling that information.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.220]   This is the only time when there's a third time that you.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   That's when I was with you.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.460]   It's one thing for them to create a profile and for an advertiser to be able to target ads
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.460]   against somebody like you.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.780]   But it's okay for Facebook to sell your information to another group and then build a bigger profile
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.260]   to what end to whatever end for better ads.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.460]   For example, if Facebook sold their facial recognition database to targets and when
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.580]   you walked into Target, they took a picture of you and knew who you were and were able
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.460]   to track you where you went in the store.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.460]   Is that okay?
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.900]   Yeah, as long as the purpose of it is, and I think it is for these companies, to target
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.820]   me with more appropriate ads.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.340]   Not show me diaper ads because I don't have infants.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.420]   I don't want to see diaper ads.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.740]   That's a waste of my time.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.420]   To show me ads for adult diapers because I'm in my 50s.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.980]   Hey, oh, but no, serious.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.620]   I'm actually being very serious here.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.620]   I don't think that is a detriment and I don't care if they do that.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.780]   Now John always brings up this, I think, red herring.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.940]   What about the insurance companies of the government?
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.940]   It's not a great thing.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.940]   I agree.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.940]   That's a problem.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.860]   Yeah, now the insurance companies get to date and say, Leo, you're not paying enough
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.780]   for your life insurance because you're drinking a lot of beer.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.380]   Now, look at these donuts.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.380]   You're buying a lot of donuts.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.940]   I agree with you and I will fight that and I think that's wrong.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.780]   Well, I don't think that those entities are the ones you have to worry about.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.940]   At this point, I think it's more likely that a hacker is going to expose that data.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.940]   There's that too.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.940]   Hacker.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.860]   It happens I'm going to tell people.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.460]   I would say they're going to say, well, Leo leaves his house every single day at three
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.820]   o'clock and be leaving in a very scared paranoid state to really see what we'll get
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.820]   robbed.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.180]   And fingerprint recognition for identification purposes if it's being used at your bank or
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.180]   with your online purchasing.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.180]   So, what with that?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.180]   Just take all your money, Leo.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.660]   But when someone hacks it, darling, then you lose all your money and your identity.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.580]   That will not happen because the commercial interests in this capitalist country want
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.500]   all of this stuff because it helps them make better money.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.340]   They're going to make sure just as they do right now with ATM, nobody lost any money
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   from Target.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   Nobody lost any money from Target.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.340]   You know it lost money?
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.780]   Target and the other credit card companies who had to re-issue.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.020]   Not one penny was lost by consumers.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.020]   You're stunned.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.060]   Ever because they will continue to indemnify you because they want to do business.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.860]   Somebody's losing money on this deal because all the credit card companies do the exact
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.860]   same thing.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.780]   They say screw it, let people steal the cars.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.780]   We don't care.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.340]   We're going to charge you 26% interest on your card and that will make up for all of our
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.340]   losses.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   You don't have to pay on them.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   I don't have a credit card.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   I have a credit card for that reason.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.660]   Well, I use American Express.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.660]   Nobody made you do it.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.660]   It's a credit card.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.660]   It's a really not a credit card.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   It's because of those damn cupcakes.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.660]   You have to pay.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.660]   I blame you.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.660]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.860]   I did use the brown acid this time.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.100]   I told you not to use the brown acid.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.700]   But you know I just decided that I've been letting this go for a long time, this kind
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.420]   of notion that, oh, they're collecting information.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.980]   I'm not sure that's the detriment.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.260]   So you ever change sides.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.500]   When it changes from advertising to something else, when they're turning into data brokers
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.540]   selling your information and when the government then starts to use that information.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.860]   It has to go that far before it's a problem.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.860]   But I totally agree.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.500]   We shouldn't be restricting that stuff because of the fear of hacking.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.700]   We should simply be building more secure systems.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.540]   And we get a lot of great stuff for free.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.780]   Now, I wish that Google, I guess they do with Google Apps, I wish that there were a
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.460]   paid Facebook so that you, Jolie, could use it.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.740]   But I don't think it would make any difference.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.220]   I think they'd still try to charge the time.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.420]   Let me tell you, this is why I quit the internet.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.740]   Because I believe in my personhood and my freedom so much that I don't want to be a commodity
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.900]   bought and traded based on the data that I generate.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.900]   And that's the way that's a emotional argument.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   That's a very emotional argument.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.780]   But you have a choice to do that, right?
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   Yes, I do.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   It's hard.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.780]   Oh, no.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.780]   It was wonderful.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.420]   I got to see people in person.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:55.580]   I personally really appreciate the benefits I get from the internet and I get a lot of
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.340]   great free stuff, including by the way, this programming.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.340]   Maybe that's it.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   I don't get free stuff.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.340]   I'm a journalist.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.340]   No, no, you get free stuff.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.340]   No, no, you get free stuff.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.340]   You get Google for free.
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.340]   Oh, I thought you meant free stuff.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.340]   Google is hellaciously useful.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.340]   I get a new phone.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.340]   I log into my Google account.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.220]   It's got all my contacts in my account.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.460]   That's hellaciously useful to me.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.540]   I did trade personal information for that.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.740]   But who can deny that that's really value?
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.740]   Wow.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.340]   All I ask is that they be upfront.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.820]   They say, we're going to give you this.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.660]   This is where Facebook's a little skeezy.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.580]   They don't really explain what you're giving up and what you're getting for it.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.140]   Google, I think, is very straightforward.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140]   We're going to take this information.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.780]   We're going to use it to target ads.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.260]   They're constantly telling you what they're doing.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.260]   And it's a little harder than Facebook to opt out of things.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.260]   Wow.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.060]   Like the facial recognition, if you want to opt out of that, it's a lot of clicks and
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.220]   they don't even say what it is exactly.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.700]   It's more about face tagging.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.260]   That's a little bit concerning.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.620]   They feel a little sleazy.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.460]   I want to remind the listeners and the chat room out there, can you imagine what this show
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.900]   would be like without Jolie and me on here to balance these two?
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.980]   Why do you think you're here?
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   You think I invite you?
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   It's like totally.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.980]   Because I like your looks.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   We'll be saluting pretty soon.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.620]   I do invite you for a minute.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.380]   Why, Leo, what's that?
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.820]   Why, it's something that came in the mail the other day.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.140]   And I think it's a new sponsor.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   Shall we open it, John?
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:12.380]   I believe it's probably just a bunch of peanuts in a styrofoam.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.460]   Oh, it's my Harry's.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.460]   My Harry's game.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   I'm very excited.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.460]   Harry's.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   David, you're going to get a piece.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.460]   No, no, no.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.500]   You know the guys who started Warby Parker, Jeff, he was, you know, I like Jeff because
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.660]   he's a rebel.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.700]   He started Warby because he was mad about the monopoly in eyewear that was causing
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.700]   costing people too much money.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.260]   I need a razor to open my razor.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.260]   Thank you.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.260]   He decided to start.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.260]   You have a razor?
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.460]   Is it a Motorola razor in there?
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.460]   Oh, no.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.260]   John, stop with the bad puns.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.260]   This is just a--
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.260]   It's not a pun.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.260]   You said a razor.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.260]   It's a razor.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.260]   It's an--
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.260]   A razor blade?
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.180]   Harry's was found a couple-- less than a year ago by a couple of guys, Andy and Jeff.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.780]   You know, you might want to use the blade to cut through the thing there too.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.780]   You know what?
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.340]   Don't you enjoy it when like the tape just gives--
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   Never does.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.780]   Like you struggle, you struggle, you struggle and then just goes, all right, you're master.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.780]   That's what I'm going for here.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   You've got deep issues.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.780]   I know, it's so true.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   Okay.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   Get horse by the gate.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.460]   All right, no peanuts, nice paper packing.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.460]   This is my Harry's.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.460]   Oh, what a beautiful box.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.460]   I'm so excited.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.460]   That's awesome.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.460]   Okay, we're not--
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   This is nice.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.460]   This is nice.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.460]   Nice.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.460]   It's a great shaving experience.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.260]   These are blades, but they're not giving up that quality feel.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   Look at this.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260]   It looks so looks.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.260]   Isn't that a little snappy thingy?
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   Yeah, go ahead and snap it.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   Look at that.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   Yeah, mirror-digid.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.260]   Look at that.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   It's so heavy.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   Well, it's because it's got--
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.260]   It's just thoughtfully packaged.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.260]   I think it's beautiful.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.260]   Man, it's cool.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.260]   First of all, she just thought--
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.060]   She's going to have to buy this for her husband after all this.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.660]   Oh, you know what Aaron would love this.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.660]   Aaron would love this.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.660]   You know, he would.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.340]   Anybody with a guy in their life would love this.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.740]   It's gorgeous, simple product design, high quality blades.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.020]   These are-- where's the best knives, John?
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.740]   Where do they come from?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.340]   The best knives they come from Japan?
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.340]   No.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.340]   Germany.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.340]   Everybody knows that.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.340]   Play along, John.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   Play along.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.340]   How many blades is that?
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.340]   This one's a-- a file looks like a five-blader.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.660]   It is-- they're made and engineered in their factory in Germany for sharpness and strength.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.660]   Five.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   She counted them.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   Five?
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.660]   You know what-- did you know this?
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.660]   There's a blade-- a single blade on the inside here?
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   You can just--
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   Oh, that's for your bikini, Mom.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.660]   That's dangerous.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   Actually, this one doesn't have it.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.660]   But--
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.300]   You know what that-- there it is.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.620]   It's very nice.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.220]   So it's really six.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.220]   Just if you're counting.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   Go ahead.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   Isn't that-- is that not beautiful?
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.220]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.220]   That is a work of art.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.900]   And then what you also get with that, the lovely Harry's shave cream.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   I'm a fan of this.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.380]   Instead of the shave gel or the--
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.380]   Yes.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.380]   Let me try some shave a little bit.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.940]   The shave cream.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   It's fragrant.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   It's delicious.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   Let me just un-lish it.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.940]   I feel like we should bring you a hot towel.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.940]   Oh, you're going to love that.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.940]   You're going to love that.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.940]   I'm not just giving a finger.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.940]   So this is the--
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.940]   Here, let me see.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   Go and you can order the engraved Winston set.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.940]   Would you pull that up for me?
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   It was that meant.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.940]   Chad, yeah.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   Do you smell that?
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   Isn't that smell good?
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   It was shipped to my door.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   I love that looks.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.580]   It gives me a great shave and it's a great price.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.180]   It's $15 a set.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.660]   That includes a handle, three blades and the shave cream.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.420]   And before you check out, make sure you add a four pack of razors to your order then.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.300]   You're going to do the promo code to it and you'll get the four pack free.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.580]   That's not my raise of you.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.580]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.580]   Isn't it incredible?
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.580]   It's pretty much of you.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.460]   Harry's H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.460]   There are people, engineers.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460]   John, are you shaving?
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   You're shaving right now.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   Well, you gave me this stuff up.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.460]   Mine's well used.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.460]   Okay.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.460]   Mine's well used.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.460]   Try it out.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460]   Can I get another box now?
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.460]   That's my blade.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.460]   Sorry.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.460]   No, no, please.
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.460]   You know what, John?
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   Maybe you have to give me this package now.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.860]   Or take it.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.860]   It does, isn't it nice?
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.860]   Well, let me see it.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.660]   I want to know what I'm saying.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.660]   H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.660]   I actually need a new model.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.660]   Promo code to it.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.700]   You'll get the four blades free and the $15 handled, three blades and shave cream.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   That is a great deal.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.220]   And of course, then you're going to get your Harry's monthly.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.380]   I didn't realize that if I'd actually shaved with this, I had contaminated such an extreme
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.700]   you'd have to give it to me.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.700]   Huh.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.700]   I would have shaved with it then if I'd known that.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.700]   Yeah, well.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   Missed opportunity.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.700]   You come back, missed you.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.700]   You'll get one too.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.700]   In fact, you know what?
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.700]   You're all going to get a Harry's shave.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   I'll make sure all three of you get one.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.700]   Harry's.com.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.700]   Look, there's a little guy if you don't have a shave.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.340]   I think that's Shakespeare.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   That was a...
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   I think you're right.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   It's a true Shakespeare.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340]   You don't need a Shaver?
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.820]   Did you know that you're Trimmer's?
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.260]   John, did you know your facial hair is as coarse as copper wire?
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   I guess yours is copper.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.260]   Yours is copper wire.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.220]   Non-conductive, thank you.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.820]   Anyway, thank you, Harry's.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.940]   We're really glad to have you on the group.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.940]   And everybody try it.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.940]   Harry's.com.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.180]   And don't forget to use Twitch so you get that extra four pack of blades.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.180]   Absolutely.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.180]   Free.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:48.500]   Is Mark Zuckerberg the Warren Buffett of technology?
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   That's what Felix Simmons.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   Warren Zuckerberg.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   I love Felix, but there's the correlation there.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.380]   I don't see it either.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.580]   Is he the Elon Musk?
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.060]   I bet he wants to be Elon Musk.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.580]   I think he's the Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.580]   Yeah, that's good enough.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.580]   He's the other guy.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   You know what?
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.580]   He's like that.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.580]   Not so bad.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.780]   I'm starting to get some respect for Mark, I have to say.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.420]   He's grown up so much since he took that job.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.420]   He doesn't wear the shower.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.420]   I do the shower sandals anymore right here.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.420]   Well, that's disappointing.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.420]   He's a grown man now.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.540]   He was a boy when he started that company.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.500]   And the first few times I saw him speak at press conferences, he was just like a nervous
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   little boy.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   I just didn't know.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   Remember, I don't know.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   And now he's a man.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   There's a lot of animals.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.940]   That's like $30 billion to give you confidence.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.260]   I respect the shooting animals.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.260]   I do too.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.260]   I think it's great.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   He's not going to like hunting.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   But if you're going to eat meat, then that's the way to do it.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.260]   Are you a vegetarian?
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.260]   I'm a vegetarian, yes.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   That's good.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.260]   He's got an ethical point of view.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.820]   Me, I don't want to see the pig.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.620]   I just want the bacon.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.620]   Personally.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   He's got a common thought.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.580]   There's a lot of people that don't want to see anything that reminds them, you know,
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.220]   they'll eat the meat, but they don't want anything that looks like it's...
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.220]   My husband's like that.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.620]   I love killing animals and eating them.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.340]   Like we did a crab boil one time.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.180]   I was naming them and trash talking them as I put them in the pot.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.500]   Now you're talking, that's a cook.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:08.340]   I like to butcher pig meat, you know, with the skin and the fat and everything.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.500]   Usually, have you had goat?
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   No, I'm not.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   You're probably not.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   Have you ever had goat?
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   No, seriously.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.340]   Well, they're relatively small animals.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.100]   You get to...
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.100]   Goat is...
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   People say what's just...
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.380]   It's the most widely eaten meat in the world.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.380]   It is.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.380]   And it is mild.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.380]   Is it like bleeding?
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.380]   It's like mild lamb.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.540]   It's like mild lamb.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.540]   It doesn't even have to.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.540]   You enjoy this.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.540]   Goat flavor.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.500]   It's coming out April 1st on Steam, the goat simulator.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   Have you seen the video on it?
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   Wow, what a segue.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.260]   It's a new game.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.900]   I know it's April Fool's Day, but I think this is real.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   It is real.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   I know it's amazing, yeah.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   Isn't this...
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.900]   You've seen this?
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   I have.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.900]   It's fantastic.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.900]   So this is a take-off I'm told of another game at...
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.900]   Dead Island.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.900]   Dead Island.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   Called Dead Island.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.180]   But of course, instead of, you know, a marine with guns, you're a goat.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.420]   Instead of zombies, you're a goat.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.220]   Is it a zombie that the goats are placing or is the goat the hero?
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.580]   No, the goats the zombie...
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.940]   So it starts off with a woman or a person.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.100]   This is falling backwards in time, obviously.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.100]   Right.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.100]   I mean, you should probably watch the Dead Island trailer.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.620]   That was an amazing trailer.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.300]   The game wasn't that great, but the trailer was amazing.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.060]   So the goat is the zombie.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.500]   It's actually the, I think, the father of...
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.460]   The goat has a jet pack apparently.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.340]   So there's that.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.140]   It's a simulation, Leo.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.420]   Watch this.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.220]   We find out where this all began with the exploding gas station.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.260]   The goat apparently caused a gas station to explode.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   That's a goat's dew.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.820]   That's goat's will.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.980]   Goat simulator, it's a very affordable only $9.99 on Steam April 1st.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   Just a little...
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.980]   That's not an ad.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   I just see there's the goat and the gas station.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   That's how it all began.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   Should have gotten paid.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.980]   Is that weird?
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   Yes.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   It's amazing.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.980]   It's other than the other.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   That is confusing.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.980]   I run into it.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   I feel we're at now.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   I'm not.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   So that's real.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.860]   That's going to be a big game.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   I know there's a market.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.020]   I see it from my generation.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.020]   I do.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.020]   Why?
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.020]   That's great stuff.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.020]   That's creative.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.020]   You're right.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.020]   It's up there with Picasso.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.020]   How?
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.060]   Not everybody could be a Picasso.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.060]   Some people will be goats.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.500]   For every Picasso, you need a bit of funny graffiti.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.460]   A goat on the bull.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   Oh.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.460]   John, could you bring me my iPad?
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.700]   I wanted to show everybody the exciting new software from Microsoft.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.140]   It's called Office.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140]   Perhaps you've heard of...
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.140]   It's on the promoted.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.140]   Are they advertising?
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.140]   Yeah, they're advertising.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   This is not an ad.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.140]   You should be doing that in a bit of advertising.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.140]   I already were trying it out.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.460]   His headline was "Thanks to Microsoft Office for iPad.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.100]   I got absolutely nothing done."
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   Isn't that funny?
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.780]   Because it's productivity software.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.780]   Or...
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.780]   Actually, I think they did a pretty good job.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   You liked it?
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.300]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.460]   So let's take a look.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.460]   I hope it's on here.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.460]   Oh, it is.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.940]   You know what I have to do?
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.940]   Okay, so a couple of things.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.100]   First of all, I'm going to sign in to my Office 365 account, which I pay like $10 a month
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.940]   or $99 for a year.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.220]   And you get Office on five computers, Mac or PC, and five tablets.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   That's a pretty good deal.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.580]   Office, in this case, means...
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.140]   Five computer's five tablets.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.660]   You're saying 10 machines?
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.220]   Five computers, five tablets.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   Okay.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.580]   And any mix of platforms.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   Any mix?
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.060]   Yeah, so it could be a mix of NPCs.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.060]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.580]   And then any mix of those.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.580]   Let me...
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.580]   I got to get my...
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580]   Oh, no, I know it.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.580]   Sign in.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   So I am...
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.580]   So you're going to do...
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.860]   So it just went out, by the way, just in case you were wondering about that.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   My what...
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   If anybody can come here and take...
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.060]   It's because they find my tablet.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.060]   If they find my tablet...
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.700]   Yeah, I don't really care about my what could go on.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.500]   I do care about my Microsoft password going out.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   We couldn't...
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.500]   What is it?
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.300]   I should give them the Gmail address, should I?
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   That's probably the...
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.300]   They don't mind.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.740]   They said we couldn't find an address with that.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.740]   I mean, Outlook.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.780]   Okay, so you've got this thing running off as...
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.780]   Tim, you've played with it.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.780]   Tell them a little bit about what I want.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.260]   Would you do writing and other things?
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.260]   They do.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   Very computer oriented.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.260]   Would you use that instead of...
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.260]   I would not.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.260]   No.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.260]   No, but...
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.260]   Okay.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.260]   For me, that's not what it's for.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   It's more about being able to make quick updates to like...
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.740]   If you have a presentation that you want to give, for example, it's a lot easier to carry
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   that into the room than to carry your laptop a lot, especially if you're traveling.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.300]   But the nice thing is you can use that read only for free.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.660]   So if you have documents in the cloud that you just need to read or you just need to
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.660]   look at quickly...
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.020]   What do you mean using Google Docs for that?
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.020]   You can open Microsoft...
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.180]   See, Google Docs on iOS is pretty terrible.
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.620]   You can kind of power in Google Docs that you do for the flaged office.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.620]   Right.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.620]   Right.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.460]   So you've got full power office on there, which is if you do want to make updates.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.980]   But certainly if you just don't want to do read only stuff, you want to take a look at
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   presentations.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.940]   If you want to give a presentation through your iPad, I can do it for free, which is I
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.540]   think a very nice feature for sure.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:47.060]   And in fact, seeing that found kind of a way around paying for it, which Microsoft said,
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.540]   well, we just hope people would year to wear a license agreement.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.180]   They're apparently not going to shut that down.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180]   You have to go to see that document.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.180]   This would be going...
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.180]   Yeah, I'm not going to tell you.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.340]   This would be going a lot faster.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   Why not?
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   Just tell us.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.980]   If I didn't have to do it in Korean...
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.340]   We'll go change it back.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.340]   I can change it back.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.420]   I memorize where the little markers are.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.620]   I enjoy learning about other cultures as I do the show.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.620]   All right.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.380]   Now I've done the login.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.620]   So it's a bit of a challenge.
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.460]   What is this thing you've have hooked to your iPad?
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.460]   This is my stand.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.620]   It turns it into like just a little...
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.620]   See, isn't that nice?
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.620]   It's a doohickey.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.420]   It's the same material Gecko's have on their feet.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   Let's see.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.140]   No, I'm right now doing a demo.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.060]   And after I'm done, I'll let you see it and change it to Korean, because I know that's
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.420]   what you really want.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.020]   So this is Microsoft Word.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.780]   The main thing is fidelity, right?
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.580]   You're actually going to get something that's...
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.900]   I could open this in Google Docs.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.380]   It isn't going to look like this.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.740]   I could open it in pages if I've bought iWork, the Apple product.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.620]   Anybody who uses Google Docs on pretty much any mobile platform knows that it's very powerful.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.980]   In fact, we use it a lot at CNET, but in terms of formatting, in terms of presentation,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.940]   it's nowhere near as nice as office or as the various Apple products, the iWork products.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.340]   Well, and you may be forced to use office, so they have that compatibility.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.340]   I said that.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.340]   Look, I realize that Apple...
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.300]   I mean, iPad users aren't going to probably, in most cases, go crazy over this.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.820]   But I have to say, I am impressed by the...
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.180]   For instance, they've got ribbon functionality without taking over the screen.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.660]   The touch targets are a little small.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.260]   This has always been a problem with Windows 8 as well.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.380]   But usable, you see how small that is.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.660]   I have a big fat finger.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.860]   It's kind of hard to hit some of these.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.100]   And I think the ability to have an iPad with you, a lot of people with iPads have keyboards
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.100]   now.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.100]   And to get some work done is not...
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   There are going to be a lot of...
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.640]   I wouldn't be writing my memoirs on their bad news, but if I had to make an update to my
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.380]   memoirs, perhaps I would do that on there quickly on the plane, that kind of thing.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.940]   And certainly battery life on there is a lot better than on your laptop too.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.660]   I think this, to me, signals a little bit of a seat-changer Microsoft.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.340]   I think that one of the things, and one of the reasons Satyana Adela wanted to start
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.940]   this event, they did it on Thursday in San Francisco, a week before build.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.860]   And I think one of the reasons he really wanted to be there and do it separately from build
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.380]   is I think that this is not something that would have happened.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.140]   In fact, it didn't happen under Ballmer and Gates.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.620]   I think that they were very protective of the Windows franchise and the Office franchise,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.380]   that the internal groups there were very tough and protective of that.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.020]   And they didn't want, for instance, to offer Office on an Apple platform.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   They were very reluctant to do that.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.340]   And Ballmer didn't want to give up 30% of revenue on any Office sales, which is something
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.940]   that apparently Ballmer was very, very adamant about, but now very quickly after.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.940]   Here we are.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.940]   And they are indeed selling it on iOS.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.220]   You can subscribe to 365, and we've heard, I think, it was Recode who had that first,
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.380]   that indeed Apple gets the 30% cut.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.420]   So I think what's happening is Microsoft, it's kind of a new gentler kinder, Microsoft
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.740]   to Microsoft, that sees itself more as a services and cloud provider.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.620]   Because one of the things this works best with is OneDrive.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.580]   If you have your documents on OneDrive, you're working on them on the computer.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.940]   They're available immediately on the iPad and vice versa.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.700]   You can round-trip through OneDrive.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.460]   And I think that that's a big part of the selling point of this.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.860]   Just like Google Docs, it's really about Google Drive.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.780]   I think Microsoft might finally be saying, all right, we get it.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.380]   It's a diverse world.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.900]   It's a bring your own device world.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.140]   There are people who have iPhones.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.140]   There are people.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.220]   Remember Bill Gates wouldn't let his kids buy an iPod or an iPhone?
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.980]   They wouldn't let him have it in the house.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.540]   They had to use a Zoom.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.540]   They had to use a Zoom.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.540]   And when that's not too good.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.540]   Good quality.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.540]   She said, "It sounded good."
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.540]   "Bring me my iPad."
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.540]   This was his iPad.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.700]   Not just, you know, the demonstration iPad.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.700]   You understand?
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.700]   "Bring me my iPad."
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.260]   Is a message, I believe.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.260]   Absolutely.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.980]   Anyway, it works nicely.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.340]   It's beautiful as well designed.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.140]   I think it was interesting.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.860]   I expected that he would talk a little bit about, oh, and don't worry, this will be on
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   Windows 8.1.2.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.700]   There will be a touch-forward modern UI version of this.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.540]   He didn't mention it.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.060]   Even though we know it's in the works and it may even be a related code base, he didn't
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.060]   mention it.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.060]   And I thought that was interesting too.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.300]   I think this is an acknowledgement.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.220]   It's not a Windows-only world anymore.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   Sounds like surrender to me.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.900]   Do you think it's surrender or just acknowledging the facts?
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   That's a new guy.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.900]   He's trying out some...
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.900]   He's on ideas.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.940]   There's no way Microsoft can continue to say, "We're going to be the Windows and Office
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940]   company."
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.940]   I mean, they've got Azure.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.940]   That's a great product, I guess.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.940]   I guess.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.740]   I'm just really excited to see what they announced at Build.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.740]   It's more of a developer-audience.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.740]   You're going to that.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.740]   You can't go to that.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.740]   I can't go to that.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.740]   I have things to do, but...
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.740]   Going to what?
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.740]   I'm just going to get...
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.740]   Build Microsoft.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   Build the developer conference coming up next week.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   Jim's that's what Tim's in town for.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.740]   I'll go with that.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.740]   I'll go with that.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.740]   Report back.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.740]   I will certainly report back.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.260]   In fact, we are just a program note.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:45.020]   We're not going to be doing Windows Weekly on its regular day this week on Wednesday
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.340]   because Paul and Mary Jo are in town for Build, and we're going to do a special Windows
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.180]   Weekly Friday afternoon.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180]   You're invited to come by.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.180]   Email tickets@twit.tv.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   First rounds on me.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   This is me.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.180]   That goes stuff is weird.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.180]   Whatever this...
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   Yeah, you can pry it off.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180]   Climb the wall with that stuff.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.180]   I'm going to put it on my shoes.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.700]   Another program note, as long as I'm mentioning this, instead of Windows Weekly, this will
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.740]   be the first week, April 2nd, we're going to...
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.100]   I'm going to host a special hangout with Vince Surf.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.100]   Wow.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.100]   The father of the Internet.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.100]   That's great.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.100]   He's doing this effect.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.100]   You can sign up at google.com/takeaction.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.220]   Vince, as you know, is a Google employee now.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.220]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   He's so kind.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.220]   It's funny.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.780]   It hurt to hear that.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.580]   But at the seat, there's no damage to the bag.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.580]   And...
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.580]   The man is a genius.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.580]   He's such a great interview.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.580]   He's a sweetheart.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.580]   He's very down at Earth.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.580]   He doesn't make you feel stupid.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.580]   No, I love him.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.580]   Or like you're bad at math.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.580]   I love him.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.580]   I love him.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.580]   I love him.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.580]   I love him.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.580]   I love him.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.580]   I love him.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.580]   I love him.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580]   I love him.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.580]   I love him.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.580]   I love him.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.580]   I love him.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.580]   I love him.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.580]   I love him.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   I love him.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   I love him.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   I love him.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   I love him.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.580]   I love him.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   I love him.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   I love him.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.580]   I love him.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.580]   I love him.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   I love him.

[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.580]   I love him.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   I love him.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.580]   I love him.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.580]   I love him.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.580]   I love him.

[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.580]   I love him.
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:14.580]   I love him.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.580]   I love him.
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:16.580]   I love him.

[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.580]   I love him.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.580]   I love him.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.580]   I love him.
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.580]   I love him.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.580]   I love him.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.580]   I love him.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.580]   I love him.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.580]   I love him.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.580]   I love him.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.580]   I love him.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.580]   I love him.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   I love him.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.580]   I love him.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.580]   I love him.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.580]   I love him.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.580]   I love him.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.580]   I love him.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   I love him.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.580]   I love him.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   I love him.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.580]   I love him.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.580]   I love him.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.580]   I love him.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.580]   I love him.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.580]   I love him.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:43.580]   I love him.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   I love him.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.580]   You got a ticket to go?
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   Nobody has yet.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   Well, I have a press pass.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.580]   Oh, the registration can't...
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.580]   Yeah, let's show this.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   I'm just going to say something.
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   Somebody spent a lot of time at Google wasted a lot of time.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.580]   So, here's the thing.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:00.580]   Last year, there were a lot of glitches in the registration.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.580]   People got charged for tickets they never got.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.580]   People tried over and over to register and the website got broken
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   because 9,000 million billion people wanted to go to I.O.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   So, this year, instead, they're giving you two days, two leisurely
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   days to sign up for your I.O. ticket anytime you want.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   And then they're selecting people at random who get...
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   They're drawing.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.580]   There's no meritocracy.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.580]   It's like Burning Man.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   It's how first consore serves.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.580]   That's how Burning Man's doing it.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.580]   This is done poorly.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   They should either charge more and let people pay to get into the thing.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   They charge.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   They should stop giving stuff away because that's what causes this to be.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   I think that's why I just have to say that.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   People who's already giving stuff away and see who really wants to go to this thing.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.580]   I love the developer side of it.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   I love going to the little chats and seeing, "Okay, here's what they're going to do next.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.580]   Here's how I can build an app for whatever service or device that they're coming out with."
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.580]   It's fascinating stuff.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   And there are people there who are just not...
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.580]   Well, I mean, they want to be there.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   Sure, they deserve to be there, but not as much as I can.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:03.580]   I think people who go there should be there for a good reason not just to get some free stuff.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.580]   Totally.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   I think is it not unreasonable?
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.580]   I don't know how many people think getting Muscony West, maybe 5,000.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.580]   It's not unreasonable to say there are many, many more people in that that want to develop for Android.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.580]   And why is they're going to have this issue?
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.580]   Why don't they just make the venue bigger?
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580]   Take the bigger Muscony, do it like...
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580]   You know what they did last year?
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.580]   Well, the ones that...
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.580]   Load it up.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.580]   They stream...
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.580]   They did stream all of the content that they not last year.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.580]   Yeah, they did.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.580]   And they're doing that this year.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.580]   I'll send it as well.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.580]   I think if you really want the material, you can get it.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   What people want to do is get together.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.580]   Yes, they want free stuff, but they also want to see their...
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.580]   Yeah, I screw the free stuff in.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.580]   And if you want the material, watching this streaming is not the same as going up to the guy right after his new question.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:43.580]   You know, the funny thing, when you said this, that doesn't make sense because of this.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.580]   And then I guess, oh yeah, because of this.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.580]   You can't do that on a stream.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   I've been playing this front page.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   You don't have to do that, by the way.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.580]   If you want to register, just scroll down.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   That's really...
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   That's the test.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.580]   It's like, okay, if you're like me, you're just going to play the game for hours,
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.580]   hoping that it's your registration to Google I/O, or if you're a smart developer, you're just going to learn this.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580]   Actually, somebody has a great idea.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.580]   Google should just buy Burning Man and do the thing after all.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.580]   Because half the people go to Burning Man at work at Google.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.580]   I think someone...
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   I want to sand in your phone.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.580]   No.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.580]   Alcohol.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   And in other uncomfortable places.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   Yes.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   I might add.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   Yeah, crevasses.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   I would say I think random choice is a little bit better than what we had before, at least,
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:30.580]   because at least hopefully the site won't crash, and it won't be just people's logging on buying 20 tickets for everybody in their company who may or may or may not need to go.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.580]   It's just because they got in first.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.580]   It is sad that they had to go with that route.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.580]   I hate it when people have no control over their own fates, which is usually the case.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.580]   You know who has control over their own fates?
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   People invest in Bitcoin.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580]   That is the future.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580]   Oh my god.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.580]   Yeah, let's talk about this.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.580]   IRS has decided that Bitcoin is not a currency.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.580]   It's property.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.580]   I thought that was a great idea.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.580]   I think it makes perfect sense.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.580]   It's a little complicated.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.580]   So, for instance, I have seven bitcoins in my wallet.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   I need to know what they were worth when I acquired them, so that when I sell them or buy something with them, I can pay capital gains tax on the difference.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.580]   That's how it's treated like property.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.580]   But that does make sense.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:21.580]   There is the onus on the user to figure out what their stuff is worth, but I guess somebody suggested maybe the next generation of Bitcoin wallets could do this somewhat automatically.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   So forth.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580]   I don't have a Bitcoin.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.580]   What it does mean is that the federal government has finally said, "Yes, this is something."
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   Yeah, it's something.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:41.580]   It's funny at VentureBeat, we track all of the venture capital news and the investments in Bitcoin startups are just off the Richter for something that's very, it seems like it's doomed to crash and burn any second now.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.580]   They're pumping so much money into it.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   So much money.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580]   It's crazy.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.580]   Bitcoin miners.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   I agree with you.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:57.580]   The miners will have to include the fair market value of the virtual currency on the day that it appears in their wallet, the day it's mined, as income.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.580]   Ah.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:11.580]   And then that's the basis, their basis, when they use it for something, that's the new value and they have to pay capital gains on the difference between the basis and the final value.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.580]   How many bitcoins do you own?
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580]   7.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.580]   I'm proud owner of 7.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.580]   So you were with $3,500 with the bitcoins?
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   Yeah, it was at one time worth $10,000.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.580]   It's now worth $3,500.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   I should have sold at the peak.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   Yeah, you should have.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   But how do you know what the peak is?
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   That's a good question.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.580]   If you listen to Max Kaiser, the peak is $100,000.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.580]   The Winklevi say 40 and I thought that was bullish.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:39.580]   Here's the thing, you can't quantitatively or even qualitatively understand how it's going to move.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.580]   It's not like any other kind of security where you can make educated guesses.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.580]   There's no fundamental to analyze.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:54.580]   You know, screw it, somebody who's been Bitcoin mining all this time now suddenly has a tax liability, unexpected tax liability.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.580]   Well, and a buttload of money.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.580]   Well, that's true.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.580]   But we must have known this was coming.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.580]   I mean, they should have seen the writing on the wall.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:04.580]   But ultimately, this is going to be acknowledged in one shape or another and the government will want their cut.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.580]   They always do.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   It does seem like a, but I'm not in, I don't have a dog in this time, but it seems like a reasonable interpretation.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   I love this one.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.580]   It's picking up people, minting money.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   King, the creators of Candy Crush had their IPO and the stock dropped 16% of the first day.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.580]   They went off at what, 22.50, ended the day at 19.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.580]   I want to close the week at 18.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   I'm sorry, continue to go ahead and work.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.580]   I thought it was kind of that as it could have been.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.580]   The Facebook IPO was worse than that.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580]   Twitter's IPO was worse.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580]   Was it?
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580]   Both of them dropped that much.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580]   I believe so.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.580]   The, this is a 50 cent stock.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   Sorry.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:45.580]   I think that the stock market is basically saying to King, you're a one hit wonder.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.580]   You've got Candy Crush.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.580]   Well, they got their example over here in the city.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.580]   What's Zinga's down right now?
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.580]   I'm going to look up.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.580]   Zinga's down to a couple bucks a share, I believe.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   It's not a 50 cent stock.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.580]   They watched, I think, almost exactly the same share prices, as a matter of fact.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.580]   And they've dropped, they're currently worth half of their float.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.580]   Zinga's trading at $4.42 right now.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.580]   I think they launched at 22 as well.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.580]   It's a little bit, I mean, it's very easy to compare the two because we've got Candy Crush.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.580]   Versus Farmville, we've got, you know, a very strong tie to Facebook like we had before.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.580]   But one of the big differences here is that King is really focused on the mobile side of
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580]   things, much more so than Zinga ever was.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.580]   Zinga's very tied to Facebook, whereas King's got a much, much bigger, you know, dog in
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.580]   the hunt when it comes to the mobile side of things.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.580]   They've got iOS apps and Android apps, and they're finding good success there.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.580]   But 80 percent of the revenue comes from this one game.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.580]   Right.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.580]   And they, even though they have hundreds of other games.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580]   Significant revenue.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.580]   Six hundred developers turning out the game.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.580]   It's $1.9 billion.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.580]   It's amazing.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.580]   And that's up from 200 million the year before.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.580]   So that's a huge increase.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.580]   It's not an insignificant.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.580]   I take the money.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   Absolutely.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   Ninety three million people play Candy Crush every day more than a billion plays a day.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.580]   It's so many.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.580]   Still, I have never played the game.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.580]   Who are these people, John?
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.580]   Not me.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580]   Tim?
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   Do they have a point?
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580]   I've played it as research only.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.580]   He but Tim plays it.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580]   Research only.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580]   Honestly.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.580]   Honest.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.580]   Honest to gosh.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580]   It's actually strange and compelling.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580]   It's just, it's just, it's just, but do it with a dazzle, right?
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580]   No, it's just, but yeah.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   But you, old game is like a.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580]   You slide stuff.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]   What are you going to have?
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580]   Space and data.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   She knows.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580]   It's Candy.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.220]   That makes you want to do it.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   And then it has a.
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220]   Oh, Candy.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.060]   It's, it's, it's what, I'll tell you what it really is.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.060]   Okay.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.140]   And if they could bottle this, they might have some value.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.820]   It's one of those games that's, these are psychologically addictive.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:32.260]   They're really tricksy in how they reward structure happens, how they get you to post
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.220]   to Facebook to get an extra life.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.580]   They've done it very well.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.140]   And I think there is some value in that.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.460]   If they really understand that value, the value is a deep understanding of the psychology
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.380]   of gameplay and the psychology of game.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.380]   What's the value to you?
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.380]   But it's evil.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.380]   No value to me.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   The value is getting people to waste their time.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.380]   I'm a zombie.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.380]   I'm a hook zombie.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.380]   There's no thought involved in it.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.380]   There she goes.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.380]   There's no empathy.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   There's no connection.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.380]   That's why people like it.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.620]   They're just, it's calming.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.620]   People suck.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.620]   Sure.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.620]   She goes.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.620]   I knew you would be watching TV.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.620]   She doesn't do much.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.620]   Every now and then I don't have a lot of time.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.620]   She's one of those.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.020]   She goes to a Waldorf school and that kind of thing.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.020]   You live on your own.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.020]   I didn't go to school.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.020]   You went to a statler school if you didn't even ask me.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.020]   I went to college.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.020]   I did not go to school.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.020]   Were you homeschooled?
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.100]   Up until a certain point and then I started doing like, I would read books and do videos
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.100]   and stuff.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.100]   But no, I did not go to school.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.140]   Were you a street urchin?
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.940]   Did you pick pockets with a fagant to urchin-ish?
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.300]   I did work when I was a child.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.100]   Did you pick pockets?
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.100]   You don't let him put up with anything.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.100]   This is so colorful.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.100]   Why are you asking me about my childhood?
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:37.260]   Well, wait a minute, because you're an odd person.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.420]   I think that is the greatest compliment.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.420]   You want to be.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.380]   I know I get it.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.540]   I just embrace who I am.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:49.380]   And who I am doesn't like the thought of people wasting their brain cells.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.260]   She's the awful, gently, raw governor.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.300]   And she doesn't like people wasting their time.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.300]   I agree.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.820]   There's not even their time.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.500]   They just grow dull and numb and scary.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   Well, here's some good news.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   Ryan Scary.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.700]   Ryan Seacrest lost in court.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.540]   Well, that's the first time.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:08.540]   I know what.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.540]   He's so good looking.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.260]   I hate him.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.500]   He made, okay, you remember?
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   He made the...
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.940]   Do you know that Seacrest is probably just rolling in dull?
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:17.940]   I mean, this guy...
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:18.940]   Probably.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.940]   Definitely.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.140]   He had a hundred million dollar contract with Clear Channel that's the company that pays
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.140]   me for my stupid radio show.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.140]   What tenth of the amount?
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.780]   He's a man toured by Dick Clark.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   He took over all his properties.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780]   He's essentially...
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.100]   This is not a slouch of a guy to make money.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.100]   Dick Clark.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.260]   All right, a hundredth.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.260]   And he...
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.260]   All right, thousands.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.260]   Anyway.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.060]   Good for you.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.700]   My old producers of Silicon Spinworks would NBCUniversal Jennifer.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.780]   And she told me that this guy, because she works for him too, he comes in and he has
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.940]   a million appointments every day, exactly a half hour.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.460]   He's got to handle her with him.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.660]   To hit the stopwatch, he comes in and they do the briefing.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.020]   Click out to the next meeting.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.620]   Would you want to be him?
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.620]   That sounds like a miserable life.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.620]   I know.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]   Sounds horrible.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620]   And he's just on the go.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.620]   Well, he's making a lot of money.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.620]   Anyway, he decided that to be on the go, he couldn't type on a screen.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.100]   He had to have a BlackBerry-style keyboard.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.260]   So he made the typo.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.500]   You might have seen it at CES.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:20.140]   It was a case for the iPhone 5S that slides on and it gives it a BlackBerry keyboard.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.140]   It's ugly.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   Well, apparently, BlackBerry thought it looked a lot like their keyboard and they sued him
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:33.320]   and Justice Court Judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.300]   typo from the sale of its keyboards.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.300]   I got one.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.300]   You did?
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   Hang on to that sucker.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.300]   Yeah, I should.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   Actually, I gave it to a fan.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.460]   They tried to give me one at CES, but I declined because I had no-
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.460]   I bought it.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.460]   It's a hundred bucks.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.460]   He's doing it.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.460]   Steve Gibson bought two.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.460]   You know what he does?
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.660]   He's worth more than Bitcoin soon.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.460]   Gibson's also got 50 Bitcoins.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   Gibson?
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   He's set.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.460]   You know what he does?
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.980]   He buys stuff he really likes and he puts it in the freezer.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.980]   Gibson's nuts.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:09.340]   I wish I had the Dvorak sound board still because that's a good one right there.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.700]   I want a video sound board.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.740]   Anyway, yeah, if you have a typo, hold on to it.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.900]   It might be worth something.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.060]   I don't see how he could have lost that case.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.220]   Well, it's not over.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.380]   They're going to have a trial now, but the judge felt like it was had enough merit.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.380]   Keyboard.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.380]   If you saw it, it's domed.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.380]   It really looks like.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:29.540]   It's got the same shape to the keys that are really designed to fit your thumbs when
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540]   I'm in the science.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.540]   It's very, very similar.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.580]   Apparently, there was an attempt at a BlackBerry licensing deal, but it didn't go.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.340]   That was their mistake because that was in effect admitting that they were copying it.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   That raised them.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   Ah, that's a problem.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.340]   Big mistake.
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.340]   Yes, indeed.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.300]   Although, RIM/Blackberry should have done this in the first place on the cell, so it would
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   have made some money.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   Good point, Dave.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.300]   I do love physical keyboards, man.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.300]   Do you use a BlackBerry?
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.300]   No.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   You don't use a smartphone.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   That's right.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.140]   I have a Windows phone that I'm using now.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.140]   It's delightful.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.020]   But no, why is it delightful?
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:04.020]   Because it makes other interfaces look primitive.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.020]   I think it is a good interface.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.020]   It's not a bad word.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.420]   It's pretty and twirly and sparkly.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   It's like the Disney Princess of smartphones.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.420]   I'm taking my amains.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   I love this phone.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420]   Oh, here we go.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.340]   You see the pictures I posted of Jolie on my Google+?
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.740]   I don't look at anything.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   I'm actually, I've actually quit the internet long before she did.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.260]   I was the first to quit the internet.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:26.700]   I quit the internet before there was an internet.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.700]   You whippersnap.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.020]   You're not quite again.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.860]   Can I still come back?
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:36.140]   I just didn't want to offend you by inviting you.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140]   No.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   Because I thought, oh.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.140]   It's so hard to offend me.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.260]   I just, I know we've tried.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.260]   God knows.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.660]   No, I just thought, well, she gave up the internet.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.220]   She probably wouldn't want to be on Twitter anymore.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.820]   But you are always welcome.
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.460]   I just, I shouldn't have assumed.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.940]   So this is a picture I took before the show.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.900]   This is the new HTC One, the M8, which a lot of reviewers, Anand, gave it a very positive
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.060]   review saying it's not perfect.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.060]   He would have liked to see an improved camera.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.060]   I'm the battery left.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.060]   The old HTC One is a dog with a battery.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.060]   Yeah, because I gave you my old one.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.060]   They've improved it.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.060]   It's the battery's 13% bigger.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.900]   So 26,000,000,000 bigger.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   Okay, that's the phone.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   The phone's bigger.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.500]   The phone's bigger because it's a 5 inch screen instead of 4.7.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.860]   But also they're using the new Qualcomm 801 chips, which have some really 801.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.860]   Oh, yes.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.380]   It's one better than the 801.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   So, but watch this.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.380]   Look at it.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.380]   So this is the camera.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.620]   I took a picture of Jolie before the show and then I played with it.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.060]   It has a couple of interesting features.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.180]   This is one I like.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.260]   The ability to selectively defocus in software, the background.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.820]   The reason they're doing that is they have two sensors.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:38.300]   So the normal camera sensor from last phone is still there, but they've added the front
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.580]   camera sensor from the old M7 and it's taking depth information at the same time.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.700]   Now, don't you think, John, that's a pretty nice, I mean, it's not a professional.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.180]   Get some bokeh effect out of the blue.
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.180]   Yeah, you get some bokeh.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.060]   So this is a special effect, the motion zoom that I've added.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.460]   I don't know about this one.
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.100]   I think I look like Elvira in that one.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.460]   It has, you know, that's silly, the little paste on things.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.020]   That's dumb.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.180]   This I like though.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180]   This I like though.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:12.980]   You can add falling Japanese cherry tree blossoms or that's dandelions and it turns it
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:13.980]   into a movie.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.260]   Oh, no, that's yikes.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.100]   That turns her into me.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.380]   That was scary, wasn't it?
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.380]   That's a bad effect.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.380]   I think this is anyway.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   I'm actually, I'll review this one before you buy it on Tuesday.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.380]   Can I see it?
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.740]   Yeah, you played with the HTC one.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.740]   It's in Korean now, unfortunately.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.020]   Do you want me to fix that for you?
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.020]   Yeah, could you?
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   If you could figure that out, I'd be sure.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.020]   It could be a surreal equation.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.780]   The one complaint I've heard people say about that, who've had some time with it, is that
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.340]   it's actually, it turns out the hardware is even more slippery than the last one.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.940]   And a lot of people had issues dropping the last one because it was kind of round and
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:46.940]   kind of hard to hold on to it.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940]   That one's even more in it.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.540]   It's a slippery, brushed metal.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.340]   They should put the gecko stuff on it.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.580]   Well, you could never put it down.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.700]   Yeah, they make the silliest case.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.260]   Have you seen the dot, what is it called?
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.260]   The dot view?
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.860]   It's like a light bright.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.620]   You talking about the gecko guys?
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.740]   No, this is a case that HTC One is making.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.140]   So what it does is, and I don't think this is going to save you any battery life.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.860]   It turns on the magic of colored light.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.900]   The case has dot holes in it in the front.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:22.420]   And then the screen knows because of the magnet in a case that the dot view case is
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   on it.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.700]   And it shows the time, the date when calls come in through the holes, it looks like a
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   light bright.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.180]   It's the strangest thing.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.380]   It's a great idea.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.380]   But at least it's unique.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   It is.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.020]   The problem is most people don't like flip cases.
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.820]   Yeah, I don't want a case on this.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:40.780]   But the reason I bring it up is John, yeah, John didn't want to drop it.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.700]   This would keep it's got a little rubberized texture.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.340]   Actually, it comes with a little case in the box.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.980]   There's a little shell case.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   So maybe they acknowledge it.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   But look at that.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.660]   See, it shows the time as the alarms go off.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.500]   If you swipe it, but it looks like it's weird because it looks like a light bright.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.500]   It doesn't.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.900]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.100]   Isn't that bizarre?
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.100]   That's different.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.100]   You're right.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.100]   I like it that they're trying something different.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:07.060]   You know, I almost want to plug this phone just because I want this plucky little company
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.060]   to see.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.060]   Yeah, I think we all do.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.060]   And they're really on the edge, frankly.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.060]   I don't think that.
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.060]   Yeah, they're always on the edge.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.860]   That pretty poor public relations going on the way I see it.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.140]   They can't compete with Samsung.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.620]   Samsung spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing every year.
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.060]   It's, HTC doesn't have it.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.980]   And frankly, I've got to say that I've finally come to the opinion that Samsung phones are
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.980]   crap.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:31.420]   You know, that's funny because my stepson Eric, he just does nothing but complain about these
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   things.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   They're crap.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   He says, can you get me a free phone?
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   I say, no, I can't get your free phone.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.380]   I say, I can't get free anything because everything has changed.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.340]   But he's, I don't know, I have a Samsung Nexus phone that is different.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   That's a Nexus.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.340]   Okay.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.340]   That's great.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.940]   I agree with you because that's a Google experience phone.
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.580]   And if you buy the Galaxy S4 Google experience phone, that'll be all right.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   That's a little plastic-y.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:55.860]   They can get the HTC One M8, the new one as a Google experience phone as well.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.020]   Hey, you changed it.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.020]   I fixed it for you.
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.020]   You put it back in English.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.020]   Do you speak Korean?
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.020]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.020]   You're just smart.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.700]   She now, there's no time at all.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.700]   She recognized the items.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.700]   I didn't do this.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:07.700]   No time.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.700]   No time.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.700]   No time to launch.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.700]   I had to.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.140]   Did you change it from Korean to invisible?
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.900]   No, I don't know what it is to me right now.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.700]   Oh, there it is.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.700]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.700]   Okay.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.700]   It was just rebooting.
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:25.220]   It was, it was probably downloading all the fonts that you had deleted.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220]   Good.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.060]   No, I just, I want them to do well because I want the competition.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.260]   I feel like Samsung has become a behemoth.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.260]   They're a bully too.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.260]   And they are a bully.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.980]   And Android device that has aesthetics as a priority.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.660]   Whereas with Samsung, with so many other Android devices, aesthetics are very much a second
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.700]   or third or fourth or fifth thought.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.220]   Performance and battery life are really the leading things that most Android buyers look
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.220]   for.
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.500]   Whereas with the one that obviously spent a lot of time with the design and the engineering,
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   which is very nice.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.300]   But unfortunately, I mean, the one sold really well for HTC, but it didn't sell anywhere
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.620]   near the Galaxy S4 or of course any of the iPhones.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.180]   Do you think they made, were they able to make money anything?
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.700]   From what I've heard, they did okay with it.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.700]   Okay.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.700]   But I don't know that they did enough.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.380]   HTC had so many devices that were doing pretty well for them before.
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.460]   And now they've got, you know, this is pretty much the one that they're hanging their head
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.500]   on, whether it's enough.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.700]   And I honestly, I don't know that there's enough change here to really convert anybody
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.700]   who didn't like the HTC One.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.700]   Yeah, if you didn't like it.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.220]   Although they did do one thing that I really bothered me, they fixed, which is they've
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:25.420]   now got the Google screen buttons, the capacitive buttons.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.660]   HTC did a non-standard two button thing, which was very confusing.
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.660]   But now they've got the standard.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.980]   So in fact, Sense 6, which is the new Sense that's on this, is actually very good.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   They have the Blink feed.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:39.340]   They've updated that to do a really, I think a really good job.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.340]   Oh, there's so much crap.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.820]   And it's crazy they're pushing that back to the other devices too.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.780]   And you can get Blink feed now on other devices if you like it.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.780]   If you like it.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.780]   And I've always loved the Zoes.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.060]   You know what I think is really exciting?
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.060]   What do you think?
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.220]   Which Windows fund do you have by the way?
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220]   I don't know.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.220]   Okay.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:03.460]   It's really exciting to look at the burgeoning group of low-end smartphones, like the Firefox
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:09.340]   OS phones, the LG, whatever it is, mini that came out where they're sort of a smartphone,
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:14.740]   sort of a dumb phone, cheap to manufacture, cheap to buy, and they conserve power very,
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.900]   very well.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.660]   And then you have applications like WhatsApp that helps them conserve data as well.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.660]   Right.
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.140]   I think that is where all the growth in the world is going to happen, literally in the
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   world.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   I like the Nokia 521, which is their low-end Windows phone.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.180]   But of course, Nokia decided to do Android.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.580]   And they've got the ASEAL line as well.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.140]   And these are very big in the developing world.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:41.980]   I don't know that I mean a phone you can buy for 50 bucks that can change lives.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.980]   I agree.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.060]   In ways that aren't scary.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:51.700]   This will be the first build with Nokia, by the way, which will make an extra interesting.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.260]   The first build conference this week.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.500]   So will Nokia be there as a Microsoft?
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.140]   They're not yet owned by Microsoft.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.140]   It's a late until April.
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   Is it Nokia conference Wednesday?
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.460]   They're going to do their own thing.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.460]   That's how they'll handle that.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.460]   Okay.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.460]   Now, report back.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.460]   I look forward to it.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.620]   And when we will do a lot of build coverage next week on the show, we're going to take
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.140]   a little break, come back with some final words you're watching this week in tech with
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.660]   the, I told you, did I not?
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.260]   The best panel ever.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:20.900]   Jolio Dell, back from the internet grave.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:21.900]   Interlands.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.900]   Interlands.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.900]   Real world.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:28.100]   Are you considering cutting up the credit cards, disconnecting the phone?
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.100]   No.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.740]   You like that stuff?
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:31.740]   No?
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.540]   Did you think a credit card company knows more about you than Google?
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.220]   Yes, but they have a very different history of what they do with that information.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.220]   Very different.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.220]   You do your thing now.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.220]   Do your thing.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.380]   I'm going to do my ad.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   Okay.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.020]   Tim Stevens is also here from CNET.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.020]   You're doing the car thing.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020]   I'm doing a lot of cars.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.020]   I'm really glad about that.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.020]   That's great.
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.180]   You'll be doing even more car stuff coming up this year.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.860]   I want to ask you what I should buy after the...
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.860]   What?
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.060]   You just bought an Audi A8.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.260]   Oh yeah, never mind.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.900]   I won't ask you.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.900]   You can have more than one car.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.900]   I have a lot of cars.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   I like cars.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900]   He's going to start collecting cars now.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:08.900]   That's the end.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:09.900]   Tim races.
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.900]   Did you know that Tim races?
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.420]   I do race on the ice no less in the winter time.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.820]   Oh, you're one of those guys?
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.140]   The ice, the racing season is over because the lakes aren't thick enough to start.
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:19.140]   Why?
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   I know that ice racing in cars is hilarious.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.140]   You've got a car.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.140]   You've fixed up a triumph.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.620]   I know it's a Subaru that I race in the winter.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.100]   It's actually quite funny to watch.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.660]   Do you have snow tires, chains?
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:29.660]   I studied snow tires.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:30.660]   I studied tires.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.660]   So you do have traction.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.660]   You probably have a race with low traction.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.740]   It's kind of like watching these guys race these things in the ice.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.220]   It's like watching a Greyhound race if you've ever been to a track.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.660]   Because they have to time one of the dogs falls and they all fall all over the place.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.660]   It's a mess.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.660]   Is it anything like a tractable?
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.660]   It's like sitting around floating around.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.660]   I'm going to...
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:50.660]   It's sophisticated.
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660]   Same audience.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.700]   But we'll get the video in a second.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.700]   And also Dvorak is here.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.700]   I don't know why.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:56.700]   Dvorak.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.700]   No agenda show.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:58.700]   No agenda show.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.700]   Dot com.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.580]   Dot com now twice weekly for your enjoyment.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.020]   Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.020]   I know tax time.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.220]   Oh, this is terrible news.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.980]   Two weeks away.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.420]   Two weeks from Monday.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.900]   I just filed.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:23.780]   It would be so much easier if you didn't have that shoebox full of papers printed in voices.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.860]   Would it be nice if it were all on the computer?

[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.860]   I had to do that.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.220]   That was one of the main things that Fresh Books solved for me.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.980]   And now they're better and better.

[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:03.260]   John C. Devorak, I didn't know you liked hookahs.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.260]   Hookahs.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.620]   Actually that is a Price Club bottle of vodka.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:07.620]   How big is that?
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.620]   It's just Kirkland.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620]   This is Costco, not Price Club.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.980]   Oh gosh, it is Kirkland's brand vodka.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:17.300]   Yes, and for insiders because you always want to tip every once in a while people out there.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.620]   Love those liquor tips.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.020]   This is Grey Goose.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.020]   What?
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   Yes.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   No.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.020]   They just put a Kirkland sticker on it.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:28.060]   Grey Goose makes a crap load of this stuff for them.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.180]   Grey Goose is supposed to be a good vise.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.180]   I don't know how you can tell it.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.180]   It is a different solve vise because it's the same.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.500]   It's still the giveaway here as Chris says, made in France.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.580]   But if you actually grill the company about it, it's Grey Goose.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.580]   Wow.
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.580]   And it's like one third device.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.580]   So stop buying Grey Goose and start buying Kirk.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:43.260]   Yeah, but this is a better bottle.
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260]   The big heavy bottle.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.260]   Certainly larger volume.
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:48.420]   That's a 1.75 or something like that.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   It's huge.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   It looks like a Magnum.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.420]   It's a Magnum of vodka.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.420]   So where can I find the...
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:54.420]   It's on YouTube?
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.420]   You can come in and put a link somewhere.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.780]   Yeah, just tell me what to search for.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   Search for Adirondack Ice Race.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   Adirondack Ice.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.780]   I just love the name.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.420]   Have you ever won a championship?
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.900]   I've won many races.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.500]   Do you wear a bunch of patches all over yourself?
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.500]   No, I get it.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.500]   Not round one.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.300]   He won a Corolla Lake.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.860]   Are you in that one?
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.500]   Is that the Adirondack Motor Enthusiast Club?
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.380]   Oh, look, Tim posted this on his YouTube.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.940]   So does this a GoPro or something you have?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.940]   This is a GoPro sitting in the car.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:23.940]   Yeah, we're right now.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.540]   You're on a frozen lake right now?
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.540]   On a Corolla Lake.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.340]   So if we go a little further up here, this is on the excitement.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.660]   Space can start it.
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:32.660]   It's a little bouncy.
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.020]   Well, lakes are not as smooth as we think today.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.020]   They would be like ice.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.580]   No, they're actually very bumpy.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.460]   So we're actually getting air sometimes when you're going on this trip.
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.820]   It's great because there's so many big cracks.
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.820]   It's just snow on?
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:44.660]   No, it's because the ice cracks, the shifts, and then freezing again.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.700]   And plus, there are lots of ice fishermen out there.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.700]   They'll dig holes in the ice.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.300]   And every now and again, you'll hear one of the holes, which will do best.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.300]   How do you see?
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   So the course is marked.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.300]   It looks like with cones?
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.300]   Is that?
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.300]   The cones, yep.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.300]   And we are wheel wheel.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.300]   You can see them coming up on an Audi here, trying to pass them.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.300]   Oh, those Audis, they got a pickup.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.300]   There he goes, bye-bye.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.300]   You own an Audi.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.140]   I know, I love it.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.300]   But it's the Quattro that you want on these races.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   You got a four wheel.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.780]   I'll go drive them to get them all in this trip.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.780]   So what's your car?
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.780]   What is this car?
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.780]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:14.780]   Is he spinning out there?
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:16.260]   No, just the tail out.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.260]   You hang sideways?
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.260]   It's drifting, we call it.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.420]   It is drifting, yeah.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.660]   This is drifting with very low green.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.060]   There he goes, both of you.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.380]   Oh, and now you can't see, so that's dangerous.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.380]   It is.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.820]   I've driven in blizzards like that, but...
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:30.820]   Just like that.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:35.340]   It looks like it is the most incredibly fun thing that you can do to car.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.420]   Have you wrecked it ever?
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.860]   I did get hit finally.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:41.300]   I've been doing this for years, and I just got hit finally for the first time this winter.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.180]   I unfortunately spotted myself and got hit by a sob.
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.820]   Yeah, it wasn't too bad, actually.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:46.820]   What's your worst thing?
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:47.820]   Oh, it seems a man.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.820]   Amanda, you don't mind that he does this?
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:50.820]   No?
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.820]   Have you ever done it?
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.820]   No.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.820]   How fast you actually end up getting?
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:55.820]   I...
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.820]   We are in the...
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:57.820]   Is it like insurance policy really good?
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:58.820]   We get up to about 80 years ago.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   Okay, there you go.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.820]   Wow!
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.820]   You're kidding!
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.820]   Somebody asked him, "Jad, do I double clutch?"
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   Yes, I think double clutch.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.820]   Oh, you do?
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.820]   You're one of them.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.820]   I have an older Toyota, which has a full-on transmission, so you kind of have to double clutch.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   That's a technique though, right?
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.820]   It is a technique.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.820]   Do you ever like pull the handbrake at the same time as you?
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.820]   I have an older Subaru with a Viscus center.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.820]   This is getting really technical.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.060]   It doesn't really work very well on my car because you could pull the handbrake at locks and
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.060]   pull the handbrake at all.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060]   Oh, you don't want to lock?
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.060]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.060]   But if you have...
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.060]   I have an STI as well, if you pull the handbrake on that, it disengages the center.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.060]   I'm bringing my Mustang, because that would...
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.060]   Yeah, you can drift in that great spot.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.060]   There's a two-wheel-draw class.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.060]   Should it come in?
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060]   Is there?
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.060]   Drive it up to New Hampshire.
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.060]   No, it's upstate New York.
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.060]   Why don't they call it Northern New York?
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.060]   They call it Upstate.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.060]   I don't know.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.060]   It should be Northern New York.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   They got Northern Virginia, Northern California, but no.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:54.060]   Nobody says upstate Virginia or upstate California.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.060]   I live in upstate California.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.060]   I'm going to say that from now.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:01.060]   You know the start, though.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:02.060]   This is not upstate.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.060]   Well, North New York, to me, sounds like you're talking about somewhere in Manhattan.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.060]   Yeah, that's up-town.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.060]   Yeah, and most people think that anything north of...
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.060]   No, they like you, too.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.060]   Which always makes us very irritated upstate.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.060]   So there was a kind of...
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:19.060]   I don't want to say nutty, lady, but she was kind of nutty.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.060]   She was digitizing...
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   I mean, recording, not digitizing.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.060]   That's part of the problem.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.060]   Which lady is this?
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060]   Marion Stokes.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:29.060]   She used to work in TV news when she got out of it for decades.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:36.060]   She recorded every on-air broadcast in her home on a VHS recorder on several.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.060]   How many tapes did she have to buy?
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:42.060]   40,000 tapes VHS and earlier before that Betamax.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.060]   I think she broke the little tabs out so you couldn't take it anymore.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.060]   You want to see what they look like?
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:50.060]   They look like exactly what you would think they look like.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.060]   Rotten bubble tape.
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.060]   Oh, man, that takes me back.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.060]   What are the break-mixs?
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:57.060]   See, that looks like high school to me.
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.060]   So he has.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:01.060]   Here's one news, Saturn Pictures from August 81.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.060]   So she's an archivist.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.060]   Some might call it that, some might call it a hoarder.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:08.060]   I would say because it's organized as archiving.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.060]   Big difference.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.060]   I'm sure she considered archiving absolutely.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.060]   So what's the criticism of her?
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.060]   There's no criticism of the world of...
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.060]   The word is in favor.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.060]   Well, in fact, the internet archive thinks exactly that.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   They have started digitizing all 40,000 tapes in the internet archive.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.060]   So you're going to see 60 episodes of input.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   That's the name of the program.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:38.060]   You're going to see local news.
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:41.060]   You're going to see...
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.060]   The computer chronicles maybe?
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.060]   Yeah, sure.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.060]   Why not?
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.060]   In fact, actually the computer chronicles are already on the internet archive in complete form.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.060]   Stuart Chiffet, we actually interviewed him on triangulation.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.060]   He got those tapes to the internet archive and they got them all up there.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.060]   It's fun to... John's on one of them.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.060]   Yeah, it's a classic.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.060]   If you took a part of computer, you couldn't put it back together.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.060]   No, no, I could put it back together, but it wasn't as easy as it looks.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.060]   Besides that, the thing was meant to be taken apart.
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.060]   And meanwhile, Chiffet is worried sick because I think he has to return it or something.
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.060]   I'm like, "Oh, this thing that pieces..."
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.060]   It's fun to watch those classics, I'll tell you.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.060]   I had hair.
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.060]   We should have had you on that episode with Stuart.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.060]   That was a lot of fun to talk about.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.060]   I don't think you ever liked me.
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:23.060]   Well, we talked about you during the interview.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.060]   Yeah, and he said that guy, something like that.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.060]   No, he said it with... I think he said it with affection.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.060]   Uh-huh.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.060]   Yeah, okay.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.060]   You had those big aviator glasses.
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.060]   They were popular in the 70s, you know, whatever that was.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:41.060]   The internet archive estimates about half a million dollars to digitize these tapes.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:44.060]   They are going to try to raise that money if you want to help them out.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.060]   Archive.org.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:49.060]   There's another guy we interviewed who's wonderful.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:50.060]   The...
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.060]   Brewster Cale.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   Cale.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   Yeah, love him.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.060]   And I love his mission.
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.060]   I love his vegetables.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.060]   He said, "You know what he...
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.060]   Cale, I get it."
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.060]   He said that...
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.060]   I'm not sure he don't like it.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.060]   Copyright be damned, basically.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060]   He said, "You know what?
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.060]   Libraries don't ask what's the copyright of the material we're collecting.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060]   We're a library.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:08.060]   We're going to collect everything.
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.060]   We're going to download all the pages.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.060]   We're going to save it all.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.060]   And it's going to be a treasure trove for historians going forward.
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.060]   I'm not going to worry about the cops.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.060]   No one has sued him.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.060]   Nobody has?
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.060]   No.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.060]   Nobody has.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:24.980]   You know, the problem is, you know, I become a Kindle user because you can read so fast
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.540]   on a Kindle paper white.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.060]   You can double your reading speed.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.060]   Really?
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.660]   Oh, the thing is astonishing.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:34.060]   And so one of the things I like to do is read these classics that there are many who are
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060]   in public domain.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.420]   And so you can get them either in the Gutenberg project or if they don't have them there, then
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.060]   you go to the archive.org where they've been digitized.
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.060]   Horrible.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.060]   Unreadable.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.060]   Sorry.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.780]   That's one of the problems because of course the technology is constantly improving in
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:48.780]   the early days.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.780]   A lot of these techniques were so good.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:55.140]   The thing with Gutenberg project, they took these kinds of scans and then they had people
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.940]   edit the whole thing so you have a book that is really well made.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.020]   You can put it on a, you can get a Moby file.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.060]   You can put it on your Kindle and read it.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.620]   Free ones on Amazon too, but they're pretty bad too.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.180]   The Gutenberg ones are definitely much better than ever.
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.180]   Yeah, the Gutenberg ones are good, but they don't have everything.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:13.860]   So I'm just bitching about that for no reason.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:22.300]   Apparently, Facebook is the source of news for a vast percentage of Americans.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:27.940]   30% of adults get their news on Facebook.
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:32.380]   64% of adult Americans use Facebook.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:37.980]   This is from the Pew survey of, they've been doing this great research on the internet
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.700]   and American life.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.020]   They released a report on Wednesday.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:46.420]   50% of social network users share or repost stories, almost half.
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:49.160]   Share or repost stories, images or videos.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.420]   You know that from the work.org/blog.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.980]   The people want, people like to reshare that stuff and put, you know.
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.300]   How much of it is absolute bull crap?
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.300]   Oh, all of it.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   Yeah, most of it.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:04.860]   And also, I saw one going around the other day that was just absolutely false and the person,
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.340]   all the people I knew who posted it had to go back and say, "I'm sorry.
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.340]   This was a scam.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:09.340]   It was a hoax."
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.340]   So why?
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:14.100]   Yeah, we're living in a scam hoax world.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.100]   It's all a fairytale.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.860]   I missed the days of verified media.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.500]   Oh, yeah, and you think it was that.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   Really?
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500]   More accurate.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.500]   Never existed.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.500]   Never existed.
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:30.060]   In 1999, that's when I started my career in media and I worked at a weekly thank you very
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.060]   much.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   A weekly?
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060]   Did you have a fact of character?
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.700]   You worked as called shoppers?
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.700]   No.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.300]   Did you have a fact checker?
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.300]   Yes.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.300]   Yes, thank you, Jolie.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:41.780]   I've been trying to tell him that for years.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.780]   You too, Lee.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:47.780]   This comes ten years after a study that found that 21% of people under 30 got their news
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:48.780]   from the Daily Show.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.780]   And I remember that coming out.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:51.780]   Is this better or worse?
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.780]   That was a moment in fact.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   I know, sure.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.540]   Well, one thing that Facebook's done, and I think it's bothering brands a little bit,
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540]   they've changed their algorithm.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.540]   They keep changing it.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.340]   Refining their algorithm of what makes it into your newsfeed.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:05.220]   And now it turns out that all these brands have spent all this money building all these
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:06.220]   likes.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.200]   Most of the stuff is not getting into people's newsfeeds.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.620]   So if you're Coca-Cola, you spent millions building a Facebook page and in getting millions
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.420]   of likes, you would hope that everything you post would at least be seen by people who
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:22.700]   liked you very little of it is a small percentage, small fraction of it is.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:26.380]   And I think brands are starting to get a little miffed by this.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.140]   It just means they have to post more.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.060]   That's what we're finding out at VentureBeat.com, the internet website.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:37.300]   Are you studying the importance and the impact of social sharing?
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:43.220]   Oh my gosh, that has been my mission as managing editor to figure out how to make Facebook
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:45.060]   work for us better.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:51.660]   The more we post, the more we get engagement and click throughs and get to talk with, not
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.740]   just at our Facebook fans.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.460]   We post every 10, 15 minutes during the week.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.420]   What percentage of your stories are making it?
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.900]   Do you think to people's newsfeeds?
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:02.540]   Are all of them making it to people's?
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:10.740]   Well, we get engagement metrics and it's not every fan doesn't see every story, obviously.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:11.740]   That would be annoying.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.180]   Well, but it feels like, I mean...
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.180]   But more people are seeing it more.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.180]   Am I nuts?
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.180]   It doesn't seem like that I...
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:18.540]   See, I think of Facebook as I do it Twitter.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:22.340]   When I follow somebody on Twitter, I will see 100% of what they post on Twitter.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:24.900]   I may not see it because...
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:30.900]   But do you want Facebook or Twitter or somebody else to choose which of the posts you see?
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.500]   People's gonna have to choose at some point.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.740]   It can't be just you going through a string of garbage to find the reasons.
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:38.700]   No, I follow my family.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.380]   I follow my close friends and I want to see all of their posts.
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:46.260]   And maybe a brand or two, I really like Wendy's burgers.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.340]   And I would want to see all of those, because their venture be one or more.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:51.100]   You really like Wendy's burgers?
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.260]   No, he likes the advertising, remember?
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.260]   No, they're square.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.260]   That's right.
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260]   Never mind.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.260]   No, whatever.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.860]   But I'm just saying, maybe there's a brand you like that you'd like to see what they
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.860]   post.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:02.860]   I mean, there's a few brands.
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860]   Like Levenger catalog.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.860]   I like what they post.
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.860]   Who's Levenger?
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.860]   Oh, you don't know about that?
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:07.860]   It's a reader's catalog.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.860]   It's great.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:12.140]   They got pens, they got desks, they got lights, it's great.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.220]   Steve Levine founded his friend of mine.
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.220]   Friend of yours.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.460]   He's not advertising on it.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:22.060]   I have begged him to buy ads and he will not do it.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.620]   But anyway, if I like them on Facebook, because I like pens, I have a pen fetish.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:26.620]   You probably do too.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.460]   What you think this like thing is a little ridiculous.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.460]   Oh, it doesn't click.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.460]   I like.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:31.460]   What's wrong with that?
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.460]   It's idiotic.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.460]   It's engagement.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.460]   Don't you want likes?
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:35.460]   No.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.460]   No.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.300]   What does venture be want?
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.300]   Venture be one's life.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.300]   They want shares.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:41.700]   No, we want readers.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:42.700]   We want readers.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.140]   So you want people to click a link page to your site?
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.140]   You want to see it.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   And learn something.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:50.420]   And just face it how well does Facebook work for you on that?
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.420]   Very.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.420]   Okay.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.540]   So the trick is to have them, if you want readers, you don't want someone to just click
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.340]   that link and then go away and then go back again.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:00.420]   So the trick is actually to avert them into come back to your site again.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.420]   And that's a good trick.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:05.180]   We're playing like that long game to do a lot of really good reporting and have people
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.380]   like they get something smart and original every time you come.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.740]   That's what we do.
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.140]   We try to make good content and just trust this.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.860]   People will like it and engage with it.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   Why am I here?
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.820]   Because you're good content.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   You're being exploited.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.820]   Oh, definitely.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.820]   But I've exploited you for years.
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.300]   I know the numbers go way up when I'm on.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.300]   See, you get a value.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.300]   It's a mutual benefit.
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.060]   With Joey venture be venture be venture winner.
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.500]   Go there read their stories.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.500]   Don't read them on Facebook.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.220]   Read at adventurebeat.com.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.220]   There are cupcakes.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.140]   Pardon, Pardon, my tongue is in the face book.
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.460]   Is a single stream more or less?
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:40.100]   I mean, you've got this thing on the right that gives you what's going on right now.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.740]   But by and large, you've got this one.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.380]   So is Twitter shot right down the middle, right?
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.380]   Not for me.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.900]   I mean, if I use tweet deck, I don't know about you.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:49.580]   And I have five separate columns going and different things.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.580]   Right.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.580]   And I can't do that on Facebook.
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.300]   I can't create different columns or different things.
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.100]   You know, well, there's a business opportunity.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   I mean, I follow more than two thousand.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:02.700]   I need 50,000 new Twitter followers.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:03.700]   Why?
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.060]   Because somebody asked and that's what I've, number I've decided.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.380]   What can't you spy them?
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.780]   I'm not buying my followers.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.500]   It's just I just think it's.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.500]   I think it's wrong.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:16.580]   I think my followers, I think most of them are spammers.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   Well, half of them.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:18.780]   There's actually a website.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:21.980]   My role is you look it up and they'll give you the spam number.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:22.980]   Really?
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.980]   What is this internet website?
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:26.980]   It's status.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.980]   Tell us.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:29.700]   Tell us chat room will know because they told me earlier.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.700]   It's.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.700]   I checked it out.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.300]   Mine's 30%, but most are 50.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.580]   It's typically 30 to 50%.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.340]   And that's I've never understood how that works on Twitter.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.340]   This I guess you create a the ideas.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.340]   I don't know.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.580]   There's a bunch of Asians in India and South Asia.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:47.060]   I mean, like this guy, my newest follower.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.780]   Kenji Hayashi two.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.780]   Probably.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:54.340]   It's $84.70 in chat by the way, saying that you can buy him cheap if you'd like.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.340]   Oh, that very cheap.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:56.340]   Kind of am.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.340]   I don't know.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.020]   I'll buy a bunch of cheap ones.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.540]   I think a lot of these people are fake.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.780]   What is the website chat room?
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:06.780]   Do you remember?
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.420]   Is it, you know, a fairness Twitter?
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.420]   What is it?
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.580]   Fakers.s status people.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:14.580]   That's it.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.580]   That's it.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.580]   That's it.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.580]   They want you to subscribe.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:18.580]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:19.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:22.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:23.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   I don't know.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.020]   Oh, do we take it down?
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]   This.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.020]   Is that what Aaron's buying?
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.020]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.820]   I don't know who you're talking about.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:41.940]   Fakers, by the way, we just practically brought it down.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:50.780]   So fake followers check.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:51.780]   24/7.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.780]   Why would he tune in for more of that?
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.780]   I don't know.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:55.780]   I'm talking, I'm singing.
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.780]   Really?
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.780]   You're singing?
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:38:59.780]   She's a rock star.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.780]   You're walking around the house singing?
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:01.780]   She didn't tell you the reason she dropped her.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:05.460]   And the little bluebirds follow me and the squirrels do my chores.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.420]   La-la-la-la.
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.100]   I almost believe that, actually.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.820]   I can just say that.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:11.820]   Just see that happening.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.340]   All right, we're going to wrap this thing up.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.340]   Are you trying to find a woman with a sign in?
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:17.340]   Oh, he's authorizing it.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:18.340]   He's going to see two factors.
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.340]   It's too hard.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:20.340]   I know two factor.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.740]   Tumblers add a two factor.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.100]   Everybody should use two factor.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.100]   What's two factor?
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:29.060]   You have your password and then you'll have a send you a tag.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:32.060]   I have a great suggestion for everybody.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:36.580]   Find one real simple short password like five layers and use it for everything.
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.580]   It works.
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:38.580]   It makes it so much easier.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.580]   I like one, two, three, four, five.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.700]   Yeah, I don't recommend that.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.940]   But I say anything like that.
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.740]   I don't know my Twitter password, apparently.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.740]   It's such a pain in the butt.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.380]   This is not going to work for me.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.300]   I'll just assume that they're all real, wonderful, loving people that follow me on Twitter.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.740]   So all right, we'll wrap it up a week from Tuesday.
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:01.820]   It's XP Am I getting XP Palooza XP Am I getting?
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:04.540]   I haven't come up with a catchy phrase yet.
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:07.220]   April 8th is the last update for Windows XP.
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:08.220]   Microsoft.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.700]   Did you read my column on this where I think Microsoft made a huge mistake?
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.700]   I did read that column.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.900]   You can make billions of dollars.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:13.900]   It's an opportunity.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.940]   It's just for the ATM machines.
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.100]   You don't need it for the public.
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:18.100]   Screw the public.
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.660]   They don't need to use XP.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.820]   But you got all these ATM machines.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.980]   They're using XP and you know some bankers going to say, don't you think we should upgrade?
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:31.260]   They're going to upgrade the entire ATM system that's working to God knows what it's going
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.260]   to go down.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.260]   It's going to be a complete disaster.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.260]   I don't think they are going to upgrade.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.260]   I don't think ATMs.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:36.260]   In fact, Steve said this.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:37.260]   Steve says this.
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:40.380]   I don't think ATMs are a problem because they're not surfing the web opening emails,
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.460]   clicking links and instant messenger, not doing the things that are dangerous.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.140]   Presumably they're fairly locked down.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.140]   I'm not so worried about that.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:54.340]   Much more worried about the half billion unsophisticated XP users and it is almost half a billion.
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.340]   It's crazy.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:57.500]   Who probably won't patch.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.500]   They won't do the right thing.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:01.460]   They won't run as a limited user.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:04.100]   Then the same, "Gee, my machine's slow."
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:10.100]   Yeah, because it's sending spam to 8,000 people today.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.100]   So what do you think?
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.540]   XP get explosion.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.540]   XP lotion.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:17.540]   Exploration.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.980]   All right, Jeffrey Needles, you win the prize.
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:23.220]   I'm going to send you my left sock.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:25.580]   After he wears it for a week.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.660]   Just real Leo fans.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.660]   Expired.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:31.660]   Expired.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.660]   Expired.
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.020]   Are we worried about that?
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.020]   Is that?
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.500]   How many fake followers does OMG have?
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:41.260]   9% fake, 54% inactive, 30% are good.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.260]   That's about right.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.860]   Most people, it's about a third good.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.860]   Really?
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.060]   That's about right.
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.060]   If you're lucky.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:49.660]   Is it good in the same class?
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660]   It's a public-less senior company.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.660]   Yeah, which is 50 cents a dollar.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.780]   It's facing an issue, I think.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.260]   One of these days, yeah.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much for stopping by.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.100]   I really want to thank Jolie Odell for being here from VentureBeat.com.
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:05.820]   She is the managing editor.
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:06.820]   Congratulations.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.820]   Namaste.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:08.820]   Thank you.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:09.820]   Namaste.
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:11.780]   The Geek and Me recognizes the Geek and You.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:13.100]   Or the cupcake, whatever.
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:14.100]   That's a geek.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.100]   By the way, thank you for the cupcakes.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.300]   We're going to hand those out to our lovely audience.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.700]   It's just one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.500]   Did you make these cupcakes yourself?
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.500]   Yes, I did.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   Just make your own cupcakes and she's a good cook.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.700]   Watch out for that Michael Donald guy.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.700]   He'll take two.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.700]   Please do.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.220]   John, see you to Dvorak.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.180]   Channel Dvorak, NoahGendishow.com.
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.940]   Great to have you as always.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.580]   It's always a pleasure, Leo.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.580]   Thank you, John.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:38.380]   It's the nicest thing you said the whole show.
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   Isn't that funny?
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:40.380]   It's so funny.
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:41.380]   Yeah, funny.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.020]   Tim, it's great to see you in person.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.020]   Thank you for being out here and a man.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.340]   Is that your wife's name?
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.540]   That is my wife's name.
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.540]   That is, too.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:52.300]   You don't use the name and then ask.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.300]   Good to have you both.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.300]   Good luck with the ice racing.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:55.300]   Thanks very much.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.300]   Have fun at Build.
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:57.300]   Come by anytime.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.140]   If you're still in town, just come back up anytime.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.780]   We're here all the time.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:05.060]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:07.980]   Pacific time, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:10.380]   That's 2,200 UTC.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.380]   Now weekly.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.380]   Now weekly.
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:14.980]   So, there's no reason to miss it.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.980]   If you don't get to see it live, you can always get an on demand audio or video version
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.980]   after the fact.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.460]   Can I mention something?
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.900]   If anybody comes into Petal Duma to watch this show live and he'd come in a little earlier
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.380]   and go down in one of the streets, there's a guitar shop in this town.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.380]   Great place.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.380]   Which one?
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:32.380]   Tall town?
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.380]   Tall town?
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.380]   Very good.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.380]   Unbelievable.
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:37.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.380]   It's really top shelf stuff.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   There must be a million guitars in there.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.980]   Because we're the cool kids.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:44.980]   I guess so.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.980]   I didn't know that.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:46.980]   I thought that was our little local secret.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:47.980]   Thank you.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.780]   It is a great Subaru dealership though.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.780]   Okay.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:51.780]   I'm not on the way out.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.780]   On the way out the door.
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:54.780]   I need a new bumper for my Subaru.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:59.280]   So, I hear.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:01.540]   I do wish you will tune in on Wednesday.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.260]   We're gonna have a jam-packed Wednesday.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:06.860]   We will start with coverage in the morning of...
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.860]   In the morning?
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.860]   In...
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:11.900]   In the morning of...
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:12.900]   What is that in the morning?
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:13.900]   830?
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:14.900]   Is it 8?
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   When are we getting...
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900]   When are we doing our live coverage?
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.380]   Very early.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:19.380]   Of something.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:20.380]   Oh.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.380]   Desktop.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.380]   Desktop.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.380]   Amazon.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.380]   Desktop.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.380]   I didn't even get to talk about this.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.620]   This was a very interesting scoop from the Jessica Lessons.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.740]   The information that Amazon might be launching.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:32.740]   And I think they will.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:35.340]   A streaming video service.
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:37.220]   They already have Amazon Prime.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:41.540]   They bought a European service some years ago which they've started to turn into basically
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:42.940]   a Netflix-like service.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.460]   I think this is going to go beyond it.
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.860]   I'm very intrigued with what they're up.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:46.860]   Yeah, they haven't been...
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.660]   It doesn't they directly deny it.
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:50.860]   Not a we don't comment on speculation in rumors.
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:52.780]   They just said no.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:53.780]   This is not bad.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.860]   We will find out 830 in the morning on Wednesday.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.140]   We're gonna cover the announcement because I feel like it's gonna be something big.
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:04.820]   I'm gonna be very disappointed if it's like another Kindle or something.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.820]   We're expecting a hardware streamer.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.340]   I think that's like a Chromecast thing.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.260]   But I do think that we could see a commercial-based streaming service.
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:15.060]   And there aren't really that many players out there that give you premium video with
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.060]   commercials.
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.900]   I mean, YouTube's doing some of that stuff for sure.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.900]   Hulu, of course.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:20.140]   But there aren't really that many.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:23.580]   And that's sort of the model that's worked for everybody when it comes to streaming audio.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:26.540]   All these people launch premium streaming audio services thinking people are going to
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:27.700]   pay monthly.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:31.420]   And then we'll also give them the commercial-based service that they'll just give them a taste.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.620]   But everybody does the commercial stuff.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.620]   They don't want to pay for it.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.940]   So it's an interesting opportunity for Amazon, I think, for sure.
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.260]   How about this for prediction?
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.260]   4K.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.780]   Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.780]   Netflix is gonna do it.
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:42.780]   That'll be something to watch.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:47.940]   Then later in the day, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, our Hangout with Vince Surf,
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.140]   the father of the Internet.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.340]   That should be very interesting.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:56.100]   Our build coverage will continue on Friday with Mary Jofoli and Paul Therrott in studio.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:01.060]   A special edition of Windows Weekly Friday afternoon between 1 and 4 this week.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:02.420]   A very big week ahead.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.420]   Where did Chad run off to, John?
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.780]   He had to take care of his business.
[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:07.780]   He's in the bathroom.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.620]   And to see a man about a dog.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:11.620]   People say that?
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.620]   No.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:18.180]   We say Aaron has to take a very important business meeting.
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.620]   Where Aaron so much has been revealed about Aaron.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.860]   He's gonna be steamed when she gets back.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:27.500]   Now I know why in every previous episode he's a company.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:28.500]   He's always here to keep an eye on her.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.500]   He's keeping an eye on her.
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.500]   He's keeping an eye on things.
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:33.100]   They just come right out.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:34.100]   That's my excuse.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.340]   That's what I say.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.340]   I can't help it.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.340]   I don't have a...
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.340]   Control mechanism.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.140]   I lack impulse control.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.140]   That's your excuse.
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:43.140]   It's my week cerebral cortex.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:45.940]   Well, we're more entertaining when we just let it flu.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:46.940]   That's true.
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:47.940]   Let it fly.
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:48.940]   It's all about entertainment ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:49.940]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:50.940]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.940]   Another Twit.
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:52.940]   This is a man.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:53.940]   Yeah.
