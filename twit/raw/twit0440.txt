[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   No.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   Wrong.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   It's CES week.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960]   And by the way, I got the memo.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.800]   It's international CES and the CES does not stand for anything.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   And did that happen?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.920]   Do you remember DVD when they kept changing the name of it?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.560]   It's the show formally known as the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.040]   Now it's just international CES.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.440]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   Hello.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   In Plaid.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   The lumberjack Devorak.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   Yep.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   Also, it's real.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   Every man.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   Thrilled to have Natalie Morris back from her beautiful New Jersey abode.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   Hi.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.240]   Did you go to Vegas this week?
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.480]   No, I did not.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480]   Did Clayton?
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   No.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.960]   Actually, we both set this one out.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.280]   That's how you know you're a senior technology correspondent, which you don't have to go.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.800]   You don't have to go, right?
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   It's the peons that go.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   Yeah, it starts if you're a little junior cub reporter, you don't get to go.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.360]   And then the day comes, I'm going to CES.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.120]   You do that about 12 times.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.200]   And then you go, I can't wait not to go to CES.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.000]   And then finally, you get senior enough or old enough that you don't have enough.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.480]   Or unemployed enough if you want to put it down.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   Or unemployed enough.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.280]   That's another way to put it.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.840]   You know who is here who was at CES and I'm thrilled to have him on YouTube star Marcus
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.880]   Brownlee, ultimate frisbee player.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.680]   Hey, Marcus, MKBHD.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   You say it so fast.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   I got to get MKBHD.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.560]   I say it so fast in a lot of videos that I forget that people who are new don't know
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   what to stand for us.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.800]   I kind of absolutely on a little bit.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   I'm thinking it stands for Marcus K. Brownlee in high def.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   Exactly.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   I got it.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Yep.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.000]   Already you filed, I don't know, five or six reports from CES already more than 800,000
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   views on YouTube.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.920]   The biggest one though was my kit, 170,000 views for the bag of stuff.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.680]   Well, I kind of teased that a little bit because I was, I was, I have changed a lot
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.000]   of the video gear I've been using in the past couple of weeks.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.280]   I was going to show what video gear I use anyway.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.080]   And I figured CES was a good time to do that because I was bringing a select portion of
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.320]   it to cover the show.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.200]   Is it a DSLR to shoot?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.360]   I could consider it a DSLR.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   I guess it's not a DSLR.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.960]   The C100, Canon C100 is the camera that I use.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.760]   I used to use a DSLR and Canon 5D Mark III.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:40.680]   So this is, this is their $6,000, five or $6,000 kind of Mark III like, but it's intended for
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   video.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.600]   It's video first as great as the 5D is and always will be at video.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   This is still his first camera.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.320]   So having a video first camera with a lot of video functions and video layout body and
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.240]   everything like that is really helpful for shooting, especially the sort of running on
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240]   stuff you do at CES.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.360]   Yeah, but it does use the Canon lenses.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   Yep.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   We have great.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.680]   It's kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.400]   What's the model number again?
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   It's the EOS C100.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   Okay.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   Got it.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   And they announced this, I think it last CES.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.120]   You can see that the YouTube videos are paying some money here.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   That's nice.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   Nice.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.160]   You can get a good kit, but Marcus is still in school.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.320]   You're studying for an MBA, right?
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.560]   I'm majoring in business.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   Business.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   See, this is a smart.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   Yeah, he's not like us.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   This is the future.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   That's all night.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   I'm getting an MBA as well.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   No.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   Well, that's your over the hill.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   What?
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Nothing.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   I didn't say anything.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   So it's over the hill.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   Beautiful.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560]   You look today, by the way.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   She's a young woman.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   Did you notice this?
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.040]   Is it going on and on about how gorgeous she is?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   I think you're gorgeous too, Marcus.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040]   Well...
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   [laughter]
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.680]   I just want to be fair.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   John, not so much.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   Me, not so much.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   We're the old guys.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   Now, John, we had all these talks in the pre-show about how not to offend women.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   That's a work.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   He doesn't care.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   That was not...
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   Brought to you by Dots.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   Not offensive.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.520]   So, Kara Swisher and her...
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   Go ahead, Marcus.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520]   You're gonna have bigger Dots.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   He's gonna...
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   You went up them already.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   Hold up your Dots.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   There's a million ways I can go with this.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.160]   That's the world's smallest Dots.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   I refuse to go down that road.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.160]   We refuse to go down that road.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   Holy one up to you.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   Well...
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   We're 30 minutes.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   30 seconds of the show.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   I need to share.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   I need to share.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   From your studio.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   It's not my fault, man.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   You show your little tiny Dots on TV.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.600]   The game we're playing is I hold up something and you have to hold up a bigger...
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.080]   Apparently, Marcus won.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   Like, he won't be able to eat the whole lot.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.200]   I literally just got it.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   I had lunch.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.600]   See, I'm on West Coast time.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.120]   So, I forgot to eat lunch today.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.760]   So, I made the mistake of grocery shopping while hungry.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.240]   Not supposed to do that.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.960]   So, I ate lunch and then continued eating.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.320]   So, now that's why I had lunch.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.520]   That's when you buy the really big packages and tons of stuff.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.320]   You do know that's not food, right?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   Just like...
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   Yeah, just got real lunch.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.160]   I had the real lunch and I was still hungry because it's 9pm.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.000]   It's 9pm West Coast time.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.600]   So, Kara Swisher wrote kind of the article.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.800]   I guess a lot of people wanted to write about CE.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.080]   I'd love to hear your opinion, Marcus, because you were on the ground.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.840]   In which she says, basically, it isn't where innovation happens.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.520]   It's where marketing happens.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.680]   And really, you go here to get bombarded with marketing.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.320]   Were you able, Marcus...
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.880]   This is by the way, on her new recode sonishing.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   She'd come up with something so radical.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   Well, I think it's radical.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   But...
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   It's a sale for dealers, but okay.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.360]   Well, originally, it was a show for dealers, right?
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.240]   And by the way, she doesn't knock it.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.480]   She says it was a great show, but it's just loud.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.560]   And most important, the point I'm making and most points she's making, is you don't
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   go there to see something new, particularly.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.440]   Marcus, did you see?
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.000]   Was there anything you saw that you thought was particularly innovative?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.240]   I would tend to say no, even though a lot of stuff there was really cool and advanced
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.760]   and new in terms of the tech used.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.480]   But I felt like half of the stuff that was really cool and new was just there to get
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.120]   some press and make some noise.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.960]   And it may or may not actually happen.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   So I tend to agree with it.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.480]   And again, that stuff never makes it to market.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.000]   Well, I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They may be fall.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It was when you asked.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It was a release date.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And the price on this, they say.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Yes, maybe.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.080]   Oh, and you know anything that's actually come to market.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.960]   This is my CES decoder.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   If they give you a date of May, that probably will hit the market because that means that
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.400]   it's in the product development cycle enough that they know something about it.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.040]   And it may not actually launch till October.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.960]   But anytime they say April or May, you're like, OK, this I'll actually see.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   So this one.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   But if they say fall, they'll never see that.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   Forget it.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   There's nothing there.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.040]   There's no there there.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.880]   So this is one that was in more in the fall category.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.960]   It was at the Intel booth from a company called Rest Devices.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.720]   And I thought because you have two young children, maybe you have noticed this.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.240]   It's a baby one onesie that's a baby monitor.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.280]   And this to me says everything you need to know about CES 2014.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.800]   It's wearable.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.520]   It has attached lily pad and turtle that connect to your home's Wi-Fi.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.280]   And your kid wears this doesn't look.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.360]   I think the kids going to have a pain in the hip from this because it goes on the onesie.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.320]   It measures respiration skin temperature, body position and activity level and sends
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   it all not only to a smartphone app, but to a mug that mom or dad has at the table at
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   breakfast table.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.200]   And the mug smiles if the baby's happy and frowns.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.520]   This is the worst thing ever.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.120]   This gets the happy fork nomination for the dumbest product at CES this year that got
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.840]   all the coverage, all the coverage.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.320]   This is made for TV.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   It's right.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   Yeah, that's dumb.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   And dangerous.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.240]   Totally dangerous.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   I agree with that 100.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.400]   Apparently you could put it on teenagers too, which is kind of...
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   No, that's different.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.920]   You know, I didn't hear very much talking.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.120]   I was looking for it.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.440]   I was watching all the coverage.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.160]   I felt like if I took a shot every time someone said wearable, right, I'd be wasted.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.760]   But there's not very much research about whether or not that's safe to have on your
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760]   person.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.920]   And personally, I used the Wyvings baby monitor that was announced last year at CES on my
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   daughter.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.960]   And I just started to freak because it was a little too close to her.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.160]   And I thought, I don't know what the repercussions are.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.320]   No one does yet about Wi-Fi being this close to our body.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.920]   And I stopped wearing the Fitbit for that same reason because it's constantly searching
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.000]   for my phone in order to send that data, which means it's going through my body.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We just don't know enough.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.640]   And I know I always sound like the hippie on the show.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   But we know enough.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   Do you think they do?
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   Yes.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   Yes.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   We know enough.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.080]   This is very low power.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   This is not going to happen.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.600]   But when it's searching, it usually has to spike.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.680]   That's exactly my point.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.360]   It's searching for your device in order to send the data to the cloud.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.800]   It's searching for your router or it's searching for the device.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.200]   So how many things can you have on your person?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.440]   And I carry my phone in my pocket all the time.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.360]   And so that's sending signals about where I am and what the weather is and all of that
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   stuff.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.640]   And then you've got the Fitbit on your arm.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.880]   I had the widening next to my daughter's head while she was sleeping and I just freaked.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.080]   So I ended up using the drop cam and put it way across the room so that I can see the
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   whole room.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.600]   So this thing about putting something directly on their hip, that's sending a signal and
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.400]   there are already mattresses that do this.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.320]   There are mattress pads that test their breathing and test their movement and all of that.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.680]   I think that would make you a super-paraner.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.080]   I think there's no...
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.800]   It's conceivable that there's an issue.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:59.680]   There's no... I've looked at all of this research about EMT or not EMT, EMF and Wi-Fi.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.040]   Well, we're being bummed.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   There's no hard advice.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   But there's commonly...
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.480]   There is zero after many many studies.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   That's not true.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.440]   There was a study that was done that showed some correlation with brain cancer and over...
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.680]   Well wait, let me finish.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.960]   And the conclusion was that it wasn't the Wi-Fi at all, but it was the proximity creating
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   a buildup of heat.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   You can't like...
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   Which caused an irritation.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.040]   Can't microwave your brain.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.200]   That's a bad idea.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.240]   I don't think we're at the level of power where your brain is getting heated up.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.120]   Apparently if you're on the phone all day, it's getting heated up a little bit.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.680]   It's not cooking.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   It's just getting heated up.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   But you can...
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   I don't care.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.920]   That's one of the reasons that we're told not to use to not use... not put the phone directly
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.080]   to our head.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   That's even...
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.560]   I mean, the chat room's going crazy and saying...
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   Yeah, they are.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   They're going crazy.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.880]   Right, but this is because it's a pain point.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.480]   Because I'm suggesting that maybe we need to actually distance our person.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.560]   But there have been many, many, many, many studies on this.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   So this is not...
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   But they're not conclusive.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   I've read the same study.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   That means there's no evidence.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   That means there's no evidence.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   That means there's no evidence.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   They're not conclusive because there's no evidence.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.520]   We don't have enough time though.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.680]   Even the decade is too short of a amount of a trial period.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.760]   The show is brought to you by Motorola.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.760]   No, it's not.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   It's just...
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   Okay, anyway.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   So, Marcus...
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.880]   By the way, you just came back from the most Wi-Fi electromagnetic frequency saturated
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.360]   zone in the world.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.760]   If 20 years from now you get cancer, you know who to thank.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   CES.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   CES.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.480]   What else was...
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.200]   So no, no, like...
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.760]   I mean, if the MIMO is the closest thing to innovation, I think that's safe to say.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.480]   Did you... were there any wearables that impressed you at all?
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.720]   That was the term of the CES's year was wearables and the quantified self.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   Nothing too shocking.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.360]   I saw there's the new pebble.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   Most of the...
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.600]   There's been mostly positive impressions about the pebble in general.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.480]   So the pebble steel and their new API and their new app store for pebble.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.440]   So that's at least getting started in a way that may make wearables more interesting.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   What do you think about the pebble?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800]   Do you wear a pebble?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   I don't wear a smartwatch.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.040]   I don't wear anything on my wrists.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.880]   I used to wear... well, I was using the Galaxy gear for a little bit and then...
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   Don't be.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   It's dopey, right?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   Yeah, it's just...
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   It got in the way it's clunky, the way that the electronics are laid out.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   And it's kind of good looking at first, but it just wasn't for me.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.840]   Let's see the idea of the steel.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.440]   That's the idea of the steel is that it's better looking anyway.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.880]   Still completely silly.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   I don't...
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.400]   People love the pebble.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.760]   I think there's a soft spot and I was a pebble contributor on Kickstarter.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.760]   I have my pebble.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.320]   I think it's a little bit of a soft spot for people because of that.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.000]   It was one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns of all time.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.120]   I'm very focused about what it does.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.800]   Like some smartwatches I've seen tend to try to do either too much or they try to be
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.720]   everything in your life, I guess.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.280]   The Galaxy gear has a camera on it.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.360]   I don't know why you need a camera on a watch, you know.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.240]   But the pebble does a certain set of things that seem like good ideas really well.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.040]   I guess they're trying to continue to focus on a certain small set of things rather than
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.480]   spreading it too thin.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.560]   To me, I guess I'm with you, Natalie.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.160]   I don't see any of these wearables being particularly compelling, whether it's Google
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.320]   Glass, the pebble watch, the internet connected onesie.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.640]   No, I like the fitness/mart phone type thing.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   I think that's fine.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.440]   You wore a Fitbit, you said, right?
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   Yeah, the fitness one.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Yeah, I did.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.200]   Like I said, I stopped.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   I just...
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.520]   I won't go into it again if the chat room wants to murder me.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.960]   The Fitbit works because it inspires you to get your numbers up.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.640]   Just the job bone-up did that.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.920]   I used the fuel band because it did that nice little animation when you hit your goal.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920]   That's all it's for, right?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   Just to kind of...
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.120]   Oh, I got to get my numbers up.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.560]   I guess the quantified life.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.120]   It makes you go to sleep because you want to get your sleep numbers.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.720]   It makes you work, you know, it makes me walk more because I can't stand it when Veronica
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.240]   Belmont beats me.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.160]   Yeah, she beats you on what?
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   What game?
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   We're friends on Fitbit, so we're always competing.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.640]   So if she's locked more than me, I don't like it.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   But that's good.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   She gets you more.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   She gets you more.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.560]   Although I'd be curious how many steps we took at CES.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.920]   You didn't count?
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.080]   I didn't have anything on.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   I didn't have a denominator.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   I should have probably installed one of my phone.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.840]   Oh, but there are apps that do that now.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   You can get it in your phone.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.880]   Next is the Galaxy Note 3 has...
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.160]   In fact, the GS4 has it too, has a little pedometer.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160]   Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy, was there.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.200]   He wears a pedometer each year to CES, logs 24 miles in four or five days.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   Nice.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   That's pretty typical, he says.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.800]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.600]   Few miles a day.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.480]   Most of it's just uncomfortable because you're...
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:01.280]   In fact, you know you're in like the upscale booth when you get the really thick carpet.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   Like Intel.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.520]   You're popping around the show and then you hit that carpet and it slows you down.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.960]   But it also slows you down like you're walking in sand.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.640]   It's like, "I can't walk that out."
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.040]   It slows you down because your feet are happy.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.360]   It's funny Fitbit had the one that you put in your bra for a while.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   Didn't they actually have it like the instructions where the woman should wear in the bra instead
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   of keeping the...
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   I'm going to talk a little more about this.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.120]   The Clip Fitbit you could wear in your bra or on your belt.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   Right.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   And I was always dropping it when I...
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.120]   Me too.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   At the end of the day, I'd take off my bra.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   I'd take off my bra and it falls.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   And it would fall...
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   Yeah, it would happen.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.800]   And then I would never find it again.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   I would kick it under the bed or something.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.040]   I lost a Fitbit.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.280]   They need some more boob innovation, don't you think?
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   At CES?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.080]   Now we're talking.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:50.560]   I lost a Fitbit at the San Diego Zoo in Paris in the toilet at home and in a washing
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   machine.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   How does it really pose to the washing machine?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   I can see the washing machine.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   You can't...
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   When you put stuff in it.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.720]   No, because it's on your belt.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   It's on your...
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.360]   You store your belt in the washing machine.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.080]   No, but in this case it was on the pants.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.400]   And I threw it in the...
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.280]   It just happens to me every time.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.160]   I've literally gone through 4 Fitbits.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   Those are the clip-on ones.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.320]   The wristband is not so bad.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.880]   But the wristband snaps on me.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.600]   The rubber is not really well made.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.880]   So as soon as I take it out to charge, it snaps right at the seam.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.160]   That sounds like a piece of crap.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.080]   I hate it when rubber snaps.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.560]   So you don't...
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.120]   Marcus, I was of the generation.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.840]   You were what, 21, 22?
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   20.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   20.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   So you didn't grow up with wrist watches probably, right?
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   Exactly.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.640]   So never really worn one.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   Exactly.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   And that's why I won Walkbrake.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   People have been making a big deal about Apple.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   A lot of this...
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   (laughs)
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   Clock bracelet.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   Yes, I have a...
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   That was the Jack in the Box.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   What is that?
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.560]   Did you invent the clock bracelet?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.400]   I think that...
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.440]   It seems to me everybody's kind of trying to get scrambled to get in this market before
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   Apple does.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.920]   If Apple's gonna suddenly make this eye watch that everybody's gonna go, "Whoa."
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.440]   I think Apple was advised to put it off and then they could see what happens.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   Let them struggle.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.680]   And the problem is you want the market...
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.800]   You want the Marcus Brownleys of the world.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.240]   You want young people who've never worn a wrist watch.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   A wrist watch?
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   You never want a...
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   Yeah, you never want a...
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.400]   Say never want a wrist watch in five times fast.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.960]   All right.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.800]   So is there any wearable that would...
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.440]   Have you tried Google Glass, Marcus?
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.880]   Yeah, I'm a Glass Explorer.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.040]   I just shipped off my version once today.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Oh, you've got an upgrade.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.240]   This swab to Google version two.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.560]   So I mean, that's...
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.000]   I don't wear glass that often.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.920]   When I do, it's usually with a certain purpose.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.240]   Like I intend to record something.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.720]   And so the whole wearable tech thing, obviously there's a lot to talk about it, but I'm just
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.680]   not really into it yet trying to find some...
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.840]   I saw something from Jaybird at CES.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.880]   I was a little unique because it was actually...
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.000]   It was a fitness band, not a clock, but it was more flexible.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   So you could actually...
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It was more comfortable than I guess some of the rigid ones that clamp or clip.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.760]   So I feel like it would be a little less cumbersome.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.400]   It was the Jaybird reign, they called it.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   REIGEN.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   Yes.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.840]   Which makes no sense because reigns that horses have are REIN.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.040]   That's what this is the same thing.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   But it's the star mouth.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   It's a bit...
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   You wear a mouthpiece.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.880]   Mouthpiece wearable tech.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.920]   I think wearable tech is...
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.280]   Most people concluded that this was a flop.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   Dangerous.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   It was a flop at the CES.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   All of it was.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.160]   And everybody talked about Netflix.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.400]   Netflix had did the best job of getting their message out.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.000]   They put their stuff everywhere.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.400]   And now they're going to stream 4K.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.280]   And then they came up with some scheme where they'll pay your bill for bandwidth if they
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   have to.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   This is that 18...
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   We got to talk about the AT&T thing.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   That's a big story.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.200]   What do you guys think about the connected home?
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.800]   It's too funky.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   This app for this refrigerator or this operating system.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.720]   It's not there yet.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   Connected home.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   It's funky.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   It's not only more.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   It's funky.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   I agree with her.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640]   I think I wanted to wear janky.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   Janky.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.240]   It's because there's no unified standard yet.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.440]   What about the X10 or whatever?
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.560]   This has come and gone for the last 30 years and nobody likes it.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.800]   And then there's Zigbee.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.360]   And there's all these standards.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.280]   I don't know about this year, but in many years past it's CES, there's been an entire
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   year.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   Zigbee.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   Automation.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   Home automation pavilion.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.320]   Nobody's got a Senate now.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   People don't want this crap.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.720]   I mean, first thing I would do...
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   I do.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   I like the August.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   Yeah, here's what I would do.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.400]   If you had connected home, the first thing you do is you hack it and you turn the guys
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   heat up to 110.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   That's the first thing you do.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   Come on.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.800]   The nest was a success.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.720]   So there's a marketplace for it if you can do it well.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.280]   We're using the hue, the Philips.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   I love the hue.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.120]   That's so neat.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.840]   But okay, but I got to tell you, I moved.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.920]   I moved and I brought my nest and my hue and I didn't connect up either yet.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   There you have it.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.520]   It's like there was no urgency.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.760]   There was really no urgency.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.280]   It's like, oh yeah, one of these days.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.680]   It's again, it's solving a problem that does, you know, I mean...
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   All right.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   We're talking about solvents.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.840]   Do you have the hue hooked up a Tinky Winky?
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   No.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   Oh no.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.320]   The hue was in Jersey.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.720]   How about the nest?
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   Tinky Winky or Jersey?
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   Jersey.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   What is Tinky Winky?
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.400]   And we're using the Mickey one too, where it's the Mickey ears and you read a story and
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.880]   it's like, you know, the toy story gang was in a tent and then they saw some shadows and
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.440]   the lights dim like when it's at that time in the story.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.280]   It's so cool.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   There's a new app.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   Wow.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   There's a new...
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   There's a new...
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   There's a new...
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   No, the hue.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   It's a cute.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   So let me explain the hue is for Philips.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.920]   You have to buy a base unit with a home, a base station and starter kit and you connect
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.680]   them via Wi-Fi and you could talk them there.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   RGB.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.440]   So you can do any color from the hue.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.680]   There is a new app which John just showed me called Exoplanet for iPhone and iPad.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.560]   And what the app does, you'll like this, it notifies you every time we've discovered
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.760]   a new exoplanet.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   Great.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   That's a...
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   I need to get notified when that happens.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.040]   The Earth-like planet in another solar system is an exoplanet.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   That's a practical use.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   No, but...
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.920]   This is the part I love.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.160]   It ties into the hue and you can automatically see what light on that planet would look like
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.680]   in your living room.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   Oh, fascinating.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   Whoa.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.080]   That's as close as you're going to get to space.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   I love it.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   That's a nice twist.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   That's a nice twist.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   That's the nerdiest thing I've ever heard.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   I like it too.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   That's actually like that.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   That's kind of neat.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   See?
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   You guys should work together.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.760]   Getting into the guy from LG, say the following, talking about the idiocy of the connected home.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.880]   He says, "You know how you had..."
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.160]   This is about the texting product that came out.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.240]   You can text your refrigerator, you can text your washing machine to tell it to start or...
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   This is so stupid.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   Come on.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.440]   He's just walked down the hall.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   You press on.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.800]   Well, he says, "Remember when you had to..."
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   This is the quote.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   I memorized it.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.000]   I used it on the show today on the No Agenda show.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   He says, "Remember when you had to rush home to turn on your washer and dryer."
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   No!
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.080]   No, you never had to do that.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.640]   He says, "This clothes in there rotting as the dryer ready to go."
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.920]   Watch you just turn it on when you leave.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   Who puts the soap in?
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   So stupid.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   Oh, don't tell my mother-in-law that you must never leave the house with the dryer on.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   What if it explodes?
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   Okay.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Yeah, that happened so often.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.960]   The wifi could go through the air, set the clothes on fire.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.320]   The whole thing could blow up and you wouldn't be home to suffer.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.120]   That's the first thing I'd do is hack it and turn people's washing machines on.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   Just let them go.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.160]   It's completely nutty to have the idea that you would want to remote start something that
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.440]   requires you to be there physically to put things into it.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.280]   Yes, with the soap and the clothes.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   I know it's idiotic.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.720]   I've set it all up, but I'm going to wait and start it via text message.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.320]   When I come home, when I'm on our way home.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.000]   Yeah, I know it's idiotic.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.920]   This is the crap we heard in the late '90s about the refrigerated out to tell you how
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.800]   much no, no, I want a refrigerated.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.360]   It will tweet my milk.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.200]   I want to I want to preheat my oven and that's a good one.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   That's a good one.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   I think they don't.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.680]   They also send you a text when you're 10 minutes.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   It's done.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.640]   You take five minutes for when your stuff is done so that you can run home and take it
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   out.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   Well, if you're like if you have one in I don't know a different room in the house and you
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.080]   don't know when it's done or not, it's done on the washer.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   You want to switch it to the dryer.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.240]   You don't know when it's done.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.920]   I have one of these things on my washing machine.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.400]   So cool when it's done.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.640]   It goes beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.920]   I have one of those too.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   I love it.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.520]   Also, the dryer makes noise.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.920]   Dryer's done, yeah.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.320]   I can tell them the dryer's done.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   That's super annoying.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.560]   Torbec says I lost my house to a dryer fire.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.680]   Do not make fun of the dryer fire.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.000]   I've had dryers all my life and none of them ever caught on fire.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.600]   So I think it's a it's a remote statistical anomaly when one does.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   I think you're more.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.200]   I think it has to do with being on an electric or a gas though.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.080]   Which is which is which is which.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.800]   I think the electric is more dangerous than the gas.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.040]   Why would that be?
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   I don't know.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   Let's see.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   I think you're more.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.000]   The bathroom will tell us what the other is more dangerous and just my mother told me
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   to never do it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.600]   Well, it's also more expensive.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.960]   I know Natalie's mom, by the way.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   I'm proud to say.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   I've met her.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.120]   Is it Vernon or now Vernon's Clayton's.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   Vernon's.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   Nat is mom.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.520]   Natalie's mom loves me.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.880]   Just like your mom.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.440]   I'm a likable guy when it comes down to it.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.800]   My mom wants to have your baby.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   I'm honest.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.880]   A little late for that.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   I think you're more likely to die in a dryer fire than you are to get cancer from Wi-Fi.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.920]   But that's just my.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   There you go.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   Call back.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   Moving on.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.400]   Curved television sets.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.040]   As long as we're talking about CES, they're really, you know CES.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.400]   Frankly, if you ask me the biggest story is yes in the last eight years has always been
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.920]   televisions, right?
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.320]   But not always successfully.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   3D was the story.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   3D still around.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.400]   In 2008, remember the big story was mobile TV.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.280]   The little flow TV and things like that.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   Of course, Marcus was eight years old.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   He doesn't remember this, but this was the thing that everybody would have a TV in their
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   pocket.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   Mm hmm.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.760]   Nobody bought a TV in your pocket.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   Then it was 3D TV again.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   And that's success.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.760]   In fact, it's interesting.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.960]   Visio announced at CES this year.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   They're not going to make anymore 3D TVs.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   Why?
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   It only said five bucks circuit.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   It doesn't even cost anything extra to make them anymore.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   Yes.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   People didn't want them.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   Well.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.600]   But what we did see is a lot of UHD/4K.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.040]   They're not quite an interchangeable term.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.080]   So I'll use UHD, which is the industry term, ultra high def televisions.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   They're cheap too.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.080]   And they're very cheap.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.560]   And there's so many sub thousand dollars.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.880]   I'm surprised that you haven't swapped all the TVs.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.280]   You got monitors all over the place.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.960]   People don't realize that until they come in here.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.160]   Marcus, did you look at the 4Ks?
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   I do.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   I have one right behind me.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   I have another one.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   He's way ahead of you.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   Is that a sakey?
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   Which one do you have?
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.520]   Is this a sakey 39-inch?
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.040]   That's under a thousand dollars.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.280]   It's been under 600 for a while.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   It's really...
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   There you go.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.400]   Do you watch anything on that?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.320]   That one no, because right after I got that, Black Friday happened.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.960]   And a TCL 50-inch went down to $7.99.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960]   Wow.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   I bought that.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   Wow.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.560]   So that's just a prop behind you.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.520]   Until I find out, yeah, I'm going to review it, which means putting it right here and connecting
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.840]   the Mac Pro to it tonight, maybe.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.440]   But yeah, right now, there was a ton of 4K TVs at CES.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.520]   I made a video about actually the 4K cameras of CES, because there were a lot less of those
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.640]   and they were a little more interesting than me.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.040]   But yeah, everyone had a 4K TV.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   What was your name?
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   Tell us about those.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.840]   Yeah, the 4K cameras.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.480]   So the Galaxy Note 3 shoots 4K, or I should say UH...
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   No.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   No 4K.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   No, this shoots 4K.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.360]   It's full, full frame rate.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.520]   It's very watchable.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.440]   It's just not the highest bit rate, and it tends to fall apart with any sort of movement.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.640]   But I talked about the fact that that is a 4K sensor, and you can record 4K video.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:17.400]   So Sony came out with their new Handicam, which is a $2,000 coming soon 4K Handicam
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.200]   that you're basically holding your hand and can shoot 4K with video with and really high
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   quality.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   They're pretty good at that.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.040]   They had a couple of other 4K cameras.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.160]   There was some 4K at the Canon booth.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.600]   Nothing really new or cheap.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.240]   They had the 1DC, which is $12,000 and the C500, which is $25,000.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   So the whole point of the video was that CES is showing things that are expensive now
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.160]   that will eventually, with volume, hopefully become much cheaper and more available this
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.320]   year.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.600]   So with all the 4K TVs, you might as well have a camera that shoots 4K, so you can enjoy
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   that to the fullest.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   So...
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.720]   I'm shooting 4K right now on my Galaxy Note 3.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720]   Right now.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   Look at that.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.960]   Now, admittedly, it doesn't have a great lens or anything, but it's actually fairly credible
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.600]   for 4K full frame.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   It looks...
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   I've seen some really well-done...
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   This is your newest phone.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   This is your phone.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   This is the phone du jour.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   Phone du jour than this is...
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   I like this, by the way.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.440]   It's a little strange, I know.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.040]   Yeah, I think that's a good point, Marcus.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   This is like a laptop.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   It's the point.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.280]   It's the size of this thing.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.480]   You know, who needs a tablet?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.320]   You've got a phone and a tablet.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.760]   It's got all that Samsung crap on it.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.400]   There's the only thing wrong with it.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.080]   But it wouldn't make sense to do a Google edition because you've got the stylus.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   You have a lot of...
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.440]   Is this the one with the Samsung operating system?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   No, no, no.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   It's not Tizen.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   It's Android.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   Yeah, the Mike Tyson...
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.760]   Mike Tyson operating system.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.360]   It has a list, but it's powerful.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   There you go.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   In fact, Marcus, you're showing off the Note 3 right here on your YouTube video as I watch.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.200]   Did you shoot any of the video from the show on that?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   No.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.800]   I shot everything on the C100.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   I'll probably...
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:02.600]   I'm thinking this is the year I'm going to buy a 4K camera that I shoot my videos with
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.440]   as 4K becomes more and more UHD video, I guess.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.760]   But so far, yeah, I shot everything on this guy.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.440]   You can distribute on YouTube and 4K, but it's so compressed.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.200]   I don't know the point, right?
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   Yeah, the bit...
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   It doesn't...
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   I mean, you can actually tell when a video is shot in 4K when you're watching in 1080p.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   And I think that's...
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.400]   Because the bit rate is actually higher, but not a lot of people actually even watch it
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.840]   in 1080p or even 4K.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   So...
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.080]   Curve TVs, what do you think?
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.240]   I think it's the 3D of 2014.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.800]   I have a Curve TV.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   You do?
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   You got one?
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.720]   No, I have the Samsung OLED that they came out with earlier.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   It's curved.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   It's curved.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   It's about a 5% curve.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.360]   The only thing, as far as I could tell, the only thing about it, you can't hang it on
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.480]   the wall because it rolls back and forth.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.120]   You don't want to be sitting on the side because it's curved.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.000]   So it's dumb.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.840]   They did it because they could.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.040]   Did you see any advantage markets?
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.320]   Did it feel more immersive?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   Not really.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.960]   In the 105-inch one, you could have been to 105 inches.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.000]   So it would have felt more immersive anyway.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But I feel like it's another one of those things they did for the press, and oops, so
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   did everyone else.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.920]   But they had one that you could actually press a button and would mechanically go from flat
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.640]   to curved and then press it again and go back.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.400]   You should say the mechanical one.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.280]   Get some remote control.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Your friends through them and go, "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:49.800]   That's just butt is that.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:33:05.080]   There is some sort of advantage.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.760]   I guess what they were trying to tell was that if you're sitting in line with the center
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.640]   of the TV, sitting a good distance away from it, the wrapping of the sides would help to
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.080]   feel more immersive.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   I don't even know what they mean by that word, but it looked okay from the center.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:28.040]   But once you get off-axis from whatever distance you are, parts of the image that are curved
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.120]   will appear a bit distorted, which could be good or bad.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   You're watching football.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.280]   It's going to look like the guy just got twice as big when he runs the side of the TV.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.800]   But if you're watching a movie, maybe you won't notice.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   I don't know.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.040]   It depends on the content, but I don't like distortion in the first place, so I wasn't
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.880]   a big fan.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.640]   That's also why I didn't like 3D.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   As you pointed out, John, Netflix got the most at mileage out of the UHD 4K story by
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   saying.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   They didn't have a booth.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   They didn't need a booth.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   No, they did very well for the system.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.000]   They pointed out that House of Cards was shot in 4K, even though it wasn't streamed to
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.120]   4K for the first season, but will be starting Valentine's Day streamed in 4K.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:13.160]   The problem is the word streamed in 4K.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.560]   How much bandwidth do you need for a 4K?
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   For quality for the system.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.760]   I like to, whatever so often I meet with the guy who I've met with him once, the Roku
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   CEO.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.320]   That's the first thing I always ask is, what does it take to get the best stream?
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.440]   What's the bit rate and all the rest of it?
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.080]   And now I have to go have lunch with him again to find out the absolute perfect numbers
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.400]   for streaming 4K.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   He used to be in Netflix.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.120]   Roku was a Netflix responder.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.800]   He actually, it was an interesting story of how he started.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.280]   So let me tell you what Netflix says about HD, and we can assume it, UHD will use roughly
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.760]   twice as much.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.720]   It's 2.8 gigabytes per hour if you're watching HD.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:59.880]   So you're going to say 5 or more gigabytes per hour of, now first of all, if you've got
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.360]   250 gigabyte caps, you probably shouldn't be doing more than a few movies a month.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.240]   One second, because you're talking 10 gigabytes of movie.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.160]   Second, I don't know anybody who has bandwidth like that.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.360]   That would be 5 because 3D would be this.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.880]   3D is 4.7 gigs.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   And 3D is 24K.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   Right.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   Because it has two frames.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.840]   So what is 5 gigabytes per hour in gigabytes per second?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.200]   About 12 to 13 megabits per second.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.760]   Is it that high?
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   Is that right?
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.320]   That seems shy.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   Times eight.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.800]   Marcus, you're young.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Can you do the math words?
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.560]   Yeah, I do do the math while we sit here and vegetate.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.760]   It's 15.6 megabits.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   Okay.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   So who has 15?
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.760]   That doesn't sound right either.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.040]   15.6, you may say, oh, I have Comcast first.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.280]   That's 20 megabits.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.280]   It's not sustained.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:53.320]   In fact, very few people can really do a sustained 15 megabits, Google fiber maybe.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.720]   So it's not a practical solution.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.960]   I don't know why Netflix is getting so much coverage for so few people can see it.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.520]   Sony also said we'll be streaming for it.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.440]   I do not believe that number, by the way.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.280]   I'm sure it's lower than that.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.600]   I'm thinking it's more around the...
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   It's a different number.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   It's a different number.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   It's a different number.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   It's a different number.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.280]   I'm guessing you could...
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.480]   I'll find out from somebody who knows what they're talking about who actually is practical
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   information.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   According to Gigo, I bet you...
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.040]   Yeah, Gigo, they did a calculation.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040]   That's all they did.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.640]   I think it's about five.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   Really that low?
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.440]   If it's that low, that's good.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.200]   Although if you look at the ISP report from Netflix, very few people can give you sustained
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   five five of its...
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   Five five of its...
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   Yeah, stuff.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:43.920]   We're taking a break, we're talking with Marcus Brownlee of MKBHD, the YouTube channel that
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   is second only to PewDiePie in fan love.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.480]   You got it.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.320]   Tell me Marcus, do you look at PewDiePie and go, "Why didn't I think of swearing while
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.560]   watching video games?"
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.280]   Well, why didn't I think of that?
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.040]   I don't play as many games, so I don't even...
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.880]   There's tons of only gaming YouTube channels out there.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.360]   I get a ton of viewers, and that's cool, but I don't watch any of the way...
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   This is why Marcus is so productive.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.640]   That's probably part of it.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   I don't watch much TV.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   It's totally good.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   So people always ask...
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.120]   I think PewDiePie just broke a record.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.720]   He's the number one most subscribed YouTube channel.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.680]   Didn't they just go over whatever it was, 15...
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.640]   20 million subscribers.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   Holy cow.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.440]   That's a lot of people.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   They're all...
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.040]   By the way, Marcus, I just want to tell you they're all 10.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.920]   Because I know, because I have an 11 year old in the house, that's all he watches, PewDiePie,
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.840]   and he chortles.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   He chortles?
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.280]   He actually, what it is, is...
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   He goes...
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   That's a word.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.440]   Was he an old British man?
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.880]   No.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.040]   He watches PewDiePie, PewDiePie says a bad word.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   He goes...
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.760]   He chortles.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.040]   What is it, Tech Mommy?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   What is it that you do?
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   What's that called?
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.600]   Yeah, I'm not doing so much on Crash Test Mom these days.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   You're not?
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.520]   Not quite as active as I once was, but I'm going back to NBC, actually.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   What?
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   I've been working...
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   I've been doing...
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   I'm a contributor at NBC and CNBC.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   And also, I'm the tech contributor, the one and only for the Queen Latifah Show as well.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.280]   I know you watch that.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   That is exciting.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   Would you please?
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   That is.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.880]   That's actually one of the fanciest things I did.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.080]   She's awesome.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.360]   You call her the queen?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.480]   I try not to refer to her at all because she hasn't invited me to call her Dana, and
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   she refers to herself as that in conversation.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   Yes.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   But I don't know if to just call her queen, so I just don't say her name whole-lot.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   It's kind of like royalty.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.320]   Like real royalty and stuff.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.280]   Queen, by the way, good news, just renewed for a second season.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   Congratulations.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   I love her.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   I do too, actually.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.800]   So you're the official...
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.000]   She's one of the only people that I've been starstruck to meet her, and actually...
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Well, Joe Biden...
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Joe Biden, the guy has never made a right decision in the entire career.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Oh, shut up!
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Oh, and don't start.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.360]   That was a very exciting time for me.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   I'm in my White House getting a case.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   You were at the White House.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   Tell us about that.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   That was recent.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.880]   Yes, Skype, and being sponsored a series of discussion questions with politicians called
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   Ask the White House.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.760]   So I was asked to moderate the discussion, and people sent in their questions over Skype.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.360]   And the panel was about immigration.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.080]   The goal is that they'll do more about different topics, but it was with Cecilia Munoz, who's
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.960]   the director of public policy.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.000]   And the vice president got word of it, and he was like, "I want to participate, too."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.720]   Because they're really pushing their immigration bill, and so he asked to sit in.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.080]   I had never done any work at the White House before.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.480]   That was really exciting for me.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   So if you want to see it, you can go to Skype.com/whithouse.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   Ask the vice president.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   I always wanted to just say, "I've never done any work at the White House, so this was
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   a real high for me."
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   I know, look at me looking at all the people there.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.040]   I'm really proud of that.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   No, tell me about this room that you're in.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.920]   What is the story with this room?
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:26.160]   That is in the executive offices of the White House, and it used to be the office of...
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.440]   Oh, I'm going to blink.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:34.280]   It's the Secretary of Defense, which used to be the Secretary of War.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   And it's not...
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.680]   Oh, going back to the Roosevelt administration.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   No, it goes back to the Civil War, actually.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   But he was the Secretary of War.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.840]   It wasn't even in Roosevelt, I think.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.520]   I think it was the last of it.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.880]   Yeah, he ran against Roosevelt.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   What's his name?
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   Come on, history.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.520]   More different people ran against Roosevelt.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.520]   Henry Stimson.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.520]   No.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   That was...
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   He was Secretary of State.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.520]   One of the most...
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520]   Time to look in the chat room, too.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   Come on, chat room.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   So...
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   I need it.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   There he is.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.120]   There's President Biden and his sign language interpreter.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   That's exciting.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   Who is she?
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   Is that that black guy who just makes it up?
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   Who is she?
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   Who is this woman?
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   I just told you who she is.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.520]   Her name is Cecilia Munoz.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   She was the Secretary of War.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   She was the Secretary of Justice.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   Here you go.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.800]   Castro, there's the chat room.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Very good.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   It's tapped.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   William Howard tapped?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   Tapped, yes.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   Oh.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   I knew my husband went down.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Didn't really...
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   Did Clayton come running in and says...
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   Well, that was William Howard tapped.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   He was Secretary of State.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   I don't remember.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.440]   He was a Tapped running against Roosevelt.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   Clayton has a...
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.880]   He has a minor in history.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.760]   And so, he reads history books for fun.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.760]   So I knew he would...
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   He's in the other room watching.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   He's watching the football game as well.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   You know what I mean.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   You know what I mean.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   I have four messages.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.000]   Tapped, tapped, tapped.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.640]   When did Tapped run against Roosevelt?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.400]   Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   It's all history.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   That's what matters.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.240]   It's the history of the world.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.400]   Because he ran against Hoover, then he ran against Wanda Wilke.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400]   You look so good.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   He ran against Smith.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   In this, Natalie.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   This is so cool.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.400]   Thank you.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.640]   Did he offer to put his arm around you and get a selfie?
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   No.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   Okay.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.920]   And that was the same morning that that story broke.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   Which one?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.560]   The selfie or him putting the arm around the lady with the...
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   The Nelson Mandela funeral.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.920]   That story broke that morning when I was in Washington.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.720]   So it felt like kind of a buzzy day.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.080]   So is this William Howard Taff's office?
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   It was.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.800]   He was so fat he had a special chair made.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   He's a big fat guy.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Big fat guy.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.960]   In fact, I remember seeing his bathtub.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.320]   It was like extra large.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   You saw his bathtub?
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   I don't know where.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   How does that work?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   You know, this...
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   You got...
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   You know, it's been...
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   I wasn't...
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.320]   It might take a shower.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.520]   It's back when I worked in the White House.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.320]   You know, the guy was so fat he had his own zip code.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.960]   No, you could do better than that.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   That's an old...
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   I stole it.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   You could do better than that.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   There he is.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.200]   Secretary of War William Howard Taffed.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.400]   In fact, he initiated the second occupation of Cuba.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.840]   So those of you who said Fielele Castro.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   I'm ever close.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   I understand the confusion.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.000]   No, the task was Roosevelt's Secretary of War.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.720]   And then ran against him.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.120]   He was president, of course.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   Briefly.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.520]   Roosevelt, not Roosevelt.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.000]   There's the bathtub, by the way.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.080]   Oh, the old Roosevelt.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   The original Roosevelt.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.320]   That's the bathtub.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   Where is that?
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   Because I have seen that.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   It is Taffed's bathtub.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   There's just like a bathtub.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.320]   It doesn't look anything special.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   It's extra...
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.320]   For those days, this was the...
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   You know, this turn of the century.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   They didn't have a big tub.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.240]   But his portliness goes forward, not out.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.520]   So you don't need a big bathtub for the time.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.000]   Take a shower, my friend.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   That's what I always say.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   The port...
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.120]   There, see, you get four people in that bathtub.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120]   Ah.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   There's a small boat.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   Revidub Dubb, Secretary of War.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   He had a drunk award in a tub.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   We're going to take a break.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   About time.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   That was the best innovation of that, your CES.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.120]   Winner of the year's...
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   Yes, innovation award for 1904.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   Got it.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   You're right.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   Booms, Roosevelt was running in the Booms.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   Booms, he ran against him.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   It's an independent...
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.120]   The original Roosevelt.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.120]   I'm just thinking of Frank...
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.120]   No, we're not thinking of Frankly.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.120]   Sorry about that.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   That's why it's Roosevelt, not Roosevelt.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   Teddy was Roosevelt.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   Did you know that?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   No, actually, I did not know that.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   Teddy was a Roosevelt.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   Let's have Frankly.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   Let's have Frankly.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   Let's have Frankly.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   Let's have Frankly.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Clayton knows.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   Clayton knows.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   He's listening.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, I show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   It's not a law firm.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   It's better.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   It lets you get the legal stuff you need to do done without paying for a high priced attorney.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   It's personalized, affordable legal protection.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   Now, I'm thinking we've got some enterprising people here on the show today.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   Many of you are watching.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.120]   I highly recommend starting your own business.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.120]   It's the best thing I ever did.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   A lot of fun.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.120]   Of course, the first thing I did, I asked my friend Kevin Rose.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   I went to Kevin who started many a business.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   I said, "Where do I..."
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.120]   He said, "Go to LegalZoom.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   Get an LLC.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   99 bucks."
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.120]   I said, "Okay.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   Thank you."
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   You can also get a corporation, Chapter S or Chapter C Corporation.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   I also got Twit Trademarked, the logo in the name, for 169 bucks.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   You can get personal stuff too, Last Will and Testament.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.120]   Now, here's something new.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   This is something recently added.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   You can get connected with a third party attorney.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:31.120]   The LegalZoom Legal Plan pre-negotiates for a flat feed advice from attorney in your state.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   And you can choose that attorney based not only on their profile, but unedited reviews from LegalZoom customers.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.120]   This is a great, great thing to know about.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   If you're starting your own business, if you want to protect your family, protect yourself over a million entrepreneurs have done just as I did.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   And go to LegalZoom.com to get their business started.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.120]   90% of LegalZoom customers recommend LegalZoom to family and friends.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.120]   That's a very high number.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   Very good deal.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   No surprise fees, no hassles, no headaches.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   Go to LegalZoom.com.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   Use our discount code Twit.

[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.120]   Really is a great place.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   Good to know about when you start your business.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.120]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   Marcus, have you incorporated or are you an LLC or?
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   Maybe this year, not yet.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   Yeah, I think it's time.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   I think it's time.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.120]   You've obviously got an empire going here.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   Yeah, that's probably a trade market.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.120]   MKBHD.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   If for no other reason, I learned this the hard way that since I'm a freelancer too, if you incorporate,
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   then it's easier to get a loan if you want to buy a house or something because otherwise
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.120]   you need three years stated income for a certain, you know, whatever.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   But now interest rates seem to be changing so fast in the year 2014.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.120]   So anyone who might want to get any kind of loan should incorporate because it's easier
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   to prove when you've got an LLC.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:04.120]   Did you know that this week is the seventh anniversary of the iPhone?
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.120]   Of the iPhone announcement at Macworld.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   I remember going to see this at the Moscone Center West.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   Steve Jobs, it was such an amazing moment.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   I want to go back a little bit and play for you seven years ago.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   How old were you?
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   You were 13, Marcus.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   Did you?
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.120]   Seven.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   Were you paying attention to this kind of stuff then?
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.120]   I remember that.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   I remember the day that a reporter was interviewing a guy who just got his iPhone stolen during
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   the original iPhone.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   I was actually, remember, someone getting one in one of my classes and bringing it into
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   school, which was a terrible idea.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   I remember that.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   But he was the star that day.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   Actually, let me play a little bit of this because this was an amazing moment.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.120]   It's a wide screen iPod with touch.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   I remember this.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:02.120]   This is probably, I would say this is arguably the greatest moment in product keynote history.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.120]   This is Steve Jobs at his absolute peak.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   Three revolutionary products of this class.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   Everybody in the room knows we're there probably for an iPhone announcement.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   Nobody knew exactly what, but we didn't know what it was going to be called.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   Is this the time you were filming it?
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   No, no, no.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   This is before that.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.120]   I was sitting next to Scott Born Merlin, man Alex Lindsey.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   We had just gotten a macro.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.120]   We were sitting in this keynote.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   And there's a really palpable excitement because everybody's wondering what is Apple going
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   to do in this space?
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   Is a wide screen iPod touch control?
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   Three new products.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   People are excited about the iPod, a wide screen iPod.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   I don't know.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   Watch Steve because he's, he's, he's eating this.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   The second is a revolutionary multi-frame.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   Okay.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   Now the crowd's saying, what could that be?
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   Three of them are excited.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   The miles of flies here like what?
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.120]   Like what does that mean?
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.120]   What?
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.120]   He needed three things.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   A wide screen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   Internet communications device.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   One more time.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   An iPod, a phone.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   Are you getting it?
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   It's still good, chill.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   These are not three separate devices.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   This is one device.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.120]   That's a fair part.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   Today, today Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.120]   You know what's like this?
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.120]   You remember this, Marcus.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   You really did.

[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   That was my favorite part.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   For a second I was like, what?
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   What?
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   Actually here it is.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   Some people lip sync in their bedroom.
