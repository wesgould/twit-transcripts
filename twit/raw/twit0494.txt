[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.760]   to talk about the latest stories.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.800]   I'll start all the way to my right,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.920]   you're left with the fabulous film girl, Christina Warren,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.440]   is here from Mashable.com.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   Great to see you.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.640]   Great to be here.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.560]   Yes, we love the film girl.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.840]   Also with us Harry McCrack and the technologizer.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   Now at Fast Company.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.560]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.720]   Keeping Fast Company.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.280]   And Harry was in Redmond for the Microsoft announcement.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520]   So we're going to get some hands on with a whole little lens.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.240]   Also with us, my good friend Steve Kovac,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.480]   his second appearance on Twit.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.200]   And he's out there in polar vortex land.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.160]   It's not quite yet.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.080]   Soon.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.840]   Isn't this a slider?
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.000]   Actually both you and Christina are getting ready
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.200]   for two feet of snow in New York.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.520]   And can I have a kitten long island?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.240]   Wow.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.840]   Do you do anything special for that?
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.920]   Whole lot.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.880]   Get a lot of food.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.400]   Get food.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.120]   Alcohol.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.640]   Get food.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.400]   Drink.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.000]   Drink.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   Is it-- do you feel like you'll be stuck inside
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.600]   with no power for days?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.080]   No power, but the trains are going to be totally screwed up,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.560]   I'm sure.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.840]   So I'm going to have to work from home.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.520]   Hopefully my internet connection lasts.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.200]   Does it usually?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.760]   It held up during Sandy during the hurricane.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.680]   Wow.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.840]   And you're in Manhattan.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.560]   You're in the city.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.400]   Wow.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   Yeah, I was lucky.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.600]   I guess the big story has to be Microsoft.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.120]   On Wednesday, they had an event which they had invited
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.160]   a small number of tech journalists, too,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.520]   including our own Paul Thorett and Mary Jofoli.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.560]   And of course, Harry McCracken was there.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.240]   You look comfy.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   You had sofas.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.040]   And yeah, in terms of comfort for an event you live blog,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.280]   it was like very high end.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080]   There were sofas and couches.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.800]   And were you live blogging from your iPad?
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.120]   Well, I was like most of the other people in that room.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.600]   I was using a MacBook Pro.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.960]   This is the thing that cracked me up.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.320]   Paul and Mary Jo did note this.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.560]   There were very few windows machines in Evans.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.160]   And I have a surface pro, which I like.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.760]   But I didn't know whether I'd have a table or a lap
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.640]   or whether I'd be all crunched up.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.840]   And I was a little concerned about using a two piece device
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.040]   that might fall apart.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   But it's lappable.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.360]   They say it's lappable.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.040]   It's about 85% as lappable as a laptop.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   But when you're live blogging, you
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.880]   want to remove every possibility of error.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   And we knew that they would be talking about the consumer
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   version of Windows 10.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But Microsoft did come up with some pretty big surprises.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.200]   First of all, I had thought this was completely unlikely.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   There were rumors that had been going on for months
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.000]   that Microsoft might give it away.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.920]   And in fact, they are.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   Yeah, for the first year, if you have Windows 7 or above,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.360]   you can upgrade for free.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.120]   Or a Windows 8 phone.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.320]   Or that's right.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.080]   Which is pretty amazing.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.160]   In fact, this is going to be, for the first time,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.280]   one Windows for phone, for desktop, for tablet,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.920]   even for Xbox, Windows 10 everywhere.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.560]   And apps that can run on any device.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   And a single unified store, universal apps.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.400]   This is fascinating.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   The real thing, though, I surprised
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.960]   me, is isn't this Microsoft's bread and butter selling Windows?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.720]   Are they giving it to OEMs for free?
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.000]   Well, in some cases, they are because for the smaller phones
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.360]   and smaller tablets.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.600]   It's under eight inches.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's for right now.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   First, they're for free and I can't see any way they could ever
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   do that for PCs.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.000]   Microsoft doesn't say free, by the way.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.720]   For that, they say $0.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.400]   Which I don't just need a distinction.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.120]   It's an inter-- they did say the word FREE, though,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.880]   for Windows 10.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.840]   I think that's fascinating.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.200]   We should clarify, because it's not immediately obvious
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   when they say for one year.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   You're going to-- if you get it in that first year,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   it's yours.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.400]   It's done.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.520]   There's no subscription feed, or there's no additional fees.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.080]   You just have to do the job in the first year,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.000]   and then you're sat, and you qualify for support and everything.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And who knows?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   Maybe in the second year they'll keep doing it.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.520]   I doubt they'll stop.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.920]   But it's obvious that their real goal
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.680]   is to get people move to the new version as soon as possible.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.120]   Why?
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480]   What's the hurry?
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.560]   No one upgraded to eight.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.760]   Oh, that.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.720]   That must have been around seven still.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   Exactly.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.760]   And so they need to get that for free.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.080]   Almost half of all Windows users are on XP.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.000]   I mean, it's been almost a decade and a half since it was
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.200]   kind of normal that you assume that if you used Windows,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.600]   you would upgrade to the next version,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.760]   because that's when XP came out.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   And there was that long period when so many people were stuck
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.320]   on XP, which isn't entirely over yet.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.040]   No, I get calls every day on the radio show from people
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   who are using Windows XP.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.880]   I did today.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.160]   It's not a given that people want to upgrade their operating
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   system anymore.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.160]   In the past, the way you got an upgrade on Windows
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.480]   pretty much always was you got a new computer.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.200]   Very--
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   That's not true.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.920]   --unlike Apple, where Apple users will upgrade every time
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.600]   there's a new upgrade.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.240]   They'll take their existing machine.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   They'll download it and install it.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.080]   Whether it's free or not, Apple's free now.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.680]   But even when they charge $30, pretty much everybody just
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.240]   did it.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.480]   But Windows users were always slowed up.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   They just basically said, well, then when I get a new
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.240]   computer, I'll get the new version.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.680]   Which is part of why Microsoft can do this, because the
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   upgrade business for Windows is still relatively small,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.800]   compared to putting it on your system.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.640]   So that's, I guess, what I'm asking.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.840]   So it sounds like Dell is going to still pay Microsoft when
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   you buy a new Dell with Windows 10.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.040]   They're still going to get some money.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.720]   They will presumably still be paying a fairly large chunk
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   of change.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   You can-- they put it online yesterday, download the
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   latest technical preview.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.960]   They're still calling it a technical preview.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.360]   But this is the consumer version.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.520]   I don't understand what's going on.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.160]   It's still called the technical preview.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.600]   And they're still a bunch of features.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.440]   It's more of a consumer feature.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.880]   Rolled out, yeah.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.160]   What do you guys think of the UI?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.400]   I mean, I think in many ways, Microsoft is responding to
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.360]   people who hated Windows 8 and 8.1.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.560]   They got rid of the charms power.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   They realized they screwed up.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.480]   And Windows 8 was for the normal people out there.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.760]   It's just a disaster.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   You couldn't use it.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   I mean, I remember one time shortly after it launched, going
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   to Best Buy and seeing a woman just completely confused at
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.960]   the Geek Squad bench.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.200]   And I made a big joke about that at the time.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   But it's true.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.000]   It was great for people like you and me who can noodle
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.880]   around and were tech-y and so forth.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.440]   But the normal people were scared of it.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.760]   And this is a step back and much more familiar interface
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   this time. And I think it's the right move.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.360]   I think it's the right move, making it free.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   It's going to be a massive upgrade cycle.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.120]   So many people still seeing XP, a lot of small businesses
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.640]   still on XP.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.960]   This is going to be a huge upgrade cycle for them.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.600]   Isn't that kind of critical for Microsoft?
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.960]   They get business to move.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   Business has been slow to adopt.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.360]   I think that that's really honestly why they're doing the
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.800]   free year is that they have so many businesses that they
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   haven't really been able to necessarily move to the
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.800]   latest office versions.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   And they're going to have the next version of Office 365.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.320]   They're going to want to push people towards that,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.360]   towards a yearly recurring license rather than a one-off.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.320]   And I think if they can get businesses who might be on
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.640]   XP or might be on 7 and really had no interest in going to 8
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   at all to say, OK, for the first year, you can upgrade for
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.160]   free.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.120]   They might be able to take the bite out of that and convince
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.000]   people who might not otherwise be making hardware
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.520]   purchases.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   So that's probably why the OEMs are willing to go along with
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.800]   this because they can say, hey, we can go ahead and sell you
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.920]   these new systems or do something for you to get you an
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.640]   upgrade.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.440]   And yeah, they need to get business back because
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.720]   consumers are increasingly, I think, they're going to be
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   Microsoft's losing them anyway.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.400]   But they really can't afford to lose business.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.280]   And unfortunately, the 8 and 8.1 cycle was just to complete
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.120]   in total turnoff for any business to adopt because why
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.960]   would you want to bother?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.480]   It's fine on a touch interface, but if you're using it with
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.040]   the mouse and keyboard primarily, it really doesn't work well.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   And that, I think, has been the biggest advantage that Windows
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.560]   10 has is that it finally works really well with the
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.320]   mouse and keyboard, which is how most people in a business
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.120]   environment are going to be using it.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.040]   I have to say, not only you've sought off the rough edges,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.560]   they got rid of the charms bar, which was weird.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.360]   But you do have a notification center that swipes in from
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:55.600]   the right.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   That looks very much like, actually, yeah, very much like
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.320]   the Apple Notification Center.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.040]   Swiping in from the same location, although you can add
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.480]   action icons at the bottom.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.160]   And you can have an arbitrary number of them.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.320]   It looks like you can just add new actions.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.680]   So it's very customizable.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.560]   I really like that.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.640]   You've got a start menu.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   Yes, there are tiles in the start menu, but it's much more
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   like the Windows 7.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.560]   It has Cartana, which is potentially pretty significant.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.320]   That's a huge one.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.080]   Now, if you use Chrome on almost any system right now, you
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   can talk to Chrome, right?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.920]   You can say, OK, Google and Chrome will respond.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.960]   But this is system-wide.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.040]   And you saw the demo.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.000]   Did you guys play with Cartana at all?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.520]   I haven't tried the new version yet.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.120]   So I've used Cartana on Windows Phone.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   It's like Siri or Google now.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.800]   It does many of the same things, different in some ways.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.560]   I mean, Microsoft plays up the notion that it's more
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.000]   respectful of your privacy, because they have this notebook
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   that shows you exactly what Cartana knows about you.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.920]   And if there's stuff you don't want Cartana to know, you
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.040]   can switch it off.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.280]   I think that's one you can make.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.960]   For the customized Cartana in there
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   and tell her your interest.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   In fact, it's kind of more like a Google now than a Siri.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.160]   If you open Cartana on Windows Phone, you'll actually
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.720]   get a Google-style stack of information, news stories,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.760]   and so forth.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.120]   This is--
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.640]   It's kind of a hybrid between the two, right?
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.720]   I mean, it has the personal assistance features.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.680]   But yeah, I think the big stuff they really target is really
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.800]   the Google Now type of stuff.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.520]   But as Harry says, it's a little bit more
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.000]   respectful, potentially, of your privacy.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.960]   They vary early on at the keynote on Wednesday
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.760]   and they said, you're not a Microsoft, you're not the product.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.840]   Clearly a shot to Google and Facebook.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.200]   Yeah, they swiped that from Apple, too.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.520]   Tim Cook said the same thing last summer
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.720]   after that whole iCloud gate hacking scandal.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.080]   They came out with that big thing.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.720]   And he basically said the same thing.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.600]   And it's a big jab at Google and Facebook.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.960]   So they totally borrowed that line from Tim Cook.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.680]   I think it's smart.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.160]   I think Apple and Microsoft are responding to what consumers
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.760]   have said.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.720]   We are concerned about privacy.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.080]   And if Apple and Microsoft could say,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.760]   well, we offer an alternative to Google
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.520]   that protects your privacy, that's probably a good way to sell.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.640]   In a way, Microsoft has a head start here.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   The problem with Apple doing a Google Now style thing
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.400]   is they don't know enough about you.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.880]   But Microsoft, because of Bing, now you kind of understand
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.840]   why they've been sinking hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   a year into their online services,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.080]   they have been collecting that kind of information.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.640]   But do you think it's credible that Microsoft and Apple
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.280]   really do protect your information?
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.920]   And I'm not talking about advertisers here,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.880]   but I'm talking about the one we really worry about
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.680]   from the NSA.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.920]   Do they do a better job?
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.520]   Is that credible?
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.320]   It's really unclear.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.880]   And Microsoft did have that issue.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.320]   Was it last year or the year before,
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   where there was somebody who was sending out their proprietary
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.600]   code and they wanted to see who was doing that.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.680]   And they went into their Microsoft email account.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.920]   That was helpful.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.480]   And they later said, we shouldn't have done that.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.960]   And they said we're going to have an ombudsman in the future
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.040]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.120]   But really, if the NSA comes a call to any American corporation,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.400]   especially if they come with what's
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.960]   called a national security letter, which can assert,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   we want every bit of information.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.920]   And you are required by federal law
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.640]   not to reveal that we've asked for it even.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.040]   Microsoft's not going to say no.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.760]   Well, the whole industry is pushing back way more
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.000]   than they ever did before.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   The Snowden revelations.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.160]   And that's the--
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   Do they have?
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.280]   --the Japple and Microsoft?
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.520]   I wonder how much of that pushback is for show
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.120]   and how much of it's real.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.280]   Well, I do believe they put it.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.920]   There are a lot of scrutiny.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.480]   And there has to be a very high bar
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.440]   that they have to pass when the government comes to them
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.480]   with these kind of requests.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.600]   But I think what they need to be doing,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.560]   and Twitter is advocating this, I know,
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.880]   is right now they can only give a range of requests
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.360]   that they get, like 0 to 200 or something, 2 to 1.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.480]   And what they're trying to do now is Twitter
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.680]   and some other of these companies,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.480]   they're trying to say, we want to say exactly how many,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.400]   because then we'll get a real look,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.240]   because you look at--
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.840]   They're not even allowed to say
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.680]   how many government requests they've gotten.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.200]   I mean--
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.120]   They can only give the range.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.480]   They can say somewhere between 0 and 1,000.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.400]   That's how constrained they are.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.720]   It strikes me that any-- there's no high bar.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.640]   All they need to get is a letter from a FISA judge
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.840]   saying, give us the stuff.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.760]   And that's it.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.920]   There's no high bar.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.640]   Any impression that there's a high bar
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.120]   is completely window-dressing.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.560]   Christina--
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.440]   There's a bar if they show it or not.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.280]   If they actually give that information over,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.720]   that's the bar they look at.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.400]   They can still say no to the government.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   No, they can't.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.800]   What do you not?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.600]   No, they can get the request.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.280]   No, but they don't turn everything over
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.120]   that they get the request.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.080]   Sure they do.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.480]   Oh.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.760]   What makes you think they don't?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.680]   You think they turn over every single request?
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.000]   If it's an NSL, they do.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.840]   No.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.600]   They say no.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   We prefer not.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.360]   Let's go argue this in the super-secret FISA court.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.000]   Christina, what do you think?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.960]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.520]   I think that Microsoft is in a precarious position.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   Go ahead, Steve.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.000]   I think Microsoft's in a precarious situation,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.040]   more so than some of the other companies,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.080]   because they kind of have the two masters to serve, right?
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.200]   I mean, on the one hand, yeah, it is really hard
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.280]   to get an NSL letter and say a few.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.840]   On the other hand, Microsoft really
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.840]   needs to have the, at least, appearance
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.240]   that they're taking these things seriously
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.600]   and that they won't hand things over,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.520]   because so many of their customers are not
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.960]   consumers but businesses.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.320]   Well--
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   And so that opens up--
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.800]   Well, no.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.680]   And they have the big business outside the US.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.880]   Precisely, precisely.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   And so that makes it very different, I think,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.640]   than it does for a more consumer-oriented company,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   because they can't have--
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.640]   there can't be an appearance that they're
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.200]   going to turn their business users' information
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.440]   or their corporate users' information over to the government,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   whether they're in the US or out of it.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.600]   They just can't have that, that appearance.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.720]   And that's why I think the instance that Harry mentioned,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.760]   where they tracked down the person who
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.960]   was stealing their own code from inside their systems
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.640]   and went into the guy's Hotmail account,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.200]   that's why that was actually pretty disturbing,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.760]   because, yeah, they were technically allowed to do it.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.200]   But it's like we don't want to think about the fact
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.600]   that just because they can, that they will take advantage
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.280]   of those things.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.800]   And so it's a tricky-- it's a slippery slope.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.560]   I would hope that they would be less forthcoming
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.360]   over certain things.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.120]   I would hope that they would push back as much as possible.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.080]   But that, I think, has been the biggest problem.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.200]   And that's why the Snowden documents and revelations
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.320]   continue to be so important.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.960]   It shines light on just how untransparent this entire process
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.200]   is and how much we don't know from so many different perspectives.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.360]   Well, and you remember the case, which was resolved in--
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.720]   during the summer, Microsoft was
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.440]   subpoenaed for information that was stored in Ireland.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.120]   And of course, that's quite a precedent,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.760]   because it's a US court saying you
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.600]   have to turn over information stored on servers overseas.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.680]   Microsoft did fight it, but I think they fought it.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.440]   So far, I think.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.920]   Yeah, but yeah.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.080]   But they're going to lose.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.480]   I mean, it's not.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   I guess they'll have to go to the Supreme Court,
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.960]   at which point they'll lose.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.720]   The last judgment was from the US District Court
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.200]   for the Southern District of New York, which did upheld the ruling.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.240]   Did uphold the ruling.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.080]   But my question goes back really to this positioning
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.800]   of Microsoft will protect your data where Google won't.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.880]   They've been at that for a while.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.760]   Is that real or is that marketing?
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.040]   I mean, they had the screw gold campaign, which I think--
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.720]   They dropped that.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   They seemed to have--
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.600]   OK.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.720]   Which was more about Google as evil and a little bit less
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.600]   about Microsoft as doing things that are in your favor.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.160]   And I feel like it's much better in Messer Jane
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.560]   if they spend less time complaining about Google
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.160]   and more time actually building stuff, which
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.560]   is appealing to your privacy, such as this Cortana feature
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:43.920]   that lets you turn specific pieces of information on and off.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.560]   I feel like these companies do know, though, an awful lot about you.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.640]   And there's two levels of privacy violations.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.440]   There's one which Google obviously indulges in as does Facebook
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.920]   to sell it to advertisers.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.560]   And it's kind of the deal you make.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.400]   You get a free-- I mean, those companies give you free services.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.840]   And in return for free services, you give them information,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.160]   which they then sell to advertisers.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.880]   There's the second issue, which I think is more scary.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.240]   Maybe it's just me, but of the government being
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.920]   able to get information about where
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.320]   you've been, what you did, who you talked to.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.760]   Admittedly, that's in the name of a fight against terrorism.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.920]   But it seems overarching.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.040]   It feels to me like US tech companies would like to appear
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.120]   like they're fighting.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.320]   But I don't feel that they can.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.720]   Well, right, because it's hard.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   The way you could do that would be to encrypt more of the information
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.920]   that you store to basically make it up.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.440]   That's the way to do it.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.960]   The problem with doing that-- I mean,
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.200]   in Google's-- to their credit has been pushing for a lot more
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.760]   encryption stuff, the problem with doing that
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.160]   is that if you cut too much of that off,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.440]   and that first thing you're talking about--
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.880]   And they don't get the information either.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   And that becomes the big problem.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   I think that is maybe the one area where
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.200]   a micro-sophpter or apple to a certain extent
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.720]   could kind of take the high ground.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.520]   If they could say, Apple does with iMessage,
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.920]   hey, we're not selling this to advertisers,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.520]   and we're encrypting this ourselves.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.680]   So even if people ask for it, the law enforcement
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.640]   agencies that want to get access to iMessage.apple
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.200]   is like, yeah, we can't help you.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.600]   It's encrypted.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.040]   I think that that's kind of where the balancing point comes
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.600]   into place.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.680]   It's just a matter of how much of that information
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.080]   can you maybe separate.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.720]   And that's what Google, I think, is really trying to do.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.200]   They're trying to figure out how much of this meta stuff
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.160]   can we separate, and then how much of this hard core--
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.960]   we consider really personal information.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.760]   Can we keep behind an encryption?
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.080]   And then that's kind of going to be there.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.240]   They're go to defense.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.200]   If someone's asking them for the keys,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   they can say, yeah, actually, we can't do anything,
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.760]   because it's on the client side and we're just as lost as you are.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.400]   But it does kind of open up that chasm between the two
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:45.960]   philosophies.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.680]   It's like, on the one hand, we protect your privacy.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.240]   On the other hand, we need to disrupt your privacy
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.000]   in order to make money.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.960]   Right.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.320]   Well, I'm excited about Windows 10.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.920]   I feel like somewhat Microsoft has got its mojo back.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.680]   By the way, the Windows Insider program allows anybody
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.800]   to download it.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.120]   If you Google Windows Insider program,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   you sign in with your Microsoft account,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.000]   and they are offering you the latest build of Windows 10,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.200]   you probably should install it on your production machine.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.800]   And all of those who have are using it.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.640]   It's pretty stable.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.160]   It's pretty stable.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.600]   It's a lot of the stuff they show
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.280]   does not going to be available on this preview.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.360]   It will come out over the next few months.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.280]   They say, join the Windows Insider program
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.360]   and be among the millions of PC experts and IT pros
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.960]   around the world who are helping shape Windows 10.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.360]   If, however, you think an ISO is some kind of yoga pose,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.640]   this program will not be right for you.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.160]   But they do give it to you as an ISO, not as an EXC,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.080]   which is so nice, thank God, because half the time they don't.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.720]   And if you're trying to install it in a virtual machine,
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   you're out of love.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.080]   They do actually let you download a dozen ISO.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.520]   Virtual box, VMware, all of them
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.440]   will handle that ISO very nicely and easily,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.720]   and it's the easiest way to do it.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.240]   And probably that's the best way, I would say,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   do it in a virtual machine.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.080]   You're not going to corrupt your--
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.200]   You can install it on your Mac?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.280]   Yeah, put it on your Mac.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:01.760]   So cool.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.080]   So actually, we have a copy, I think, floating around somewhere.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.840]   I have to borrow it and install it.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.320]   So Cortana, a new interface.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.960]   The desktop is back.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.600]   What else is new in a interest in Windows 10,
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.960]   the new notification thing?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.040]   New web browser.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.160]   Oh, Spartan, yeah.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.920]   Let's talk about Spartan project.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.800]   Then what are you interested in?
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.480]   I was interested in the phone aspect of it.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.000]   I mean, a lot of people are freaking out about it,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.200]   and they showed a lot of cool stuff.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.080]   But I really don't think it's going
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.160]   to solve the big problem, which is apps.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.360]   And they claim this unified--
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.160]   It might.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.480]   It might.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.320]   Well, they claim that.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.240]   But are you really going to see-- and they say, well, OK,
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   it's the same thing, apps run everywhere.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.560]   But are you going to really see Snapchat, for example,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.880]   start picking an app for a desktop or a tablet
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.160]   just so they can get it on the phone,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.000]   because they can plug in some user base?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.040]   I don't think so.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.480]   Mobile apps are still way different than they are in desktop.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   Yes, you're right.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.160]   I mean, the come on--
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.640]   I just--
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.120]   People who are already running for Windows desktop
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   will be benefiting because they'll write once,
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.720]   and it can run on Xbox and on phones and on tablets.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   But you're right.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.040]   If you're a mobile developer, there's not much incentive
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.480]   for you to go right for Windows 10.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.840]   Exactly.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.880]   It's not going to make Instagram start taking Windows
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.640]   10. Seriously, you look at Instagram's desktop product.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.040]   It's just a crappy website that you go and scan through your
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.720]   photos.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   It's going to be same like that with so many other mobile
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.280]   developers.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.600]   I just don't see them adopting it.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.720]   Even now, Instagram finally did come out for Windows Phone.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.760]   It's kind of like the last version of Instagram.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   It's not the most recent.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.480]   It's not the most beta.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.640]   Yeah, you're not really getting a full Instagram experience.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.600]   And the fact--
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.640]   I have my 1520, which I think is a great phone, the Lumia 1520.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's so big.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.080]   I like big phones.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   I like that phone.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.400]   Six inches is just right for me.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.320]   But you're a smaller person.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.880]   I'm a large man.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   I don't know how big you are, Christine.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.080]   I've never met you in--
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.160]   I guess I have.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.960]   Yeah, we have.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.440]   I'm like 5'4".
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.040]   OK, see, so you wouldn't want a phone that's bigger than
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.080]   your head?
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.560]   No.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:56.960]   No.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.440]   But me, it's just a small portion of my cheek structure.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.400]   It's just like this.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.280]   It's not bad.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.480]   Anyway, I love the 1520.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.440]   Great camera.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.600]   I love it that I'm going to be able to put Windows 10 on it
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.720]   this fall when it comes out.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.440]   And I think that's great for free.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.120]   And you just burst my bubble, Steve, because I was excited
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.240]   that maybe more apps would come along with pipe, but you're
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:17.480]   right.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.080]   If you're a mobile developer, nothing's changed.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.880]   Makes no sense.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.360]   And those are the apps people want.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.960]   And they're not going to be there.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.280]   That's what's missing.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.680]   Windows Phone is still in a tight spot, and it's just hard
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.640]   to figure out what Microsoft could do to get it out.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.680]   It's so good, though.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.400]   I have to say, it's elegant.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.680]   If it had the total number of apps that Android or iOS
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.000]   had, I think it would be a very credible contender.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.400]   Don't you?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.760]   Totally.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.600]   I agree.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.080]   I mean, yes.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.000]   It's certainly way better.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.280]   It makes me cry.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.600]   Well, not literally.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.720]   It is sad, because I think generally speaking in technology,
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.760]   when you make something good, it does well.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.960]   That doesn't seem to be true with smartphones.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.640]   Harry, you've been in this business long enough
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.680]   to know that that's absolutely not true.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.520]   I could think of 100 technologies that were better
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.160]   than what were you.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.320]   BOS.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.840]   I think about the same BOS.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.240]   I could think of so many things that were better,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.200]   but didn't have the marketing or whatever.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.800]   There have been tons of things that were technologically
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.120]   superior, but I think when you build something that's
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.600]   a better experience for a consumer, which I don't think BOS
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.480]   was, they tend to do well.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.960]   What it's called is.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   Arguably, yeah.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.000]   But there just may be only room for two major mobile
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.240]   operating systems.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.040]   It was too late.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.280]   It wasn't anything wrong with it.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.440]   It's just too late?
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   The best thing Google every day was
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.440]   to have a reasonably modern mobile operating system
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.960]   before Microsoft did.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   I think Microsoft should do what the new CEO of BlackBerry
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   is doing and ask for legislation.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   Oh my god.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   Did you see that?
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   Oh my god.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   That was so ridiculous.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.560]   It was the same thing I've ever heard in my life.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.320]   So way to stay relevant.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.240]   I roasted him this week in a post just because that was so
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   out of line.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.880]   John Chan is the new CEO of BlackBerry.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.840]   He's calling for app neutrality.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:00.480]   He says it's unfair that developers pick and choose
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.320]   which platform they develop for.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.680]   That they should be required to develop for BlackBerry.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   Because.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   Because.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   Because.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   Because.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   Spinach.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   You know.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   I don't know why because.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.840]   I mean I thought Mike L and the other one Jim used to.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.080]   They were funny.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.840]   They were funny but they would say idiotic things.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   You know they would just say dumb things or they would cry
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.080]   on the BBC and say get the camera out of my face.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.560]   But this.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.880]   This has to be the dumbest thing any BlackBerry CEO has ever said
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.080]   and that's a really really strong statement.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   It makes it.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   I'm like.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   I feel like.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   But it is.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720]   But can you imagine the Canadian company asking the US
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.400]   government to mandate that app developers make apps for their
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.520]   crappy platform that no one wants.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.240]   He wants to close the app gap.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.360]   He says he says neutrality must be mandated at the application
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   and content layer if we truly want a free open and non
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.840]   discriminatory internet.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.000]   And that is why I ask you members of the United States Congress
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.200]   to pass a law.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.920]   That everybody has to develop for BlackBerry.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.720]   He says we do it.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.880]   BBM does it.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   We develop for everybody.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.400]   I have to say windows.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.600]   I'm sure somebody at Microsoft saying gosh if we can only get
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.760]   Google to develop for Windows phone.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   We'd be.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.960]   Seriously and by the way of blackberry BBM for iOS is terrible.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   BBM for Android is terrible.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.280]   So maybe don't talk up your cross platform strategy when your
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.120]   apps still look like blackberry 10 versions of apps ported on the
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.560]   other operating system and barely work.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.400]   He's just he's just desperate.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   The poor guy you got it.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.520]   I mean I think it's possible that is goal is not for anybody to
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   take this seriously.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.800]   The goal was just to get attention.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.600]   Maybe is there a better way to get attention than remind people
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   that you still exist after the failed Samsung rumor by being
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.560]   like yeah and this is why this is why no one should buy you
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.360]   because you're saying saying things like this.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.280]   I mean seriously he made he made the guy that that failed at
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   buying for an NHL teams seem like the same blackberry CEO.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   It's nuts to me.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   It did remind me of one thing though which I think is a shame
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.840]   which is when Apple originally released FaceTime.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.400]   Steve Jobs explained that they were going to open the
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.840]   standard so it could be on every device and they never
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.320]   followed through with that.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   No.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.560]   And it would be a better world if they had Becky Wirley who was
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.480]   on Twitter at the time was at the Apple event where and she
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.920]   Steve Jobs is wandering through the demo booth and she's got her
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.240]   camera phone out.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.040]   Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs when are you going to make FaceTime open?
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.360]   She never got invited to another Apple event.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   He just moved.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.480]   No, not talking about that.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.280]   That was a great moment.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   Thank you Becky Wirley.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   All right we're going to take a break.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.480]   We're going to come back more from the Microsoft Windows 10
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   announcement.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.800]   They surprised everybody.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.840]   Sure Windows 10, Windows 10, Windows 10 and then oh by the
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.960]   way the new future of user interface.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.400]   How about this?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   It's really impressive we'll talk about HoloLens in just a
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   second.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.560]   I got a brand new sponsor for our show this week.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.280]   It's LD products, the ink and toner experts.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.120]   When you need high quality printer ink and toner cartridges,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   LD products, they do sell the manufacturers cartridges but
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.600]   better yet get the LD, the quality alternative, some products
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.920]   as much as 75% off OEM.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.160]   They've been in business for 15 years since 1999.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.360]   They're biz rate customer certified, a Google trusted
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.960]   store, 1 million orders a year and you could talk to a real
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.240]   person to figure out what kind of toner or ink you need.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.680]   The customer service department is so nice they talk to you
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.520]   like you're speaking to the CEO's mom.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.880]   I could help you with that.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.640]   Seven days a week from their US based call center, all their
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.480]   products risk free with a two year 100% customer satisfaction
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   guarantee.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.400]   So if you've been thinking maybe I should save, you know the
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   deal, the printer manufacturers give away the printer and then
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.440]   they get you on the ink.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.720]   If you want to save a little money, if you don't want to have
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.120]   to play that game, this is a great deal.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.160]   And if you're nervous at all with that 100% customer
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.040]   satisfaction guarantee for two years, you don't ever have to
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   worry.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.000]   Buying LD brand cartridges helps the environment.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.240]   It keeps oils, plastics, wastes out of our landfill.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.080]   They operate from a platinum LED, a lead certified building in
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.640]   Long Beach.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.200]   These guys really care about the environment.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.240]   A 110,000 square foot platinum lead certified building in
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.640]   Long Beach.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.440]   Wow.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.200]   That's where their call center, their warehouse and the
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.520]   headquarters are.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.640]   LD products, your printer needs are covered, remanufactured,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.360]   compatible, brand name products to get 10% off ink and toner
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.480]   plus free shipping, excluding OEM.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.320]   Go to LD products.com/twit and enter the offer code TWIT.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.680]   Find out what kind of cartridges you need.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   We've been using them.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.160]   We've been using this instead of the HP laser toner and very
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.040]   happy with it.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.880]   10% off LD products.com/twit.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.680]   Don't forget to use the offer code TWIT.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.800]   We thank them for their support.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.720]   So you got to.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.040]   I know when we were watching the press conference and they
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.800]   bring out the hollow lens, which look like a wrap around
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.120]   sunglasses all the way around your head.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.320]   At first, I thought, oh, yeah, yeah, this is so they get a
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.440]   lot of attention, it's like announcing the surface table.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.280]   This is because USA Today will lead with this, but this isn't
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.680]   a serious product.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.840]   But then as I'm watching and I'm talking to people like
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.920]   Paul and Mary Jo and Harry, who actually use it, what do
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.200]   you think?
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.560]   Well, a couple of disclaimers, one of which is we didn't get
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.240]   to try the thing they showed on stage, the background.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.360]   We tried the development version, which essentially is
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.960]   sort of a harness that goes on your head.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.720]   It has a backnut.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.120]   And then you have a big box that you wore around your neck.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.560]   And a lot of the coolness looked like it was in the
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.600]   industrial design of the final version.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.480]   Also, I wore glasses, my progressive lenses, and I
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.680]   really wide had.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   So when I wore the harness, I wore my glasses like this, and
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.640]   it looked blurry to me.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.800]   But then I asked the folks in my little group of
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.360]   journalists who don't wear glasses, and they said it looked
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.920]   razor sharp.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.120]   Paul and Mary Jo were blown away.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.840]   They said it looks better than in the video.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.880]   And I was pretty close to blown away, even with the issues I
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.120]   had.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.040]   It really is pretty amazing, especially the demo they had
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.080]   that was based on Minecraft, where they're a little--
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.480]   I want that.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.720]   Little buildings sitting around the conference room where they
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.960]   did the demo, and you can use explosives to blow up the
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.160]   coffee table in the conference room.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.880]   Minecraft alone sells it to me.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   You know what I'm saying when Microsoft buy Minecraft.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   So this is not like Oculus Rift.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   No, it's a tie-brad, because you can still see it from
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:36.840]   around you.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.360]   It's augmented reality.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.560]   It's a virtual reality.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.800]   It's not like Google Glass, and it's not like React, even
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.640]   though some of the technologies are similar.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.480]   And some people thought, oh, this is just a better Google
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.760]   Glass.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.280]   Google Glass is not this.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.920]   It's a screen above your eyebrow that you look at.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.800]   This, you're looking through the lenses, and you're seeing a
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.880]   virtual world superimposed on it.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.120]   And you're probably not out and about interacting with other
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.600]   human beings when you're using this.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.880]   No, in fact, I imagine.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.760]   I'm guessing that battery life is not going to be an issue
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.800]   because you'll be connected to a laptop or a computer much
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.200]   of the time.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.600]   I wouldn't guess.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.520]   Maybe, although, I mean, one of the big deals about it is
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.920]   there's an entire Windows 10 computer in this wraparound
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.000]   thing, so you don't need to be connected.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.200]   This is-- that was a good example.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.080]   And I show this really briefly in the video.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.840]   But Mary Jo said she really liked this idea.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.480]   Repairs.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.840]   So you've got the visor on, and you're saying, I need to
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.320]   fix my plumbing.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.360]   You can have an expert.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.640]   You can have superimposed on the thing you're fixing,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.480]   directions.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.520]   One of the demos involved installing a light switch,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.080]   which I did.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.400]   And there was a Skype call where you had somebody stepping
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.120]   you through it, and he was able to write an overlay on top
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.320]   of the light switch to show you what was what.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:44.600]   Very cool.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.680]   They also mentioned that NASA scientists JPL are walking
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.920]   on Mars to help direct the Curiosity rover.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.960]   They're doing this right now.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.880]   We saw that demo, too.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.360]   So this would be virtual reality in the sense that you're
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.120]   not seeing any of the real world.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.200]   Some of those kind of hyperad because you could see--
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.040]   Augmented reality.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.240]   --your desktop PC.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.960]   Well, it is, but when you're on Mars, you're not seeing--
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.600]   you're not seeing the world--
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.120]   your vision of the world is blocked by Mars.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.560]   And the demo we saw, it was sort of 80% blocked by Mars.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.000]   20% visible.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.040]   And part of it involves still using a desktop PC.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.560]   One of the things I like about this--
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.680]   the thing that makes me nervous when I put on Oculus Rift
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.800]   is maybe-- and maybe I'm abnormally paranoid,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.360]   but somebody could just come up behind me and hit me in the head.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.600]   Because you can't see anything.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.360]   You're really vulnerable, right?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:31.880]   We're rocking you.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.360]   --when you're wearing virtual reality headsets.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.480]   But this, you're seeing the world.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.040]   And this is just superimposing a user interface
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.080]   or a model or a Minecraft on the world or just a big screen TV.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.480]   I feel like this could be the future of UI.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.040]   And this is the same thing that company magically
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.760]   that Google mysteriously dumped $500 million into
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   and soon to purchase on the board.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.680]   If you look at their patents, it's almost exactly
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.720]   like what we saw from Microsoft.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.840]   This is going to be very similar.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.160]   A lot of people are betting this augmented.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.640]   The virtual reality thing, Oculus,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.440]   is quite different than that.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.520]   That's more for gaming and entertainment.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.360]   This is a computing platform.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.560]   This is a real thing that can potentially replace desktops
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.000]   and mobile devices and so forth.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's pretty exciting that we got to really see it
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.600]   for the first time.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.920]   And we saw it from Microsoft of all companies.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   And they managed to keep it secret until--
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.520]   --for some years.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.320]   As many as 1,000 people knew about it,
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.560]   they had different project code names given to different groups
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.680]   because if there were a leak, then they would know which
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.840]   group leaked it.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.520]   But it didn't leak.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.240]   I got the sense talking to some of the people who
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.800]   were doing the demos for us that some of them only knew
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.480]   about the aspect of what they had worked on.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.600]   Because if we asked them any question that was at all off
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.640]   scrapped, they seemed kind of clueless.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   And I think that might have been genuine rather than them
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.760]   continuing to keep secrets.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.120]   There's a few problems I can see for one thing.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.280]   User interface that requires your hands held out in front of you
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.320]   is limited in the amount of time you can-- that's tiring.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:13.040]   But I feel like this is the first new user interface I've
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.680]   seen in years that really has some promise.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.880]   We've seen a lot of things.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.080]   I had the Leap Motion thing where you--
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.800]   the Google Glass-- none of that stuff really sold me.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.000]   And people have tried it.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.520]   Agreed.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.560]   This is more than just a gimmick.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.760]   And you can also use that with a keyboard and mouse
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.960]   if that's--
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.360]   I definitely would in many cases.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.240]   And there are certain things like the data demo of sculpting
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.560]   3D objects.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.000]   We're using your hands made total sense.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.160]   Is this a gimmick, Christina?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.120]   I don't think it is.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.920]   I think that executions obviously
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   can become the really important thing.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.680]   And having that killer app right out of the gate.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.560]   I was reading something I think John Grouber linked to it
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.680]   earlier this week that someone who'd worked on Connect
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.720]   and Microsoft mentioned that it's kind of scary when
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.680]   people say, I can't wait for developers to get their hands
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.200]   on this because the answer really should be that you already
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.840]   have products that exist even without developers.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.920]   That can be sold on the basis of just the first party apps
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.840]   and first party experiences that come out of the gate
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.520]   with something.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.240]   And I think that's an important thing to keep in mind.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   But I don't think this is a gimmick.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.600]   I think that so many companies have
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.640]   been investing in this virtual reality, augmented reality,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.360]   kind of future UI stuff.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.240]   And Microsoft has come out of the gate
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.160]   and shown something that frankly, just the demos we've seen
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.920]   in talking to people like Harry and Lance Ulanov, who
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.200]   went for Mashable, who have played with it,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.720]   have come away really impressed.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.920]   And people who went in skeptical were really impressed.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.840]   And that's how long this will take.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.520]   And what the potential here is, I don't know.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.080]   But I think the potential is very real.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.280]   I don't think this is just a gimmick.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.760]   As long as out of the gate, there
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.840]   can be some sort of use case that makes itself apparent.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   And it's not one of those.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.760]   Now let's just wait for people to build stuff for it.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.480]   I do also think that unlike Google Glass, where the idea was,
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.600]   we're going to force everybody to use this all the time
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.920]   and be out in public with it.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.080]   And it will become an extension of yourself.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.760]   Microsoft is very much saying, this
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.080]   is something you use indoors.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.160]   This is something you use for certain experiences.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.200]   It's not something you use all the time.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.880]   And then maybe down the line, the goal
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.400]   might be, well, eventually this becomes something
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   that you want to have at all times.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.920]   But it's not as if they're selling this as part of a--
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.960]   your lifestyle has to be revolving around these ugly glasses.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.200]   In fact, at no point in any of the demos or videos
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.920]   do they show anybody outside the house, right?
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.800]   No, exactly.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.120]   And I think that putting it in those contexts
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.720]   and putting it in those--
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.960]   this is why you're using this.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.640]   This is why this will make things better, really
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.560]   gives rationale for why you're putting this thing on your face
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.520]   to begin with.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.160]   Versus just, I'm going to walk around with this on.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.800]   And everybody's going to love me or think
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   that I'm a total douchebag.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.000]   I think it makes it a lot easier to potentially adopt
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.520]   something if you can see it as a segmented part of your life.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   But imagine that in your motorcycle.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.760]   How about somebody saying it?
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.120]   Fell to saying in the chat room.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.040]   Imagine it-- unlike the Oculus Rift,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.360]   you could drive with these on and get valuable information
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.320]   in your surroundings.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.600]   But I think you're quoting the John Gruber piece.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.760]   That's Peter Molinow, who was a former Microsoft executive,
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.680]   not there anymore.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   But he does raise an important point.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.680]   It's great to look at this stuff.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.200]   But you've got to get somebody to develop software that
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.000]   works like this.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.840]   And that is nothing we've seen before.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.240]   This is all from scratch.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.560]   And it's kind of incumbent on Microsoft to do that.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.400]   Because one of the issues with Windows 8
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.960]   was they put out an all new computing experience
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   and then failed to build anything themselves.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.240]   That was all that compelling.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:51.200]   We still don't have the full-blown version of Microsoft Office
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   for the experience.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.120]   They actually just show that at this event.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120]   That's how you touch version.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.720]   Years after Windows 8 showed.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.080]   So I think--
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.840]   After the iPad version, you're after the iPad version.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.680]   So I think on day one, when this thing is available,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.920]   there have to be some Microsoft applications for it,
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.160]   which are really compelling.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.760]   I bet you-- and I think it would be sufficient,
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.440]   knowing quite a few 12-year-olds--
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.200]   that if they did Minecraft, they'd be done.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.880]   They would sell a lot of these.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.600]   All right, how many of you guys-- Minecraft,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.880]   if you could do this, you put on the thing
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.360]   and the Minecraft instead of going
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.680]   like this with your hammer hand.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.920]   You could draw and you could--
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.440]   If you look at this picture on the HoloLens microsite,
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.200]   if you go up to that fireplace and look through,
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.640]   there's another room that you're looking into.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.680]   You can look through a table.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.920]   If you bend down and look through the windows of these houses,
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.120]   there's things in there.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.360]   That means-- I mean, now Microsoft buying Minecraft
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   makes a lot of sense, frankly.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.920]   I mean, I think if you could do Minecraft,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.400]   if you could do AutoCAD, and if you could maybe do something
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.480]   with, I think, Skype, those--
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.920]   that might be enough, at least for an early product.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.320]   Two or 12-year-olds don't have $1,000 to pay for a HoloLens.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.800]   But if they did, I think--
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.000]   Mommy and Daddy do, though.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.240]   Dad, Mommy and Daddy--
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   All you have to do is tell Daddy--
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.200]   there's bikini-rich content.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.360]   Tell Mommy-- we'll have to think about you.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.040]   Tell Mommy to get her excited.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.360]   Bikini-rich content, come on.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.920]   Let's be equal opportunity.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.640]   OK, Mommy likes that, too.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.920]   Mommy likes Minibakeen.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.880]   Ryan Gosling is in there somewhere.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.280]   Look around.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   But I feel like--
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.960]   you're right, Minecraft's not enough in the sense
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.320]   that the constituency for Minecraft
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.240]   probably-- this has got to cost $1,000.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.200]   Or Google Glass with 50,000.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.360]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.400]   At least $1,000.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.880]   But I think about myself.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   I would pay $1,000 for this.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.560]   I think Glass was as expensive as it was,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.520]   partially to discourage everybody from super early adopters,
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.080]   from buying up.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.560]   I would spend $1,000 for this.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.040]   I would.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.720]   One thing that Microsoft really didn't talk about,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.000]   one of the many things they didn't talk about,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.880]   was really how the technology works,
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.280]   in terms of what you can see.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   There are some cameras in there.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.640]   This is from the Connect Division, right?
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.120]   So there's some Connect stuff in there.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.440]   The guy behind us is also the guy behind Connect.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   Yeah, Alex-- yeah.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.080]   Alex Kupman.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.760]   Kupman.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.360]   OK, so what do you think, Steve?
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.760]   Are you going to get in line?
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.680]   Oh, I'm definitely going to try it out, at least.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.400]   I mean, my colleague Matt Rosoff was also at the event.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.760]   And I mean, he wrote this in his hands-on experience,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.840]   and he was telling me, he's like,
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.440]   I haven't seen anything like this transformative,
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.800]   since I first touched an iPhone.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   And that is--
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.880]   It's kind of how I feel.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.280]   I kind of feel that way too.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.360]   And so that just got me super excited.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.760]   Because I mean, I've tried Oculus.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.080]   I got that Wo factor.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.600]   But I don't see it as a computing platform.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.520]   I see it more entertainment and social and gaming, of course.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.760]   This is everything.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.560]   This is gaming.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.800]   This is productivity.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.560]   And you just take the long view.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.160]   I mean, this is really close.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.880]   And I think another interesting thing is,
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.440]   this is the first time we're seeing Microsoft
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.000]   kind of show us something in their experimental phase.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.480]   Kind of do it.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.560]   That's very googly.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   Google showed us glass.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   They show us self-driving cars and tell us
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.440]   all these crazy projects they're working on that probably
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.560]   will never come out.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.640]   And to see Microsoft do, that's really interesting.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.360]   And you know, other companies like Apple,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.800]   they never show their hand.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.560]   And you know, you got to bet that they have something similar
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.920]   in their R&D labs right now.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.880]   But if we ever do see it, we're not
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.960]   going to see it until it's 100% finished.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.880]   There's a price.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.000]   There are apps and software.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.080]   And it's perfectly polished.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.560]   So it's kind of cool to see Microsoft get a little messy
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.960]   with this thing.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.200]   I feel like by keeping it secret for six years,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.760]   they kind of got the jump on some other companies.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.640]   Oh, I think they totally got the jump.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.760]   And I think what's really impressive is that--
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.360]   and I don't know what your perspective was, Harry.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.840]   But talking with Lance on Wednesday after the event,
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.920]   he said, you know, the experience
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.880]   felt really, really solid and a lot more
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.560]   finished than he would have expected.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.920]   The hardware itself is still very much in the prototype
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.680]   phase, which is to be expected.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.000]   And that didn't feel complete.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.280]   But the experience, the software, seems solid.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.200]   And that's encouraging to me because that's
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   what's going to make a break.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.920]   This will be how all the software works.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.280]   Because if, you know, I mean, it's great that they
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   are able to get these demos off for journalists,
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.880]   obviously, it will have to work in the real world beyond that.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.080]   But they're able to come to market,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.480]   even with something that's experimental,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.520]   the Steve's point that can work, that actually doesn't just
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.760]   seem buggy as hell and actually has a solid chance
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.600]   of actually being able to do something.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.760]   Yeah, I think that they have a humongous advantage
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.800]   and a humongous leap ahead of everybody else
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.720]   in this particular space.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.880]   My experience actually was kind of buggy.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.680]   There were some instances where I just didn't work.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.360]   But they have to be pretty close to done with us,
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.440]   because they said that it will ship in the same time frame
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.800]   as Windows 10, which means this year.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.640]   This fall--
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.440]   So they have to be really close.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.280]   And they have to have a lot of other stuff figured out,
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.720]   which they did not tell us about.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.880]   I assume there will probably be another event where they
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   lay out all the details about this thing.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.080]   The event you want to go to is at the end of April
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.240]   as Microsoft Build, which is their developers conference.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.800]   And I would guess that's where the other shoe will drop
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.400]   on this, where the SDK comes out, where maybe even they
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.360]   put a few of these under the seat.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.600]   Because if you want to get--
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.720]   I mean, you do need developers to write this stuff.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.760]   You do.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.160]   I mean, this is just anecdotal.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.120]   But developers that I've talked to who have been not
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.880]   interested at all, including my husband
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.520]   and building anything for a Microsoft platform,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.640]   I got him watching it.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   And he doesn't really pay attention to the news events.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.680]   And he started watching it and was like,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.560]   I want to build for this immediately.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.960]   And there were a number of developers
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.040]   I spoke to who were saying the same things.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.920]   And so whether it's just kind of the euphoria of this or not,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.760]   that was not the reaction that I got from Google Glass.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.000]   There was more of that with Oculus,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.280]   but most of it was gaming related.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:50.920]   Whereas this, I think you see a lot of different disciplines
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.440]   of people who could build software, who
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.920]   see a lot of opportunities.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.040]   I don't want to draw the iPhone analogy too close,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.360]   because I think it's a different thing.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.640]   But kind of the same way you saw a bunch of people who never
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.560]   saw themselves wanting to develop for macOS 10,
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.240]   were interested in the iPhone.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.040]   Microsoft has the potential at least
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.760]   of being able to bring in people who might not
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.160]   be interested in developing for Windows 10,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.920]   but would be interested in developing for HoloLens.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.960]   I have to say, when I was never impressed with Oculus Rift,
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.120]   I bought the Kickstarter and bought into it,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.160]   because I believe in VR.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.600]   And I want VR to be real.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   But there was a little whoa, and then there was a little--
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.600]   I'm nauseous.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   I always thought that augmented reality, not virtual reality,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   was the way to go.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.920]   I always wanted a heads-up display.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.880]   I always thought that maybe that's
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.640]   that paranoia about being hit in the back of the head.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.560]   But I just feel like people don't want to isolate themselves
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.000]   from the world.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.680]   They want to superimpose information and data
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   upon the world.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.120]   And this is such a-- it feels like such a natural way
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.200]   to do this.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.080]   And I know none of you are developers,
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.320]   but I'm curious what a developer might be thinking.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.240]   What does your husband think?
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.880]   How hard is this going to be to develop for?
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.680]   Yeah, I mean, that's going to be the big question, right?
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.600]   I mean, who knows?
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.960]   I mean, they're making it seem like you can take any Windows 10
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.880]   app and adapt it for this sort of environment.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.640]   And that might be true to a surface level.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.960]   But that's going to require people
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.080]   to start thinking in different dimensions,
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.440]   and in different axes, and in different scenarios.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.720]   But that's also exciting, right?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.840]   Because the first time now you're-- we're
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.800]   talking about this seems like the first new UI
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.920]   that we've seen in decades.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.360]   Since the mouse, since--
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   Exactly.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.720]   And so that's really exciting if you're thinking about, OK,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.360]   well, how do I now approach how to do some sort of interface?
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.320]   Or how do I now approach how to get something done?
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.280]   That opens up a tremendous amount of opportunity
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.320]   for people who really like to get into play with stuff.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.080]   But Harry, you and I are old enough to remember
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.800]   the stumbles that we saw when the mouse first--
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.200]   when people try to develop for the mouse,
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.960]   when the people try to develop for touch.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.640]   It takes a few years before people really get it.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.120]   Yeah, I mean, the mouse was invented in the late '60s,
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.800]   and it was the mid '80s, or maybe even a little bit
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.560]   beyond before it was really widely used.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.080]   And it wasn't great, frankly, until the Macintosh came to--
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.840]   And people were still--
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.920]   And people were still making fun of my even,
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.840]   like in the late '80s.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.360]   The Vorek.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.880]   People were saying they were silly.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.400]   Yeah, the Vorek.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.920]   I don't hear a lot of people saying it's silly.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.120]   The HoloLens is silly.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.840]   And I have to say, a lot of times at Keynote,
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.040]   there is this buzz.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.760]   It doesn't-- not just Steve Jobs, but in general,
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.000]   I often come off of Keynote's excited and jazzed
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.800]   for the future.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.560]   And so I'm really trying to parse this and think,
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.520]   is this just a little bit of reality distortion field?
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.560]   Or is this genuinely something people will develop for
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.320]   that will be genuinely useful?
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.240]   And I do feel like when people like Lance,
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   you know enough say that when people like Harry say it,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.480]   that there's something here.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.000]   And my gut is this is something very exciting.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.080]   This is--
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:03.240]   As the meme says, "Shut up and take my money."
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.360]   Totally.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.200]   Totally.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.680]   Can they make this for $1,000, Harry?
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.560]   You know, my guess is it might be less than that.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.680]   Really?
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.840]   But again, it's a little bit hard to know.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.720]   It's a PC, right?
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.440]   I mean, it's a PC.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.440]   I mean, some sort of PC.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.760]   We don't know, but we really don't know much
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.920]   about the components inside of it.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.160]   Yeah, what is the technology to project that?
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.520]   Is it projecting-- what was your sense?
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.160]   Is it projecting on the lens?
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.520]   What am I--
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.880]   It's projecting on the lens.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.960]   And there are some sort of cameras, basically.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.840]   Understand the surfaces in the room.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.600]   So it can say there's a table here,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.760]   and that it should project--
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.880]   Do you remember the Minecraft building on top of that table?
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.160]   You remember the weird demo that got me so excited
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.600]   with Xbox One of the Illumiroom that Microsoft did?
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.960]   Oh, no, it's awesome.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.560]   Oh, yeah, that was so cool.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:48.040]   This actually feels like the Illumiroom, like maybe they--
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.120]   maybe they were teasing us.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.080]   The idea was you'd be watching your Xbox,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.200]   and they would have a little device projecting whatever
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.400]   was on the screen out into the room.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.520]   So it kind of was peripheral--
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.680]   they call it peripheral projected illusions.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.000]   I'm wondering if this was Microsoft going, you like this?
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.760]   Wouldn't it be cool if it were more vivid and self-contained
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.680]   and real?
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.080]   Because this seems to feel like the Illumiroom a little bit,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.800]   only better.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.320]   That was--
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:18.960]   Way better, because--
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.480]   Way better.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.360]   Because you're not-- I mean--
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.800]   So it's projecting-- now, when you're not
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.280]   projected, are you looking through sunglasses?
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.760]   How dark are those lenses?
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.680]   They do seem to kind of impact how bright the stuff around.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.320]   So little dark.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.640]   It looked a little bit dim.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.240]   And did you feel like the frame rate was fast,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.440]   or did it even matter?
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.520]   Because unlike Anoculous Rift, where frame rate is everything,
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.760]   you're still looking at a full frame rate room.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.720]   The frame rate was good.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.960]   It's a little bit hard to describe,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.920]   but there's sort of a rectangle in front of your eyes,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.800]   and it's rendering stuff within the rectangle.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.120]   So if there's something going on over here,
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.400]   I have to turn my head.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.120]   So that space is in the rectangle.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.920]   I want to render it.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.600]   So it's not trying to render--
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.280]   Everything around--
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.120]   It's not like ref to it.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.640]   It's not like ref to it.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.560]   It's rendering everything around you all at once.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.400]   It's rendering the stuff right in front of your eyes.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.480]   I just feel like interacting.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.880]   And there must be cameras seeing your hands,
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.120]   because your hands, you can tap, you can point,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.080]   you can smooth.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.720]   You hold up your hand like this, and you go like that,
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.000]   and that's a mouse click.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.240]   And you have to be pretty precise about it.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.520]   OK, so here's one negative, because anybody
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.480]   who's ever used Connect with Xbox.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.000]   And this whole thing, you go, it doesn't--
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.120]   Like, where am I?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.240]   So frustrating.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.600]   But it also has voice input, which seemed to work pretty well.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.200]   OK, all right.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.120]   Very intrigued.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.600]   All right, we're going to take a break,
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.320]   come back with more whatever is left from the Microsoft
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:41.680]   announcement.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.240]   There was a big-ass TV, the Surface Hub.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.560]   We're talking about that.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.520]   Anything else, any other impressions
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.400]   you got from the Microsoft demo on Wednesday?
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.640]   And lots more tech news.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.000]   Harry McCracken is here, the Technologizer
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.800]   from Fast Company.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.600]   Great to have you back, Harry.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.720]   Christina Warren, who is the film girl,
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.160]   at the film_girl, she's at Mashable.com.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.680]   I loved-- and we showed it on the show--
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.880]   your video of trying to get the iPhone 6 caught in your hair.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.280]   I love that.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.640]   I can't do it now, my hair's too short.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.200]   It is.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:18.720]   It is.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.520]   But we couldn't do it.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.040]   We tried.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.680]   We could not get it done.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.840]   Loved it.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.320]   And then you've been doing some great videos.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.080]   What was the other one you were trying to eat?
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.480]   What was that?
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.880]   I chugged a surge on camera.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.640]   Oh, that's right.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.360]   It was that--
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.120]   a horrible power drink.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.680]   And you had your colleagues do it, too.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.400]   Yeah, they were all wusses.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.560]   And I chugged it in one shot.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.480]   And I was like--
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.840]   You were very impressive.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.040]   Much time spent chugging things, I guess.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.840]   So does, yes.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.920]   I drink way too much carbonated soda.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.560]   What can I say?
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   Stay away from that stuff.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.040]   I know.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.000]   I need to stay away from it.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.640]   It's bad.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.680]   Also, watch me chugge surge.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.520]   Awesome.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.240]   I'm going to-- man, here's the video.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.840]   Also here with the Steve Kovac from businessinsider.com
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.600]   at Steve Kovac.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   Surge is back.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.200]   What was surge, by the way?
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.760]   It's disgusting.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   It's about to--
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   It was just off for--
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.200]   It's about to.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.400]   No, it wasn't.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.360]   It was more like a more citrus leaf levered sprite.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.000]   It was a Coca-Cola product that came out in 1997
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.880]   and was sold in 2002.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.720]   And it's back now, which you can buy it directly from Amazon.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.440]   And should we buy some?
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.000]   Should we buy some?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.680]   Yes.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.320]   It's pretty good.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.080]   It's not bad.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.400]   I don't know if I'm Christine.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.120]   It's not bad.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.160]   And yeah, so they start cutting in.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.680]   Everybody else is drinking this and is complaining.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.040]   And then they just show me drinking.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.360]   She powers it down.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.360]   It's just like--
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.360]   I just powered it down.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:47.800]   Jug, jug.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.680]   You didn't stop.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.400]   You didn't breathe.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.200]   No, I didn't stop.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.120]   You didn't put in a glass.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:52.680]   Nothing.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.400]   No.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   Look at you go.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.880]   I'm going to be rich with some fries that you found in your cup holder.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.400]   Uh-huh.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.200]   We're there.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   Uh-huh.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   I got worse.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.680]   You're going to drown.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.960]   I'm going to be like--
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.760]   I'm going to drown.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.920]   I'm going to do a mistake.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.280]   And look at her eyes are getting bigger.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.360]   How many proteins?
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.200]   No, it was hurting at that point because it's so carbonated.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.440]   And then she crushes the can.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:13.920]   I'm going to do it.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.680]   That is.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.440]   But next time on the forehead, OK?
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.760]   Next time on the forehead, no.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.120]   I did a stressful fan one take.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   And I have to--
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.680]   If three-- my face was looking like that was basically
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.240]   because I was afraid that if I opened my mouth,
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.560]   I was afraid I was going to throw up.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.280]   That's right.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.520]   Our show today brought to you by Citrix.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.800]   Go to meeting the way to meet with clients and coworkers.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.400]   Sometimes you don't want to be in the same room
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.520]   with your clients and coworkers,
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.480]   especially if they've just powered--
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.280]   a whole surge down.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.040]   You might want to get on the other side of the room from them.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.360]   The way we work today with people,
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.440]   they're not in the same room.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.720]   They're all over clients, vendors, coworkers.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.800]   They're not in the same office.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.920]   They're not even in the same city or even country sometimes.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.280]   But you don't want to travel.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.320]   You don't want to waste the time or the money.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.960]   And communicating by phone or email, it's not personal.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.920]   Go to meeting.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.440]   Citrix go to meeting is personal.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.560]   It's the best way to meet from the convenience of your computer,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.120]   your smartphone, your tablet.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   You can see it is used all over the world.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.960]   You pay one low flat rate and hold as many meetings
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.320]   as you need, as long as you want with anyone, anywhere,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.800]   in one virtual space.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.680]   Share screens, present in real time,
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.520]   turn on webcams to see each other with high-def video
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.560]   conferencing.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.320]   You will engage.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.960]   You will connect as if you're in the same room.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.920]   We use it every meeting.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.280]   We love it.

[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.520]   I think this is the kind of thing.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:54.360]   And you can bet the folks at Citrix are getting the HoloLens.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.040]   And this is the kind of thing that would be amazing
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   to put on the HoloLens and see people in the meeting
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.200]   and then see the screen.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.240]   And uh-huh, can't do that yet.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.000]   But soon, go to meeting.com.

[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.720]   We thank them for their support.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   Of Twitch.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.680]   Anything else?
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.040]   Do we care about the Surface Hub?
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.000]   It looked kind of cool.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.520]   I do.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.080]   I thought that might be kind of the sleeper
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.920]   out of the whole event.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.640]   Interesting.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.440]   This is the perceptive pixel screen, right?
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.480]   That they bought at 55 or 84 inches.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.960]   Good branch.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.040]   Build in Windows 10 computer, touch screen,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.720]   a somewhat tweaked version of Windows 10.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.360]   The ability to, you know, special pens
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.560]   that let you take notes like a whiteboard.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.720]   It automatically sends all of those notes
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.000]   to everybody who was in the meeting.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.920]   That's nice.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.640]   Very easy sharing of your computer.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:45.040]   But you can't watch TV on it.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.760]   It seems like such a waste.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.600]   Does it have Netflix is the question.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.560]   I was going to say, if it has Netflix,
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.200]   maybe I'm OK with it.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.960]   It doesn't.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.120]   You can't watch TV on it.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.680]   It's a total office productivity thing.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.680]   You don't want people watching Netflix on you.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.520]   But you know, I must have an HDMI port you can connect.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.720]   We watch Netflix in our office.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.280]   What do you watch?
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:06.840]   I don't know.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.320]   It's like Topsburgers.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.200]   But I see girls in Topsburgers.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.120]   I love those.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.400]   I'm going to see it live.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.800]   They're doing a live show with the cast.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.320]   And I messed up.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   Are they going to let you sit in?
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.200]   You should sit in as Louise.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   Oh, that would be so good.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   Where are your hats?
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.960]   I will wear my hat.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.600]   I miss out on getting New York tickets.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.640]   But we're going to be actually taking the train
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.120]   to Washington, D.C.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.680]   Because I want to go that badly.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.640]   It's insane.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.040]   I know.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.800]   Actually, I know quite a few people
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.520]   who would do about live Bob's burgers.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.040]   Absolutely.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.600]   But back to the surface.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.160]   Back to the surface.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.880]   You can't watch Bob's burgers on it,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.800]   but you could design a future chair.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.720]   I can say.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.240]   Right.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.120]   You could design a future cartoon series.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:50.640]   But don't--
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.160]   aren't there a main things like this, Harry,
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.880]   in the business world now?
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.160]   I mean, I've seen screens like this for age.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:56.480]   Over there, yeah.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.440]   It's something at Tech TV.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.960]   We try to use something very much like this.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.200]   Over the years, there have been a variety of them.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.080]   And the potential of this is that that's--
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.680]   and this is a product that makes
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.640]   sense for Microsoft to use because from the hardware
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.240]   to the operating system to the services is integrated.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.520]   They tweaked the Windows interface for this.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.840]   Is that Jan a symbol of your reaction to this?
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.320]   Yes.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.400]   But I'm not an enterprise guy.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.200]   I do think it's interesting that Windows 10 can be mod--
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.320]   in some ways, this is a proof of concept
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.000]   that Windows 10 can be modified to fit different situations.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.480]   It's just a little tweak.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.320]   Like the start menu appears in the middle of the screen.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.080]   So you don't need to like flail around to hit stuff.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.360]   I have to say, I have seen a lot of these
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.440]   where they're just using stock Windows.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.120]   And that is not a good solution.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.680]   That's what they've been for years.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.040]   And it's not so cool.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.600]   This also reminded me of the original Surface table.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.520]   Speaking of Microsoft things, it really
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.680]   looked like they could be game changing and turned out not
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.880]   to be when that came out in 2007.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.120]   It was the first $4,000.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.040]   Well, this is not cheap.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.240]   Now, this won't be cheap either.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.000]   Which is the hub.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.760]   I mean--
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.640]   They haven't said yet.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.920]   But the perceptive pixel versions of these, which
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   did not have built-in computers, were not cheap.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.800]   Isn't that what Shepard Smith's using with the big--
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   The giant.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.040]   The giant iPads.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.040]   That weird thing that--
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.840]   I'm assuming I can find the picture of it.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.680]   It looks like he's got little gnomes working on iPads.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.680]   I don't know.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:28.040]   All I could find is Gawker articles about Shepard Smith now.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.000]   Man, one scandal is you're over.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   There he is.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.520]   There it is.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.360]   Those are perceptive pixels, right?
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:35.920]   I think they are.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.680]   Or something similar.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.720]   What's funny is the UI is not shrunk down.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.640]   I mean, it's not--
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.160]   Exactly.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.760]   It's like weird.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.840]   It's like big.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.280]   The software on this looked pretty natural.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.240]   This is better.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.200]   The hub is better than this.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.880]   So we got to replace these with--
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.000]   It really does look like they shrunk the people.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.480]   They didn't--
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.000]   They still only die.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.440]   People with giant iPads.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.960]   The gnomes on iPads.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.440]   I think we have a show name.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.840]   Gnomes on iPads.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.720]   You mentioned Spartan.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.280]   We didn't talk about this.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.480]   I'm not clear at exactly how different this is.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.920]   It's still using the same engine that Internet Explorer is,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.000]   the Trident rendering engine.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.920]   So it won't be under the hood any different than Internet Explorer.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.840]   So we're talking just about a new UI.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.120]   And a new brand.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.800]   And a new name, more importantly, because IE really friendly.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.680]   Isn't the quality brand it used to be?
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.400]   To their detriment.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.760]   I mean, I think that actually IE 11 is a pretty good browser.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.600]   And that people who have used it--
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.120]   And I have-- it conforms to standards pretty well.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.920]   The problem is that a lot of developers
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.120]   don't want to buy with IE.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.800]   A lot of users don't want to bother.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.480]   You say IE, they think IE 6, IE 7.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.120]   And so maybe it is best to do a score sure thing
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.320]   and come out with something new and let people know, hey,
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.200]   actually what we've been working on all this time
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.800]   is really good.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.920]   I think this will be a big deal, but they didn't--
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.320]   I mean, it's not part of the preview.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.080]   And they didn't really give us much information about it.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.240]   But the first time Microsoft has introduced a browser not
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.720]   called Internet Explorer, that's a pretty big deal.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.480]   Although this is the code name, Spartan.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.960]   Basically--
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   The code name is true.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.760]   They have not officially announced what this thing will
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.000]   be called.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.200]   I don't see them naming it Spartan.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.680]   That conjures up a half-naked man with a beard.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.840]   I don't think--
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.440]   It does.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:22.800]   Halo?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.200]   It does.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   Halo.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.560]   They have been the Cortana's from Halo.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.760]   Spartan's from Halo.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.280]   But I don't think Spartan--
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.920]   I don't think that's--
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.800]   but maybe call it Halo.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.120]   No.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.040]   That would be cool.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   I kind of like that.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   Master Chief?
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.360]   Anyway, it's a whole rebranding thing.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.320]   And like we already said, IE just has this terrible reputation
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   now, no matter how good it might be.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.280]   And also in Windows 8 and 8.1, it's confusing.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.040]   You have two Internet explorers, one for the desktop mode
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.800]   and one for Todd.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.840]   That's got to go.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.440]   That's terrible.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.280]   That's got to go.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.120]   Yeah, that's awful.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.160]   And based on the demo that we got earlier this week,
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.280]   it doesn't really do much.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.440]   What you can doodle on it, like sketch or something.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.720]   And it syncs with Cortana other than that.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.640]   It's just the browser.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.040]   So I really think it's just the branding thing
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.960]   and saying we're moving beyond the flubby,
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.920]   hot IE, they do with Hotmail when they made it into Outlook.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.280]   So that's all it is.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.800]   They should call it the covenant.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.200]   That would be cool.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.280]   So one of the chats said, call it Mosaic, which--
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.440]   I'm sorry, that's funny.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:28.960]   That's funny.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   That's funny.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.880]   Actually, I think Microsoft owns that trade name,
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.440]   didn't they buy Mosaic?
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.120]   I think they do.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.800]   I think they did, actually, because they bought it.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.080]   IE is based on Mosaic technology.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.640]   They bought it.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.240]   So they probably own the name.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:40.840]   It's Mosaic.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.520]   It's a good name.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.040]   It's a traditional kind of a traditional name.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.800]   That'd be interesting.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.920]   Microsoft not traditionally great with naming.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.760]   HoloLens is probably that name is probably
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.000]   the worst thing about the product.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   It's so bad.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.080]   It sounds like TSL, it's the hollow men.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.200]   It sounds like something's wrong.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.600]   And then they keep saying holographic.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.560]   That's not holographic.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.200]   No.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   It's not a hologram.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.880]   It's not a hologram.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.400]   It's not a hologram.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.680]   It's involved lasers.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.280]   There's no lasers, although that would be cool.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.600]   Can I get a head mounted laser with my HoloLens?
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.080]   Now, how much would you pay?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.760]   Yeah, they keep calling it a hologram.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.280]   And a hologram is something--
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.320]   It's not a hologram.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.520]   You don't need goggles to say a hologram.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.120]   Holograms are visible with the naked eye,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.200]   and that's not what this is.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.280]   Right.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.720]   Don't ruin our fun, Steve.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.520]   I just-- I just look forward to having
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.840]   the gym and the hologram theme song play every single time
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.480]   I get my HoloLens.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   That's all I want.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.000]   Holo.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.520]   Showtime Synergy.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.960]   They also keep coming up with names
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.560]   that they get sued over, like SkyDrive.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.640]   Not Metro.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.960]   Metro.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.640]   They put a lot of energy into these naming,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.400]   and then somebody comes along and says, oh, no.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.320]   We're a department store in Germany.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.000]   You can't use it.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.360]   And it's like, oh, OK.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.040]   Are we excited about mobile world Congress?
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.920]   It's coming up next month.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.480]   We're about a month away from Mobile World Congress
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.400]   in Barcelona.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   We're excited about Barcelona.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:02:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.920]   I'm excited about that.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.440]   You're going to go?
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.640]   You get to go?
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.200]   I'll be there.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.040]   Mike Elgin is going to be there from our team,
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.320]   and we're going to send a camera crew.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.360]   So we will have live coverage.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.760]   Well, it won't be live, because it's nine hours later,
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.840]   and we're in California.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.120]   So it's going to be like, we'll have coverage
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.200]   at the end of the day in our morning broadcast.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.720]   You get to go, Christina?
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.920]   I'm not going this year.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.120]   I've gone to the past.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120]   It's pretty cool, isn't it?
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.160]   It seems like it's cool with it.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:25.840]   It's a great show.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.760]   It's a very cool event.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.080]   I mean, it's a big phone show.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.600]   And what I like is that it truly is a mobile world Congress.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.560]   The international presence is so big.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.880]   In our North American bubble, we often forget about these huge
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.600]   companies that slowly kind of take over things.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.520]   And it's really nice to get the perspective of Asia and Europe
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.280]   and of other parts of the world that usually we kind of ignore.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.440]   Well, and we didn't see much a phone action at CES.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.920]   I think because of mobile world--
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.400]   Exactly.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.240]   Are you going to Barcelona?
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.040]   I'm not going, but I think it really
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.960]   is the most important single big--
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.880]   It's a big film now, the big show.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.920]   CES still matters, but not as much as mobile world Congress.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.000]   Just the phones are the single most important device.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.280]   Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S6,
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.920]   the next generation of its flagship phone.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.240]   Some rumors that they weren't going
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.160]   to use a Qualcomm chip in it, that they might use their own
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.680]   and in fact, internationally, Samsung often uses their own
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.520]   Exynos chip.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.960]   But in the US, they've been using Qualcomm.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.560]   Latest rumors that Qualcomm is in fact developing a special
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.400]   version of the 810, their 64-bit processor, Snapdragon
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.840]   processor for the Galaxy S6.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.200]   Also rumors that it will be less touch-whizzy.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   Nobody will cry about that.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.200]   That's Samsung's customization to Android.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.840]   Every generation of Samsung phone, most recently,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.960]   Note 4 has been less and less touch, was more and more
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.120]   kind of stock Android.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.480]   And I would love to see you move in that direction.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.000]   And maybe a better touch sensor, as opposed to the one on the
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.320]   S5, the equivalent touch ID, which is terrible.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.480]   Oh, the fingerprint thing is awful.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.240]   You have to like slide.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.280]   You're very precise.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.480]   I have a note for which I love.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.640]   And I have to say, even with the wonky fingerprint reader,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   that's better than entering a password.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.440]   And you can use it in a lot of places where you had an
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.160]   error password.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.960]   But yeah, it's like a pill, avoid kind of shape.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.880]   And if you slide your finger on it, you can do only three
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.800]   fingers.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.360]   And almost every time you have to do it two or three times.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.880]   Oh, tilt your finger a little more that way, a little more
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.320]   than--
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.520]   And you contrast that with touch ID, which works so well.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520]   But doesn't Apple have the patents?
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.720]   Can Samsung make it better?
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.080]   Yeah, I've heard from people at Samsung that part of the
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.360]   problem is the patents and they'd have to find some kind of
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.160]   work around whether it's through software.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.240]   But Apple has that authentic technology.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.240]   They want authentic.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.560]   Yeah, so that just blows everything away.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.960]   I mean, the Synaptex is a company that has a lot of
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.880]   technology here too, which I think maybe Samsung has been
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.080]   working with.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.200]   It is real--
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.040]   It's the Samsung touch setter is the same kind of thing
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.240]   you saw in Lenovo's.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.720]   We've seen these for years.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.200]   You swipe it.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.960]   And it was such a revelation when Apple released Touch ID.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.880]   And you just lightly place your finger on it.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.120]   You don't have to move it.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.240]   And it almost always knows that it's you.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.360]   And it's gotten better.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:21.800]   Yes.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.040]   I tried to use it for the past year.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   So on the software level, they've just been able to make
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.880]   it so much better just in iOS.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.360]   That's amazing to me.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.320]   It's just compared to what it was like a year, year and
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.520]   a half ago.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.600]   So I don't know if anybody else does this, but since Steve
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.200]   and I are both about to be facing the brutal snow, I have
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.720]   trained a few of my capacitive touch gloves.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   Yes.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.800]   And I've used the glove fingers.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.760]   I've trained them to touch ID.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.960]   You can't do that.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   You can't do that.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.480]   Awesome.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.320]   What do you mean?
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.920]   Do you have to use the same glove each time?
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.560]   There's no whorls and swirls in your glove.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.040]   I'm not sure how it works, but I've
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.480]   been able to go to work.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.400]   And it's awesome.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.360]   That seems like that undermines your security
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.120]   a little bit.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.960]   It might, but I don't care because it's just
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.240]   these I don't have.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.080]   I'm awesome.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.000]   I've got my little thumb on.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.200]   Fantastic.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.400]   It's so funny, though, that there's so many people who
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.960]   don't really get why Apple Pay is a good idea.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.560]   There's so many stores where you use--
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.000]   well, John just experienced that.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.680]   Where was that?
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.320]   That happened to you.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.960]   Lucky store, the grocery store here in California,
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.640]   he used his touch ID and it said, OK, what's your pin?
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.240]   No, first it said cash or credit, debit, credit or debit.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.880]   Because I guess you used a debit card.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.560]   So then it has to add-- it's not like just touch and go.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.480]   Then it's going to say, well, OK, do you want to credit
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:40.800]   or debit?
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.600]   And he said, debit, no.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.120]   OK, what's your pin?
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.280]   So that's not much--
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.080]   do you want to cash back?
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.920]   It's much, much better than now.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.280]   Then now there's a lawmaker in Missouri who says,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.760]   he wants to make a law in Missouri
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.560]   that you have to show ID when you use Apple Touch ID.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.480]   You have to show your driver's license.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.200]   Otherwise, the merchant will be held responsible.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.360]   Oh, for a frax sake.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.560]   For a frax sake.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.560]   For crying out loud.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.680]   Representative Joshua Peters of St. Louis
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.320]   requires customers to show a state's driver's license
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.760]   or other than an application when they use a mobile wallet
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   app or other electronic payments.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.880]   It says, we just want to make sure it's you.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.720]   You could be using a glove instead of your fingerprint.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.520]   That's true.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.440]   You could be.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.360]   I think when you use your glove and it works,
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.200]   they should haul you in.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.600]   And they should make you-- they should take DNA
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.520]   to make sure it's you.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.880]   I think part of this, though, you've
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.600]   got to figure there's a little bit of lobbying
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.640]   going on from merchants who say, but with that,
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.080]   Touch ID, we don't know who it is.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.360]   We would really like to know who you are.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.040]   And in fact, this bill will record the driver's license
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.200]   number in a database.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.120]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   That's nice for a politician.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.320]   That's really care so much about our transactions.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.920]   I was going to say, thank you.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.680]   Thank you so much, Mr. Missouri guy.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.640]   I really appreciate it.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.840]   Joshua, what's your face?
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.320]   You think I think--
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.640]   Thank you.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.920]   You know, Walmart got to him.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.720]   I think we should look to see who his--
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.480]   Who's me, the distributors are.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.160]   Who's Donates.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:13.680]   Who's Donates.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.240]   That's the MCX lobbies.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.320]   M-H-T-C is expected to announce a new device
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.880]   for at Mobile World Congress to replace
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.640]   the very beautiful, highly reviewed M8.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.040]   You can no longer get a Google Play edition of the M8
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.160]   on the Google store, which means there is no longer
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.560]   any GPE version of any non-Nexus device on the Google Play
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:37.760]   store.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.160]   That's kind of sad.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.600]   But maybe this is-- I'm hoping this is preparatory
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.640]   for a new Samsung phone, a new HTC phone.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.680]   I wonder what HTC can do, though.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.280]   Phones are pretty close to perfect, aren't they?
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.600]   More battery life?
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.680]   Yeah, that's the big thing.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.800]   More battery life.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   I don't know what else.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.080]   That's a shame about HTC.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.840]   Why is that?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.480]   Shame on HTC makes such good stuff.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   I mean--
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.320]   Oh, the shame that nobody buys it.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.400]   They're better than Samsung.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.640]   Depends-- I think they're better than Motorola, too.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.440]   They're the M8, better than Moto X.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   No one's buying it.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.240]   It's ridiculous.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   And it's so sad that this--
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.200]   I meet with these companies all the time.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.640]   And HTC, they have such focus and such a great vision.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.440]   And no one buys into it.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.280]   They're losing out.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.560]   I really think just Samsung are launched
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.000]   by outspending them on marketing.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.320]   And that was that.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.120]   Well, maybe now that Samsung's stumbling,
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.520]   there is an opportunity.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.960]   Among other things, they say that I think one mistake HTC
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.040]   made with the M8 was the four megapixel camera.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.600]   And I know you can make a long case
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.840]   for why the ultra pixel makes sense.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   But people just go, no, I want a 13 megapixel or better
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.520]   camera according to rumors that the M9, which
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.440]   will be announced at Mobile World Congress, or maybe even
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.200]   sooner, will in fact have a high megapixel camera.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:11.680]   I think the rumor I heard was 13.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.720]   I don't know.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.480]   I hope it still has the boom sound, the dual speakers
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.200]   in the front.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:16.700]   Although--
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.800]   I think it will do.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.880]   Somebody pointed out--
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.720]   There's things I think right now.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.560]   That's a bad idea because-- what do you think of this?
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.880]   Because front firing speakers are not
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.320]   going to have any base because the back firing speakers,
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.080]   you can get some more resonance off the table or the back
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:29.920]   round.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.840]   So no, you just-- Chris are intern who likes HTC One,
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.560]   which he no longer has because it broke.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.120]   But he went like that.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.720]   No, you disagree?
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.800]   John's also crazy.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.720]   John thinks Chris is crazy.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.880]   We've got an epidemic of people going with their fingers
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.080]   around their head like that.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.160]   I'd be very interested to see what they do with the M9,
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.680]   actually.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.360]   I think they've got great designers there.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.560]   Are they hanging on by a thread?
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.720]   Steve, are you worried they--
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.840]   They were profitable last quarter barely.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840]   They got back in the black.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.920]   I mean, a big part of their strategy this year--
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.560]   and I met with them at CS, and they told me this all
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.600]   on the record and so forth.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.360]   But they're going to make an internet of things play.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.200]   They're going to-- they talked a lot about Nest,
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.360]   which I thought was interesting.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   And they thought Nest was an interesting company
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.000]   because they make a few products really well,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.840]   and they want to do that.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.600]   So they're going to have some sort of appliance
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.760]   later this year.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.120]   And they think that's part of a bigger play.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.520]   But I want a better camera.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.400]   I have that three cameras.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.160]   I kind of like the three.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.800]   You know what they did?
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.120]   They made the rea--
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.640]   the rea is dopey because it's not as good
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.800]   as your smartphone camera.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.680]   It looks like a periscope.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.440]   So it's a very wide angle, and there's distortion.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.160]   And the videos are-- you got a smartphone.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.120]   You don't really need a rea.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.440]   But you know what they did that was really smart?
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.360]   That I love?
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.880]   You can press the button and stream directly to YouTube live
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.360]   with a rea.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.520]   That's cool.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.080]   That-- they just added that in there,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.520]   and actually bought a rea because of that.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   Like, I'm going to be some YouTube vlogger.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.520]   I-- nobody wants to see me chugging anything.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.400]   But I'll show you the video because we--
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.960]   wow, look, 260 views.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.800]   I'm-- I've been doing this in meetings and stuff.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.000]   This is streamed live directly from the rea.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:19.880]   Listen to the audio, though.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.480]   It's pretty good.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.480]   I've been shooting all week long at meetings and so forth.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.120]   The idea that I can stream just that easily to YouTube--
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.040]   Yeah, and that was really easy.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:27.560]   Why?
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.840]   Because it's not just a button and it just streams.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.040]   So you got to be careful you don't take it
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040]   in the bathroom or something.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.880]   But--
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.040]   I mean, this wasn't the most compelling stuff I ever did.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.360]   But I streamed the engineering meeting.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.280]   I don't-- you know, I should see.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.480]   I can see what you're right because--
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.200]   Look at these guys.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.200]   Just look bored.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:47.960]   I think it's just a question you may not
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.760]   can't have one in your mouth.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.120]   Oh, they're bored.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120]   There's--
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.200]   OK, maybe it's not such a good idea.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.600]   I thought it was a good idea.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.240]   Let's take a break.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.480]   We're going to talk about Uber.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.640]   They're at it again.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.120]   Verizon's tracking cookies and a whole lot more.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.400]   Box went public.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.480]   Big IPO, which seems odd to me because if I were in that business,
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.200]   I would think that my days were numbered, but maybe not.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.760]   Stamps.com, folks.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.680]   Let's talk about it.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.200]   This is a great product for anybody who does shipping
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.920]   or uses the US mail for invoices for brochures.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.520]   The last thing you want when you ship something is to--
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.880]   you have a bunch of stamps on there.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.320]   And then there's not enough for you.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.840]   Put too many so that there's not enough.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.600]   Stamps.com just makes it all so much more professional.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.920]   You never go to the post office.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.480]   You use your computer, your printer
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.200]   to buy and print official US postage for any letter,
