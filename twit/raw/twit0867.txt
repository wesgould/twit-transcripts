[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech. We have it all in studio panel today.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.840]   I think you'll be able to tell the difference. Owen J. J. Stone,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.800]   Oh, Dr. Sitin' to my left. On my right, I've got Jason Snell from sixcolors.com
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.360]   and Ian Thompson of the register.com. It's gonna be a big show we're gonna talk about.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.560]   Of course, the new Mac Studio. Jason has a review. I have some benchmarks.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   Who should buy it? Who should not buy it? Coming up. Also, we'll take a look at the display.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.560]   A little bit less of a satisfying product. A Facebook deep fake of President Zelensky.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.920]   Would you be fooled? And how Amazon made it harder to cancel Amazon Prime.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. Show where we cover the latest Tech News. Happy spring
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.600]   everybody. First day of spring we thought, hey, COVID's all over. Let's just bring as many people
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.360]   in the studio as possible. Actually, you started at Owen J. J. Stone O. Doctor because you came to
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   town. I am to blame and I appreciate the blame being put upon me. When the doctor comes to town,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280]   it's a party. Look at this. There's like 9,000 people on the other side of these cameras. They'll
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.080]   never know. What do you call that thing on your head? So do you know, so I'm wearing a jersey that
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920]   is not my own. And what happens is people know that I'm a Philly guy. That's an NFL jersey. How
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.240]   we long represent Oakland right now. Yeah, throw it back. So this is the fanatic. The Philly fanatic.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   Is it beak knows? Not gritty. No, no, yeah, yeah, not gritty. Just the fanatic. So this
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.120]   this represents my Philly hoods. They know that I'm out here. I represent both sides. So that's
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.840]   what you call that to do. Rag or just to do band? I think they call it a fanatic band.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.680]   Because of the eyes like when I bought it. They don't they don't go down over your eyes just for
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.640]   a minute just so we could see what it would. Yeah, it's perfect. You could be a Mexican wrestling.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.760]   Yeah, if I could put my mask on and just rob someone right now, like is your is your is your
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.400]   studio in the studio? Yeah, because I will burglar. Yeah, take my studio and that's how we'll get
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.120]   that. Good look. Good. Oh, well. Also with this sitting to this is so awesome. I'm so in love with
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.680]   this sitting in the studio. Also Ian Thompson for the register dot com. We brought in all my
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.760]   favorites today because let's have fun, right? Good to see you Ian. Oh, it was a pleasure. Watch.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   Oh, I could touch him. He's a person. He's a person. He's not an avatar. He's not imaginary.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.680]   Love to have in you. It's great to see you. And from six colors dot com. A guy's probably pretty
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   busy right now. Jason Snell. I barely fit at this table. There's so many people at it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.240]   It's huge. I know. I know. I once hosted an episode of either Twitter, Mac Break Weekly,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.880]   where I was the only human being in here and it was all boxes and. Welcome to my life for the last
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.040]   two years. It's terrible. It's very just much harder to not have humans around you. Much harder.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.960]   People don't understand. I mean, because the sound quality is good and if you're only listening
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.720]   and even with the avatars, you almost feel like somebody's there as you're watching at
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.280]   home, but what you're missing is there's no interpersonal communication. There's no body
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.520]   language. Yeah, you can't just sort of toss ideas backwards and forwards. I found this in the
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.760]   office environment as well. One of the, you know, I think one of the things the pandemic has really
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.960]   shown up is the real failings of video and I am. Yeah. It's a way of, you know, keeping
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.720]   team casiveness together. If there's any reason people might want to come back to work, it's that.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.200]   Yeah. No more of this. No more zoom in. Who's zoom in whom? At the same time, as men who are
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.640]   older, imagine if this would have happened in 1980. What would you have done? Who are you going to call?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.960]   So, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you be sitting on the phone. Yes. So as bad as it was,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.320]   not great. At least we had the technology now to deal with things. Yes, it is great to see you,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.960]   but technically we've never met before in person, but I know you're really champion.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.920]   Yeah. Like, and it's just from, so it's, it's such a weird thing because like, yes, back into the world
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.280]   and joined the world. But thank goodness we had what we had, even in the failings to be able to
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.400]   use those tools. So, you know, yin and yang on that. But yeah, great to be back in person. So,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   and still drinks from the fridge. If someone at Twit, if you're missing two of the lemonade
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.800]   blueberry things, it was Leo. That's for you. No, I didn't think. In fact, if you want alcoholic
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.640]   beverages, adult beverages, you're more than welcome. We could do that. I have some nice cognac.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.960]   I have some reposado, Miss Cal. You do have good things. I have some, we have booze.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.600]   Yeah. In fact, I hate to say it. Our entire marketing team is in house. Michael O'Donnell
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.040]   at photos on the Twitter. He's a professor here. He's a pro photo. We, whenever we can
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.320]   have people in the studio, we get him. So, we have real pictures for the website.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   Anthony Nielsen is here wielding the Steadicam for, I don't know what, some sort of back of the
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   scene. He's, he's doing back to the work over there. He's good. But he's also a great mixologist.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.600]   So, if you have an urge for something, find me the most expensive thing and make it to go.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.640]   I want him back. I'll take a stick in my backpack. And Ashley's also here in our marketing department.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.960]   So, obviously, this is a red letter day for something. I don't know what. We're back in person,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.400]   baby. Yeah. I mean, you got to put a little effort over here. You know what I mean? Get
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.880]   it while getting this good until he shut his back down again. You know? That's, that's, I kind of feel
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.240]   like, you know, this could be just another brief interregnum in between. Let's do what we can.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.880]   Yeah. Very least, right? Yeah. Well, anyway, we're so glad. I don't have to tell you to turn
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   original audio on or anything. This is great. This is great. Max Studio came on Friday for some
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.840]   of us. You got your Max Studio? Yeah. I got a review unit. So I've been, I had it a week before.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.640]   Yeah. So actually good. This is good. Because I noticed that the embargoes were lifted Thursday,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.840]   the day before they arrive for real people. Right. Six AM. So all the YouTubers, I was amazed how
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.960]   many YouTubers got Max Studios from Apple, like dozens. People I never heard of. They're kind of
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   a target audience. So Apple, Apple really tries to get people's hands on them who are going to be
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.400]   able to appreciate them. And the studio has enough power. I think they figure the people who work
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.720]   in video every day are people who are going to be able to put it through its paces and
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.280]   that's the kind interpretation pro or whatever. The unkind interpretation would be give it to
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.640]   people who have no journalistic ethics who will say, Hey, look what Apple sent me. This is great.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   I think that what there was a fair share of that too. Yeah, sure. I mean, I think both of those
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.800]   things are true. But I think sending it to somebody who works in video who's going to be like, Oh,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.080]   my God, look at this export is going to be a good story for Apple to tell about that. And the,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.000]   you know, the usual suspects like me got them too. Although I didn't get the ultra, they only sent
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.880]   me the Max. And if I've heard the rumor got the ultra, I just want to say, I know you should feel
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.240]   bad. I do feel bad that you're now you know where you're in the pecking order. You know,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.160]   they never they think of me as a writer and they're like, well, you don't need all that,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.040]   all that power. And I'm like, guys, have you seen how much processor isotope audio plugins use?
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.720]   I use them all the time. It's brutal. And that's why I bought an iMac Pro, which I was using for a
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.360]   lot of time. But but I did buy one of these. And the funny thing about this Apple Silicon world
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.560]   we're in now is what I've learned so far is if it's got the same chip in it, it's the same.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   It's the same clock speed. Yeah. For sync. And if you look at benchmarks, now Tom's hardware has
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.800]   done them. Ours Technica and Rick Cunningham and did a whole bunch of good benchmarks.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.840]   If you look at the single core performance, it's identical across the board. And the multi core
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.280]   between yeah, the same the same core, right? The M1s are all one core. And then if you look at
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   multi core, we finally have another Mac to compare to the Mac with Pro. So if you get a same configuration,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.040]   like a 16 inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max, and you compare it to the Mac Studio, it's the same
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.600]   computer. So max equals max. Yeah, if it's an M1 Max, it's the same. Even though the power can be
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.520]   different because now you're plugging it in. I'll tell you one thing was very impressive with the
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.360]   Mac Studio. The cooling subsystem in that is great. The fan, I'm sorry. What do they call them? The
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.040]   turbo snots? What are they? They've got a name thrusters got a brand the thrusters come on right
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.720]   away. Yeah. And stay on and don't go up or down. It doesn't get so I ran Alex Lindsay's
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:57.040]   world famous Mac buster, the photogrammetry program. It's actually a Russian company had to
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.800]   turn off my my blocking on my ubiquity. So I could download this. It is a program that takes
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.760]   a bunch of photos and then mushes them together and builds a 3D model out of it.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.400]   Mega shape. It's called. And the nice thing is runs on windows Mac and Linux. So I can do some
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.280]   benchmarking across here. This is a shot as it was just wrapping up. Look at the cores.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's on my desktop. I know it may be confusing. It looks like I've got a Mac.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   On the right, those all that green, that's 100% every single core efficiency course,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.120]   performance scores and still and it was did that for 20 hours at no point did the fan get louder
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.680]   or did the machine feel hot or even the air coming out of the back. It might have gone up a
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.800]   degree or two. The cooling subsystem on that and this was the max of the ultra rather. So as the
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.600]   copper is incredible. So incredible. So that's what I'm excited for right because this is
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:02.320]   the Max Pro and this is now a Frisbee desk to me. I bought the M1. But that's that's Jason's
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.520]   point. I bought I bought it. It should be a Frisbee. So here's why it is one. I got the Mac mini
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.240]   M1 and I was like, all right, this is cool. It kind of does what I want because I'm shooting
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.080]   stuff in 8K. So I'm throwing hard stuff at it and it worked like, Oh, cool. And 4.2.2. It worked.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.120]   When I got this, I said, Oh, the game has changed. This thing is you would hope is this thing that
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.760]   was eating through it and it's making everything that I want to do easier. So I thought to myself,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.600]   one, this is a brick. I know the 16 is better than 14. That's why I got it. But I got my
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.240]   ultra sitting home waiting for me. So when I get home next week, I'm gonna I'm selling this thing
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.600]   because I don't need it because ultra is it's literally twice. Yes. Of what the max is. So if you
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.080]   if you buy the base model, you know, and all of those in there of the studio, you're getting,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.600]   especially since the 16 inch MacBook Pro has a little bit better cooling system. And that's
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.120]   it's identical. You know, there might be a little throttling occasionally on the 14, but on the 16,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   the M1 next chip, it's the same performance. It's just it's literally the same computer in a
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   different box. Yes. But when you get the ultra, then you're getting double that double that
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.560]   performance. And I'm excited for that. Like I have trashed Apple for three or four years because I
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   have a thread for I got 128 gigs of RAM. Like I'm just like, dude, what are you talking about?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.040]   I got 30 70. Like I'm destroying everything I want to do for the most part. This is faster than that
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.760]   now in a laptop form. And I got to say Apple got me back on that. And already doing this,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   taking my money and my child's education is in danger. She took me out when she saw me
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.560]   ordering it. She's like, what are you doing? I said, I need it. She's like, you don't need it.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.520]   But I do. So I might I might have to replace my kid with the ultra because I'm so excited to get
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:49.360]   home. Vadim on the Max tech channel actually took his apart. Yeah. And the first thing I felt
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.520]   bad for Vadim here, he is comparing, by the way, an AMD Ryzen to the ultra. Let me pause that
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.960]   briefly. The ultra is this is where the thermal paste was over that Apple. So that's the actual
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.440]   outline of the CPU. The rest is system on a chip. So that's where the RAM is and the and the AI
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.760]   processor and the video playback and all that stuff. This is the Ryzen CPU. And you could see,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:22.400]   it's a little bigger. The die itself is huge. And I was very impressed at how well put together.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.760]   It was I felt bad for Vadim because he had to put it back together. It didn't look like that
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.080]   was going to be much fun. This is not a system design. That's the Mac Pro is for right, a system
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.640]   design for you to break it open. This is not a system for regular people. And yeah, unlike the
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   old Mac mini, you don't need to spudger a paint chip or anything. I mean, there are, if you take
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.560]   the rubber ring off on the bottom, there's screws for screws, take those off, more screws, more
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.680]   screws. He did discover a couple of interesting things. Not I was not as surprised as he was.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.720]   There's two of these memory sockets for storage. Now, Apple said these are not upgradable. And in
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.320]   fact, these are these are the same SSD chips as on the other side where there's an SSD. So
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.400]   it's clear this is for various builds. It's the build to order
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.520]   configuration because they don't want to build different versions. Why would they have different
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.720]   motherboards? And the question is, so could I add later, problem is that the storage controller is
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.360]   on the system on a chip. So, and they do a security thing where it's paired to the system on the chip.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:25.760]   So I think the truth is you might be able down the road, but not yourself. Go into an outdoor
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.280]   or unauthorized repair center and get new storage put in and repaired. But Apple has to make this
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   storage first of all, because it's an on standard proprietary shape. Yeah. And you have to do that.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.280]   So I could see maybe Apple offering it as an upgrade, but it's but this is not this is not
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   mean you have an upgradable system. This is a trend for them too. First off, like, I think if
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.600]   you pay attention to what I fix it has been noticing lately, Apple stuff seems to be more
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.840]   repairable in general lately. They seem totally repairable. They seem to have heard the pain of
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.760]   everybody trying to fix things and it costs Apple too when they do Apple care, right? They have to
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.920]   take these things apart that are not meant to be taken apart. So that's that's part of it.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.840]   I don't know. It the other thing is if you look at the display, which we haven't mentioned,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.240]   the studio display, we're going to get there. That that also has a non-replaceable part,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.520]   which is it's got three different stand options. Same story. My understanding is that
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.480]   authorized repair centers or Apple repair will be able to switch those stands out for a fee.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   So it's not that there you could get the V-sim down. Yeah. If you wanted to,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.280]   if you said, "Oh, I like the pivot $400 extra," but I want to guess it. I can believe I bet you
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.080]   review. And I was like 400 bucks. Yeah. That's outrageous. Yeah. There's so much there. But anyway,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.320]   that is we should talk about that at some point. But my point is there are a bunch of things that
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.600]   are like not upgradable that might actually be upgradable, but only through the official path.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.560]   Yeah. This is the motherboard, the logic board. It is not very big. It's really a thin little
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.880]   piece of baloney in a giant sandwich. The bottom part is the 370 watt power supply,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.360]   which is built into the thick Mac studio. The top part, about half of it, is those fans,
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.560]   those thrusters, the blowers. Somebody told me, "Don't call them fans. They're blowers. I don't
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.840]   know what's the difference. It's a fan. It takes air, pushes it out the back in an L shape,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:22.720]   sucks it up, pushes it out. This is a very, if you look at the engineering on that,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.840]   very impressive, given what this thing does. And it shows you where Apple Silicon
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.040]   is really kind of lapping everybody else. This is all a system on a chip that does most of what
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.720]   you want to do. It's close to something perfect that I've seen in a really long time. It's really
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:43.120]   beautiful. And I, again, I'm not a, the old embargo life of YouTube just turns me off because I know,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.560]   yes, it's for people to get excited about things. And I'm like, I really appreciate balance in things.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.400]   So when I have to fanboy out and geek out like I have over these last Apple products,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.880]   it makes me sick a little bit. But it really, this is the first time they've had magic in a long
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.320]   time. They don't even use that terminology anymore. But this is magic. This is a gateway and path
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.840]   that other companies cannot follow. It's very good for Apple. The one thing that they have that
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   is against them, but for them is their walled garden. And everyone else has to work together.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.240]   And now they're going to have to have a superhero team to try and defeat the evil empire of Apple
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   when the empire is working in a unison form. And they are putting out power. This is impressive.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.080]   Yeah, you can bet Intel AMD and video all trying to duplicate this, but they don't control the
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.440]   stack the way the Apple controls everything. Unless you're, you know, again, joining forces and
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.040]   coming up and saying, Hey, at least let us combine our powers to make this. You can't compete right
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.640]   now with this. And the only thing that's keeping regular people out is one, they can't afford it.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.480]   Yep. Two, the system isn't in place for them to switch over. So a lot of people are like, look,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.840]   there's things that won't run on Mac. I can't switch to Mac. I don't care how much power it is.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.040]   I'm used to using a game or you're not even looking at this with Jell D.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.120]   Exactly. Because it doesn't compete at the games. But it is impressive,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:09.520]   annoyingly enough to say. So impressive. This is I should come back around to this mega shape.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.560]   We'll talk more about this with Alex on Tuesday on Mac break weekly. But just to give you some
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.920]   idea, I thought, Oh my God, this thing is slow. It took a total of 20 hours,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:27.120]   go close to it, 18 hours to do the entire photogrammetry. And so I said, Alex, 18 hours,
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.720]   this is a long time he had given to I just even the Mac Pro came out. I don't know what the Mac Pro
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.000]   numbers are. I'll find out. But he said, No, no, on my 16 inch I nine MacBook Pro, it went for
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   three days then crashed. So so at least it's finished. And it did it in less than 72 hours,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.640]   didn't about let's see, three and a half to do the alignment of the photos,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.200]   13 and a half to do the build cloud, the build meshes a half an hour.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.960]   It didn't finish building textures before I had to come in here. But I think it had another half
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   hour to go. So I'll say 18 hours, maybe fast. That's pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.680]   But the here's okay. Now the most important thing, the bottom line. If you're doing photogrammetry,
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.600]   yeah, you should get an ultra. Sure. I mean, that that is the question of like,
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.320]   what is an ultra four versus like an M1 Mac? And I think the answer is they are increasingly
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   narrowing the slice of the market that needs the hardware, right? Like the you know, you need
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.200]   so powerful already that I with those isotope plugins and all that, I'm like,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.760]   this is probably more than I need, but it's going to last me for a few years. And that's fine.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.000]   Did you notice your processing was faster? Oh, God, yes. And I was coming from it was only
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.960]   eight core Xeon, but eight core Xeon from a few years ago. And it's not even close. Plus,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   you know, the story just twice as fast as it was on my old iMac Pro. But the ultra then is double
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.520]   that and there's a Mac Pro waiting out there, which at least the rumor is will also come in a
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   two ultra configuration with 40 cores. Yeah. I think what's really funny though, I mean,
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.920]   I do think the competition is going to get their act together. I think that you're going to see
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   a lot of people following what Apple has done and realizing they need to change their game a
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.520]   little bit and up their game. I think what's funny about this story is what we were talking
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.320]   about a year or two ago that we're not talking about anymore, which was there wasn't any doubt
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.640]   that Apple was going to be able to make something like this laptop here, which is an M1 MacBook Air.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.560]   There wasn't really any doubt of like, take an iPhone chip or really an iPad chip, stick it in
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.720]   a MacBook Air. Sure, sure, you could do that. That'll be fine. But what about Pro systems? That
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.080]   was the big question. What about Pro systems? Surely a phone chip can't scale up. And that's
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:38.640]   been the funny thing about this week is like, it does. These are the first generation pro
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.240]   chips from Apple. These are not even iPhone 13s. These are 12s. Yes, these are based on the A14.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.360]   So they're the last previous year's chip cores. So that's the funny thing is that this is their
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.600]   first generation and they are supplying Pro power. Who knows how it's going to go and
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.840]   what pitfalls there might be. Nobody knows what is in that Mac Pro. Are they ever going to support
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.520]   external GPUs or is it only going to be Apple GPUs? There's still a lot of questions about the
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.640]   very high end. But you're talking about the tiniest slice of the market that there are questions about.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.840]   For most people, the single core M1 performance is enough for browsing, for email,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.120]   anything you're doing. And that's going to be exactly the same on a MacBook Air as it is going to be
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:27.040]   on a Mac Studio, right? Yeah, if you're just doing the basic work. But yeah, I mean, M1 is like,
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.120]   what is it? Six performance cores and two efficiency cores or something like that.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   And they power manage. And I think that's the truth. In fact, one of the problems with covering
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   something like a Mac Studio is you're already slicing the market real thin because this is a
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.040]   Pro Pro. Almost anything that anybody who would use a Mac would want to do outside of the Pro's
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:53.920]   can be handled by a 24 inch iMac or an M1 Mac Mini or an M1 Air. Like the M1 as basic as it is and
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.680]   it doesn't offer a lot of Pro features, you know, it's more than capable for the vast majority of
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.080]   people who use computers. But then there's the studio and the and the MacBook Pro for the higher
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.080]   end. And you know, there's people like us who maybe not I mean, Lisa for sure is never going to
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.440]   use the Ultra. I said, look at this, Lisa, you'll never see these cores pegged again. In however long
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.600]   she has that thing. She even though she's doing spreadsheets and stuff, it's never going to
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.400]   challenge that. Wait, wait, you gave her an Ultra? Yeah. She's she's my wife. No, I'm happy wife,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:33.360]   happy life. I am. No, lovely. And I know. Yeah. But I mean, just just give her the max and tell her
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.880]   it's the Ultra. You know, that is too much power. I have a woman to have an evil. I have an evil
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:46.320]   fight in my head that when my max comes, it looks exactly like I just swap it out. I might just sneak
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:52.240]   in in the middle of the night, sink the two, take the Ultra back and give her the max and she
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.920]   probably would never know. I'm gonna tell you one thing. You don't do it. You don't do it.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:03.360]   You don't do it. I'm gonna buy one. Mr. Ninja. If you don't swap them out, I will show up on
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   Sunday when you guys are in studio and I will swap it out. I had also ordered for her because I
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:15.680]   thought it should be she has a 49 inch curved display and she was using that with an iMac. We
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.120]   replaced it at 2014 iMac. So I got her, I thought at first, well, I'm just going to get a separate
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:28.000]   monitor and then I got her this studio display thinking and as soon as I saw, boy, the reviews
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.080]   from Neil I Patel on the Verge from Daring Fireballs John Gruber from Joanna Stern at the Wall Street
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.880]   Journal and on and on and on, this camera is awful even Michael Sargent who has the studio
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.200]   display. He said, my family, I used it to make a FaceTime call. They said, is there, is your camera
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.760]   smudged? Can you clean the camera? It was brand new out of the box. I canceled the display. I don't
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:59.280]   need for 1500 bucks and you even Jason helped because you tweeted a picture of your display crashing.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.520]   Yes, yes. Well, it didn't crash. It restarted after an error. That's a crash.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:12.160]   In Apple world, we don't call that a crash. Yeah, it's that display is hilarious. It is
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:21.120]   an iPhone. It is running iOS. It's an iPhone 11 running. I was 15.4. Yeah. The the the screen,
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.920]   like like my issues with it are the $400 adjustable stand because I think fundamentally
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.960]   display should be adjustable ergonomically. I think it's kind of outrageous. I ordered that for
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.560]   that. That's how I feel about that 24 inch iMac too is like you get this beautiful iMac in a
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.880]   cute color and then you put a dictionary under it. Not great. You should probably have it be
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.680]   adjustable. The webcam is weird because I didn't see the problems other people were seeing with it,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   which is why I think it is probably I think it's a bunch of things going on here. I think that a
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.720]   cropped widescreen 12 megapixel camera in different lighting can. It's cropped so it can do center
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.920]   stage. Yeah, it can be weird. But I think there are also some image processing things happening
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.440]   that depending on your lighting conditions. Apple says we're going to update this a bit better.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:12.480]   Because I did a 90 minute actually talking about the embargo a 90 minute live video on YouTube
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.440]   after the embargo dropped with Dan Morin. We did it for six colors and I spent the entire
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:23.360]   show on the webcam. Nobody noticed. And it looks good. Nobody said oh that's good. So I don't know
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.120]   what's going on there and I've got to think that there are software problems which keep in mind
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.880]   will require an iOS update apparently in order to fix them. But there are some software problems
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.840]   that are making it in certain lighting conditions. I don't think it's a hardware problem. It's
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.920]   possible. I just got a good one. But my guess is that something really bad happened in their
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.080]   image processing pipeline and it made it all look bad. Why didn't they notice that before they
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.840]   shipped it? I don't know. I wonder if it was a different version that was on the on the displays
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.320]   that they were shipping. It's it is one of the weirdest things that's happened to me in 25 years
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.880]   of running about technology because I got a heads up from one of my fellow embargo reviewers that
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.840]   there was a problem with a webcam. And so I got to spend time trying to duplicate it and I
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.960]   couldn't do it. Maybe there's too much light coming into my office. I have a well lit office. I don't
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.400]   know what's going on. I grew up even at problem center stage. He was like he's posted a picture
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.160]   where he's off center stage. Off center stage. I we I did duplicate that. That's that's a problem
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   where center stage just sort of hangs around and you're not in the center and eventually you're in
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.080]   the center. It's in the iPads. I think it's in the MacBooks where it centers you the camera. So it's
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.800]   here in clever. It's a it's a real wide camera and then they use machine learning to detect faces
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.040]   and automatically kind of zoom and pan the camera to match when it works. A portal does this and
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.920]   does it better. No the Facebook portal does it. Yes. And it does it. It does it very well. So I
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.880]   my as much as I just said they're magical. How come they just don't they can't care about webcams
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.680]   because they keep putting these things. All these what they don't care. So this laptop has a very
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:01.280]   thin screen but you have an inch and a half. Yeah. There's plenty of room in the studio display
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.080]   to put a good camera in there. Yes. By the way the crash message this I don't want to see a crash
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.520]   on my on my monitor. Plus it's got a bit it's thick and square and it's got a big fan on it.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   You know when they said they're i13 bionics in it. I scratched my head. Mark Gurman was on
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.000]   Mac break weekly on Tuesday. He said these displays were designed two years ago. That's why
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.320]   they're kind of they don't have HDR. They're not great displays. They're LG panels probably but
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:35.520]   only 600 nits. He says that's why it's the a 13. That was the generation of iPhone two years ago.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.640]   And my conjecture and he kind of agreed is they had extra chips. Why not. There is so much going
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   on with apples products right now that is recycling. You can see it like they are one of the ways
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.920]   and they make it up in volume. One of the ways it works is they keep using the same stuff. So
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.040]   the camera in this and this is the argument I think about the the studio display that's interesting
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.440]   is did they get carried away because they like center stage so much and they're like well we'll
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.320]   just use the exact same hardware in every single device that has center stage. So it's the same
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.560]   camera and spatial audio right it's all right right right all of the all of the microphone stuff
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:21.040]   sounds very much like what's in JJ's MacBook Pro. The speakers they say they're better but they're
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   very much the same engineering. They're reusing so many of the parts because I mean the truth is
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.120]   they are only one company and how do you handle it if you are going your own and building all your
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:38.880]   own stuff is you got to reuse it right. So I canceled it. I had an LG HDR 120 hertz display.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.040]   No I guess it's only 60 hertz so it wasn't that bad but she's just released a spreadsheet she
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.760]   isn't 120 hertz spreadsheets that I'd already bought I brought a Brio camera because I didn't
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.360]   know Apple was going to do this I canceled the display and I said well just usually we already
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.320]   have it's fine. The only thing she doesn't have is those nice speakers and they sound good right.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.640]   No no that was actually I all these people complaining about the webcam and I'm like guys I had no
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.520]   problem with the webcam. The speakers are okay for speakers that are embedded in a little display
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.640]   but that's it that that's there they're interesting you don't want to listen to music on them right.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.200]   So do they sound as good as the iMac? I didn't think they sounded as good as the iMac Pro
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.040]   which is maybe the iMac Pro has better speakers than the regular iMac.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.800]   It's a really weird thing to skimp on. I well I think especially if you're selling it.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.240]   I think they're as good as you can get in that space in a monitor but they're not a
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.800]   then they oversell it and they say oh this is all studio quality and I think that's the problem.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.480]   However I will say Mac users have wanted an Apple external display for years and this thing is
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.080]   going to sell. It's really well because there's so many people with MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.640]   who their only real option at Apple's Retina resolution has been the LG Ultrafine and this is
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   the same panel more or less just a little bit brighter. That's what I bought for $650.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.560]   Yeah LG Ultrafine is $4k and that's fine. The only monitor that got me excited is the Samsung
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.960]   Arc. If you'd like to buy two of those and some of those are nice. This is that new one that goes up
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.640]   as well as out right? You can get us one. I mean why would you that is the weirdest so is the idea
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.080]   that you're playing a game and you're tilled back? So the first thing you live in a cave your computer
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.000]   is your cave. So the first thing I don't understand and general why I'm probably just going to get
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.880]   one just so I can see is they show you the display with uh you have sections you have your gaming
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.960]   and you can see your webcam and it's arked in front of you right but I'm like how is my webcam
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.760]   deadpan center shooting when I'm looking at this monitor? How is there how is that possible? It's
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.160]   not possible but that's why you spend money and buy things because the marketing looks good and I
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.320]   feel like I should have it. They got us. They should definitely get us one my birthday Christmas.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.560]   What's it called again? The Samsung Arc. Arc let me just see if I can uh how much is it?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.480]   Is it? Have they announced? Uh like eight million dollars. I don't know how much it is.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.800]   It's one of those if you if you don't ask you haven't if you have to ask. Yeah it's too expensive.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.360]   Yeah. Oh all right. Oh my god. There's a beautiful seat right there. Yeah yeah no I know what it
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.560]   looks like. I'm trying to show the people at home. Yeah so oh that looks like a walking case of next
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.640]   right now. You can flip it and you can also it just becomes a wider screen when you turn it.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.680]   Because guess what? You don't want to do $4. Wow. You don't want to do $4. It comes with a stand though.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.360]   You can rotate it. You can rotate it. How much is it? Well we don't know. We don't know.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.440]   It might be more than $4. If it's less than 1500 we're still winning.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   It's not less than 1500. That is not a modern. When you say like that that means you won't buy
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.920]   it for me for Christmas. We gotta just negotiate you know. We low ball the price. We just have
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.640]   an order. We show them the bill two months later. But that that's impressive to me. That's something
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.480]   new and I'm excited to check that out. It's new. I mean you can say that. It's different. Yeah it's
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.960]   new. Uh all right. You you reviewed the M1 iPad. You also have uh that the new iPad here. You like
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.600]   it? Yeah it's it's talking about recycling. This is another part of that story. In fact I recycled
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:06.400]   parts of my reviews of the M1. Very handy. Very handy. And the old iPad Air because it really
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.320]   there's nothing new on that product. It was kind of my thought is that if you already have an iPad
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:16.640]   Pro this is the iPad Pro kind of. It's well it's the iPad Pro without the true motion without
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.160]   Pro motion and without the the mini LED display on the high end and without Thunderbolt which nobody
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.920]   really uses. But it is it is you know last year or two years ago they did the new iPad Air with the
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.640]   flat sides and it was a lot like the iPad Pro. This is just that with a couple small upgrades
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.840]   because they're they put center stage in it. So that same camera is in there. And M1.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:43.680]   There's they're the last hold out of enlightening. Do you think this year? I don't know. I don't know
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.760]   whether they'll ever do it. We'll see. So annoying. That making too much money for the
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.400]   dongle life. Surely. I mean it's just you know. They also got I mean they really got yelled at when
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.160]   they went away from the last standard connector. And I'm not sure whether they want to do it. I
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.520]   wonder if there are still people inside Apple who are like no no. The next port is no port.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.360]   We'll just do mag safe for everything. We'd heard that rumor or maybe they'd
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.240]   go pins on the back. It would be nice if lightning went away every time I have to find a lightning
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.160]   plug for my trackpad. I think. Oh right. Lightning still on the trackpad still on the mouse.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.880]   And people would get mad now because the whole world is on USB C. Yes. Before people are upset
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   because there are four different versions that you could be using. Now it's USB C and lightning
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.560]   and that's really it's every device. So it's over. So they might as well switch it over.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.040]   And there better always be a port on this phone or tick tockers will lose their mind.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.240]   How am I going to get my pro audio with Bluetooth and sync up my voice if you don't keep a plug in
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.880]   this bad boy. Bugs for life. I agree with you. I think that my my fear is that Apple has people
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.840]   inside who are like no man you don't understand. They have. We're going to have a magnetic smart
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.240]   connector for people who need it and everything else will be wireless. And this is the same story
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.640]   that they've told about all sorts of other things. And you know losing the headphone jack we all
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:08.880]   got through that. But losing losing a wired wired access to a device is a bad place to go. It's a
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.800]   bad place to go for lots of reasons including like the high quality audio or if it bricks or I mean
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.520]   there's so many reasons to keep some support on the device. And just power if I'm out and we're
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.960]   going to put pogo pins in the back. I go to somebody for 59.99 you'll be able to buy a little
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.640]   canal lightning connector that pogo pins onto the back and you're and you'll be right back up
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.120]   with the rest of us. By that time I'll be as old as you and it won't matter to me anymore.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.080]   Nothing matters to me anymore. Exactly. That's my point once once you reassert
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.760]   nage you're just like fluffing nothing. I'm basically feigning interest in this whole thing. I can't
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.720]   realize. When you get your wife a super computer for a spreadsheet I could say that you're at the
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:58.160]   peak essence of whatever. And how's your wife? Well I don't have one. Because I couldn't buy
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.880]   an ultra with a straight face. That's why. No I think that there are times one just says and I said
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.720]   it several times now she's probably getting sick of hearing it. Honey you have the best
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.760]   Mac Apple as ever made. And you know you know it's funny. Is that right? And you know it's honey?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.440]   And since she knows that you love her that much that's why she has the black card and you do not.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.600]   Yeah that's right. Although I could have used her black card. It would have been nice.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.360]   Let's take a little break. It's nice to everybody in studio. One of the things you lose
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.920]   people always say on the phone you know the shows where we're all on Zoom or whatever that we
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.960]   all step all over each other. Yeah. And it's not because you get the somehow it's going through the
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.240]   area I'm going to talk. You don't have that problem. There's no latency. The not even latency
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:48.080]   it's just that when I'm at home I see main camera Jason speaking and I'm waiting for him to stop and
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.040]   I don't know that Ian's also waiting. Yeah. And then we both Jason finished and we both jump in.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.080]   So being able to look each other in the eye does make for a much better flow. It is amazing just
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.720]   having not done this in a while. How much body language just the eyes the mouth like everybody
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.840]   who's leaning in who's ready to go. I'm going to back off. Yeah. It's incredible. Yeah. Power of
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:15.120]   people. Let's play these bills on the list. Oh and JJ Stone. Oh doctor is here from iqmz.com from
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.760]   the register.com. Of course the great Ian Thompson not Lane Ian. Let's get that straight.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.680]   Why do you think the lower third said Lane? Was it an old one or was it was a joke?
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.760]   Oh god. I was being wound up. I was being wound up. And Jason style six colors dot
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.720]   com is so nice to have all three of you here. So much fun. I'm going to take you out to dinner
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   after this. How about that? Okay. If you tell Lisa that that Ultra is not what she needs.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:53.520]   I'm going to tell her so much that she trades it with my max that way because I ordered an
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.360]   Ultra but I'm going to order a max just like I have two oatres. I'm just going to swap it out.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.040]   As cunning plans go announcing it on the show is possibly probably she's watching.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.360]   Oh no she's not. You know I know she went to see the Batman. Oh yeah.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:15.120]   He's stuck there forever. Nobody tell her. She's going to come out talking like this.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:22.720]   Our show today brought to you by Zipp recruiter hiring his back. The world is coming back.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.160]   And you know what's great? Employers 90% of them are really thinking how do we make
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.840]   employee experience a top priority this year. You know make them want to come back. Make it
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   worth their while. And the good news is people are employers are learning. We just started doing
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.880]   four day work week. Employees love that. Right. Listening to your employees. Making them feel
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.920]   valued. Ask them questions. Questions letting them have input focusing on the company culture.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.680]   Some companies cultures are not so good. Especially in the gaming industry. So we're going to make

[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.560]   Do this. You're going to come slash something. Yes.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:27.600]   It's the world as independent podcasters is slowly constricting as Spotify and Apple and Amazon
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.280]   and iHeart buy up everything including all the ad metrics and everything it's going to get harder
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   and harder and harder. So whether it's Owens you know IQMZ podcasts like yeah I have a different
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   way of receiving funds I use my shows for as leverage you just you don't beg no you command.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.120]   No I'm I'm I'm a person who markets other people so I hate marketing for myself.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   I do too. I have you know what I had 5,000 people in my email. But you're a marketer.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.840]   Yeah I have 5,000 people on email. I've never sent them one email. Yeah.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.440]   So I finally used them last week and I reached out and I'm like good 3,000 on the set something.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.760]   Oh no it's so you're still live. You're out there. So you got to reach out to the people and the
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.120]   people will help you out. You know you've built a little empire here. You know we're still in the
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.680]   point of the country. Support the podcasters they like whether it's Jason or Owen you know and
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.000]   do you do a podcast here? We don't know. Why does the register do a podcast?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.600]   Because to be quite frank we've been trying to hire people and and finding good journalists is
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.840]   is tough to do and that's really our priority. We've just-
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.800]   Everyone's a journalist now. Sorry. I just say we're a straight face. If you wanted to zoom I would
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.560]   have missed that. I would have been sad. It would have been a problem yes.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.720]   But yes it's um no and we've just doubled the size of the of the US office but yeah it's it's on the
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.760]   it's on the list of things to do. Yeah. But you know it's like primarily we want you know people
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:57.360]   who are writing and it's a hard time for content in general. It's going to be worse when the
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.840]   cookies thing kicks in next year. Don't get me started on the cookies thing. This cookies banner
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.960]   by itself is becoming the biggest hazard on the internet. They're getting bigger and bigger and
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.160]   going to a lot of sites now. You cannot read any content. Used to be you could ignore it. Yeah.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.280]   You can't even ignore it now. You have to respond to it and there's options and and who does that
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.560]   benefit? It doesn't make it more private. I really would like to know who it benefits because it's
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.400]   it's a scourge upon the internet. It's a scourge. Especially not for nothing.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:35.200]   Most media and content is consumed on my phone. So even just the fact that I got to sometimes
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.600]   pinch in to get to an ex. If I wanted to ex it out I can't even because my you know I got
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   chunky fingers. I can't even like get to it. I have to accept because the accept is the only thing in
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.080]   the big blue button that you can get in that finite window space. So it's very annoying.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.400]   I'm finding that with a lot of a lot of titles. It's getting it's getting increasingly out of
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.560]   control. And I know you know I disagreeed about this and I don't mind the cookie screen so
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.240]   so often because you can at least check and see what kind of stuff they're taking.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.000]   But it's just got out of control. I mean it this really needs to be reined in.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.320]   What's going to happen is people are going to start running blockers. They're running ad blockers
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.080]   already. They're going to run. I mean it's easy to block that cookie banner. You block
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:21.280]   origin as a switch to do it. And you make this enough of an annoyance pretty soon it gets ignored
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.360]   completely. Yeah I use a plug in called super agent. Yeah. And it is the automatically accept and
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.400]   get it out of my face. Yeah. Which is going against the entire principle of that pop up. But it's just
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:38.320]   an annoyance. And I don't want to ever see it ever. And anybody in California gets to see it now.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.440]   Oh yeah. Like all the people in Europe is to see it now. Everybody in California gets to see it.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.960]   That's why it's gotten worse. Yeah. That's why California has a Europe like law about cookie consent.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   Yes. Oh great. Hooray. We sold it. Right. Fixed privacy. I feel kind of guilty. You know the
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.400]   you actually pushed this on and that California has adopted it. But you know needs must. We didn't
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.680]   talk. I don't want to go back to the Apple conversation because people are going to think
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:08.960]   it's an all Apple show. It's not. But I should mention this universal control is out now with iOS 15.4.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.480]   I cannot get it working on one of my iPads. It works on my mini but not on my M1. I don't know why.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:20.160]   Tried it in a hundred different ways. People who use it say it's very cool. It's not like Sidecar.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   It doesn't. It's not a second monitor. It's actually you have. Or duet. It's not like that
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.760]   because your iPad is still an iPad. Yeah. You can run iPad apps. That's the most
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:36.480]   important with your mouse. I never use Sidecar because I would always put an app over there
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.160]   that I had an iPad app of. And I'd be like well why not run the iPad app. So I'll discord running
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.680]   over there or I see. Exactly. And it's the version that runs on iOS. But you can just move your
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.920]   mouse over there and control it. One of the things I often am doing is running YouTube videos while
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.560]   I'm coding or learning something at the same time. And it's nice to have a little screen there
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.520]   that I can watch the video on. So really? Yeah. I mean it's look you can still touch it. It's not
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.000]   like it's not like it's adding a huge amount of functionality. But you know, it's that's how I
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.600]   convince myself that I didn't need Apple's monitor at all because I said to myself I've got the 12.9
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:19.680]   M1 iPad Pro. Really nice. So that display is phenomenal. Yeah. Do a lot. Like I double better
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.520]   than the studio display. Yeah. And I double check a lot of work and reference work on it. So I'm
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:30.320]   like, all right, I can keep my 47 inch monitor and my TV monitor and just use the pro as my
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   official Apple display to check everything. Nice. My colors of race. But you are running 16 inch
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:41.760]   Macbook Pro, which is a Frisbee. It's gone. My iPad pros in my bag. But this is this is already
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.320]   sold. This is going away. Is that an I nine or is that a M1? This is the M1. You're getting rid of
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:52.240]   it. Yeah, a max. I've had it for three more days before I could have returned to that the store.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.840]   So now I'm going to sell it almost at full price. It's the same difference. I'm going to be very
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.040]   happy with this thing. Okay. And it's a great machine. It's just that it's not a studio. I was
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.360]   going to get I'm glad I didn't. I was going to get that for my son who's a ticktocker. Yeah. And I
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.520]   think I'll just I already ordered him a Mac studio because I think that'll be a perfect thing for his
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.800]   videos to tell you to you might as well get him the laptop because he's cooking and making food
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.960]   on the go. He could be out here mixing them. Well, he'll keep the laptop that he's got. He's got a
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.280]   nine nine. He keep that. But he'll do a lot of the editing. I think he'll be faster for him. Get him
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.560]   an M one. Yeah, I think so. And he's got two million followers in TikTok now. Did you see that?
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.680]   By the time I come back, it'll be six months. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. He's going to be
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.920]   his is going to be on access Hollywood teaching Mario Lopez how to make a McRib sandwich. I think
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:47.760]   this week or the next that Caribbean pesto is the jam. That's impressive. It's good. It's good. I
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.800]   know how I now know how Frank Sinatra felt. I now know how Donald Trump feels when the junior
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:07.520]   exceeds the senior. Speaking of nothing, this deep fake, did you see this of Zielinski saying
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:14.640]   surrender is kind of terrifying. I don't think it fools anybody. No, this was posted on Facebook
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   course. They pulled it down immediately. I don't speak Ukrainian, but this is a deep fake of the
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:28.320]   president of Ukraine telling his soldiers to surrender. It's over. I hope it didn't work. I think
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:36.320]   it's obviously yes. I think people clocked on to it very quickly and also they got the news out fast.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:43.040]   But yeah, I mean, if you're if you don't have access to an open media to open media and you're
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.080]   living in Russia and you only got state sponsored stuff and they showed that it's a nice try. Yeah,
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.720]   it's a nice try. And I worry this is the beginning, right? We're going to see a lot more of this kind
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.080]   of thing. This is this is definitely going to be a doing thing. Oh, and if you look at that,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.600]   can you tell it's a deep fake? So I guess his voice sounds a little let me play the audio.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.800]   The real problem is whether you recognize it quickly in your mind or in your eyesight. We're at
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.320]   the level now within two more years, you won't know the difference. Right? Yeah. There's so many
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.760]   things where people send me something and I'm like, that's photoshopped. And they're like, no,
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.680]   it's not. You run it through something that you could tell because at this point, telling me
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.600]   something's photoshopped or not, unless you put a shark on my head and it looks ridiculous,
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.560]   it's really hard to know. The skill level is so advanced. And now we've gotten to this level,
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.080]   we're now even the audio. So imagine you don't even need to see that this even the setup of that
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.720]   makes you question the legitimacy of it, the background, raw kind of stuff, instantly makes
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.920]   you around like, oh, no, but imagine just being on an open broadcast radio and hearing a message
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.120]   go out over the radio in Barack Obama's voice. Right. I don't care in your middle of the closet,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.360]   in the dark, with no sun, you hear that voice, you know exactly what it is. So to hear a certain
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.080]   message come out and it's very easy to do audio. Yes. Now very incredible audio. And two years,
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.040]   it's really going to become a product. I'm not actually here because I didn't really want to
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.960]   be in studio. So I'm a clone. Avatar, Glee avatar.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.560]   Yeah. If I want to be optimistic, what I'll say is that I hope that our media literacy
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:19.280]   means that there is a limited window where this stuff will work. And if we work really hard,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.240]   we can make that window as small as possible. It's a bit of a race though.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.080]   It is a race and the people who are going to do bad deeds are going to be the ones who can find
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.880]   a way to slide in there before our defenses go up. But I do think people are learning
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.160]   about things that are fake. And the deep fake is a great example where a couple of years ago,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.240]   everybody would have been like, oh my god. And now they're like, oh yeah, I saw that thing
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:46.320]   with Tom Cruise deep faked. And they start to get it and we start to have to build in another
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.040]   level where everything like I've been noticing that a lot of organizations like Bellingcat are
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:58.640]   doing verification of videos in Ukraine of attacks on video or reports or anything like that.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:04.560]   And that becomes like an important part of journalism is the validation of what we see.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.800]   Did that really happen? And that's great. Like, I know that it's terrible that this is going on
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.880]   and that there are going to be places where people get misled. But if I have any optimism
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.880]   about it, it's that it looks like we're trying to build up some structures to teach people
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:26.000]   that they can't just trust it when they see it. But it's so hard because it's human nature to just
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.400]   trust that voice or that face that you know so well. And to human nature, was that what you said?
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.440]   That's also the saddest part of what goes on right now in the world. I show someone a picture of a
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:40.080]   or video of a cat falling off a tree that's staged. That's not real. It's not instantly. And I bet
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:46.560]   Leah, your daughter does that faster than anybody, right? Anyone under 24, you send them something
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.840]   and it's like, oh, they did that for jokes. You're already conditioned not to believe in
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:58.960]   spontaneity in genuine, you're raised and hard. It does. Like you said, we're we're naturally
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:05.760]   as humans adjusting to, okay, well, CGI, not real fake. Yeah, I mean, staged. There's also a
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.120]   tech fix here to be had because there's been a lot of interesting work. We're using AI systems to
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:17.520]   spot these kind of things and to build up fingerprints of them and just make it a lot easier to you
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.040]   know, if you see a video just to have a little button by the side of it saying we believe that
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.000]   it's his fate would solve an awful lot of the issues. Yeah. Well, doesn't Facebook do that now?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.880]   Oh, with some things, but it's not exactly 100%. But then you're automatically applying your AI
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   to it, which they a lot of that's not being done automatically, but it can be done, right?
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.360]   Where you apply some AI to the video and you say this can't be real for lighting isn't, you know,
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:45.200]   there are the pixels aren't right. Like analysis, the human eyes can't see. There's another side
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.240]   effect of this, which is something that I think the Russians have been putting forward for at least
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:57.840]   five years, which is don't trust anything. So if it undermines your sense of anything being true,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.480]   that is also very detrimental. That's destructive as well. If you have no source of truth at all.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.120]   Although one of the things that's been happening in the run up to this war, especially,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:16.080]   is the approach by NATO and especially like the US intelligence committee or community has been
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.840]   wasn't that smart of them to to inoculate this. Yeah, they kept saying here is what Russia is doing.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.640]   Here's what they're going to do. Right. They are going to invade. Yeah.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.520]   And personally, no, we're not going to invade and then they invade and they're like, well,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.040]   here's what they're going to do. They are now starting to claim that there are chemical weapons
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.160]   depots. That's because they're planning chemical attempts. And that is a isn't that smart, a new
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.040]   use of intelligence to where they're trying to be basically transparent and say, we're going to just
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:46.480]   say everything we think is going to happen because it makes it harder for the other side to play the
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.880]   game. But even that was an uphill battle because I saw people saying, oh, yeah, just like you said,
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:57.600]   yellow cake, it was a problem in Iraq and let's invade. We have a historic distrust of our intelligence
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.000]   committee. But the more they do this and are proven right, which they have been, the better.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   And I thought that was a very interesting strategy. Right. It would not to let us against
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.520]   disinformation by saying, here's what they're going to tell you. Yeah, I mentioned using information
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.080]   to counteract disinformation. Very smart. But very traditional. I mean, Russia
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:20.560]   pretty much invented the whole concept of disinformation under the communists and they do it very well.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.120]   Masters of it. But yeah, as they were saying, start, they're going to hold a false flag operation.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.760]   That'll lead off with the invasion and that sort of thing. And yes, it does draw their fangs
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   somewhat. So what's the deal with Tulsi Gabbard? Because she was the one who's spreading that.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.040]   Russian propaganda. It's kind of interesting. Yeah. I don't think we can legally suggest that
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:44.880]   she's a Russian asset. But who knows? I mean, that was an interesting thing.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.240]   Speaking of mistakes, you want to check your email. Very important. Check your email.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.080]   It's a great story. Telegram didn't check its email. And now it's banned in Brazil.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.920]   Whoops. It says the verge. This is an article from Mitchell Clock.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:09.680]   Pavel Dorov was the CEO and founder of Telegram. Okay. So Brazil says, we sent a takedown request
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:16.320]   to Telegram saying, you know, if you don't take this down, we're going to ban you. We're going to
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.720]   suspend the app in Brazil. By the way, it seems like the Brazilian Supreme Court has a thing about
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.320]   doing this. Remember they tried to do with WhatsApp and there was practically a revolution.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.720]   Well, what's what's happened is the backbone of Brazil? Yes. I think they can get away with it
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   with Telegram because it's not quite so popular. It's not. So Dorov put out a statement saying,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.280]   it seems we had an issue with emails going between our Telegram corporate addresses in the Brazilian
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   Supreme Court. From now on, we're going to have a dedicated email address for takedowns.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:53.760]   The court sent it to an old general purpose email address and we never saw it. And sorry, guys.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.840]   That's hilarious. It's weird to technically be a possible thing.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.960]   I mean, I don't know startups and companies that grow out of startups often have
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.360]   are so disorganized. I miss emails all the time. I can understand that. And they have like,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.000]   they don't. We have many addresses. And they didn't have somebody who's paying attention to
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.440]   Brazil or they had an old email somewhere. Yeah. The person was checking that.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:26.000]   It was in the spam folder, right? Too many links. Yep. Probably was fishing. That's a good answer.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.440]   Probably too many. Brazil. Yeah. Too many links. Brazil.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.680]   Yeah. Brazil is this the Brazil.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:38.880]   Dorov brought on behalf of the team. I apologize to the Brazilian Supreme Court for our negligence.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:45.440]   We definitely could have done a better job. You think? It's just good grief. It's one I want.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:53.760]   And also, to be fair, Telegram was dealing with other issues, particularly in Russia.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.160]   They maybe had a lot of people answering those emails. There might have been some other stuff
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:04.320]   going on. So I hope that they're able to, apparently, tens of millions of Brazilians use Telegram,
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.720]   according to Dorov. Check your email. Check your spam.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:15.920]   All those people most likely signed up when WhatsApp went down. You're right. You're right.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.800]   Because that literally shut down three quarters of the world. People don't realize,
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.280]   "Oh, my Instagram's messed up. Who cares about your Instagram?" This is the only time I can talk to
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.440]   my sister about ordering fish for our restaurant, like businesses run on WhatsApp and certain places
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.520]   in the world. So I'm sure they got a boost when it went down. That's why everybody's like, "Oh,
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.320]   on Telegram, that's not--" Telegram got a real bump rumor when--
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:43.360]   Yeah, that's something a lot. Facebook or WhatsApp changed its policies.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.280]   Policies and everybody signed up for Telegram. That was a huge--
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:51.200]   Telegram has the most specific encryption and privacy policy.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   Telegram is not a good encryption. I wouldn't rely on Telegram.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:00.880]   They have a guy in Brazil now, though. They've made that promise. We got a guy.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.200]   Don't you hate to be that guy? I mean, that's what Russia and China both said.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.480]   You got to have an office in country. So we know who to throw in jail, if you don't comply with
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.040]   our requests. Who volunteers for that job? Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.960]   I would volunteer for that job. You know how many MacBooks I can buy with the hazard pay?
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.200]   Sign me up. Sign me up. You need a lot of good in Siberia, dude.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.520]   Look, look, trust me, it'll be negotiated. It'll be worth it.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:33.920]   Get me out of the Gulag. I'll be deleting everything. I'll be checking every email.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.720]   I won't-- I'll sleep with one I open. I'm checking every email.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   Nothing's getting past me for the right price.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.560]   You see, when it comes to messaging, signal all the way in Moxie, you trust.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.800]   And then, you know-- I agree. There you go. 100%.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.200]   Although he no longer runs Signal. Does that matter?
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.120]   True. No, but I mean, he's got a good team there.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:51.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:58.320]   And they're very much on side. The exposure he did of the Saudi Arabian government was just hilarious
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.200]   when they approached him to build a surveillance network. He was like, "Oh, I tell me more.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.800]   Tell me what exactly you look for. I'm on my mind." They published everything.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.400]   And it was just like, "Woops."
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.200]   "Red dot." Yeah, somebody's getting fired in React.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:18.800]   Vimeo, another email you might want to not ignore, is sending out big bills to content creators
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:25.840]   because apparently they changed their deal. They want everybody to know that Vimeo is not an
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:33.440]   indie YouTube. We are not a place to put your videos. We are for business, B2B.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.920]   And so a number of content creators got thousand of dollar bills if they want,
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.680]   pay up or get off our platform.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:47.440]   They're going to get off the platform. And it's sad because I understand the premise of what they're
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:54.480]   doing. And Vimeo is, if you wanted to be elegant and if you wanted to eat at an Italian restaurant
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.960]   set of McDonald's, YouTube is McDonald's. There's one in every corner. It's out there.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.160]   Vimeo is like, "I'm a professional. I have a real. I want a clean player. I don't want you
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.320]   clicking into some kid getting hit or back and head with a woofle bat or anything crazy.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.360]   I just want to display my work." Do you have any Vimeo videos?
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.840]   I do. It's for client work. So it's private.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.280]   And that's how they want it to be.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.880]   Yes. But again, even if I say I'm semi-popular and I wanted to have a real,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.960]   let's say I'm an actor and I'm sending my real out to places and it happens to get out or
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:30.400]   something, a sketch that I have and it happens to get popular. Great for me, bad for me because
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.040]   hey, look, I'm still just this indie guy trying to put something out there and it caught a wave,
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.120]   which is great. But now I get this bill and guess what? It didn't get picked up by a studio,
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:46.240]   guys. I don't have this money to do it. So it's a weird balance. But again, Vimeo has a very clean,
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.120]   beautiful player and it doesn't bring you outside of the house. So those bills are just rough for
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:56.080]   some people that are using the service, can't foot the bill. When the Verge exposed this,
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.440]   Vimeo realized this wasn't very good PR. So they have actually changed it. You have two terabytes.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.200]   It was such a weasel word stay when they just say, obviously we would like to
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:13.120]   support our customers anyway, possible. Yeah, you got cool. Let's not overdo this.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.520]   Yeah, but that would be a scary email to get. Oh, you owe us $3,500 for the next year if you
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:23.920]   want to keep your videos. And again, for a working professional that, for a smaller business or
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.400]   something like that, that's a pretty hefty bill for something that you're using that is
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.160]   could be the backbone of what you're trying to put out and produce a lot of restaurants and
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.960]   stuff, use it for things like that. So again, the volume versus what you might get on a holiday
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.920]   season, it's just weird. But they backtrack, they fix it up. So we're good now.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:50.400]   Vimeo is owned by a big Hollywood agency, Barry Diller's IAC. So I wouldn't expect them to be
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:58.320]   altruistic and all nice in here. Story of videos here. And to be fair, it's not free to host the
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.000]   quality videos that are being put up on Vimeo either. Well, you don't set the stage though as
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.120]   YouTube is giving it away. What's you know, YouTube is amazing. Like I said, McDonald's. Yeah,
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.960]   they're global there on every corner. They've got the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the advertising.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.560]   That's the other thing too. This is nice about Vimeo. Like I'm not getting spammed by
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.240]   soccer ads and other things. Like I'm just there to consume for your use. It's the right place
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.360]   for certain things for certain things. But we still post on YouTube for mass appeal.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.400]   Yes. Yeah. Like I said, I can't say enough. Yeah. Free is free is for me. And they want like,
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.480]   you can put it like three day movies now. Like I remember when YouTube you had like two minutes,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.600]   then it went to 10 minutes. So we lost our lives allowing you to put a half an hour up. That's right.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.240]   Is that good or bad? That is great. I think who wants to watch a half hour TikTok?
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   Well, first of all, when it gets to be a half an hour, it's no longer a TikTok. It's a podcast.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   Once they hit 10 minutes, it wasn't TikTok anymore. Because in general, as a rant here myself,
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   it's hard to consume anymore than two minutes at a time with someone blabbing about what.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.760]   Swipe up, swipe up, swipe up. But you get 10 minutes in there. You can have an hour there.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.720]   Now I can do a half of a power hour. I can have a video game in session. We can do all kinds of
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.440]   fun stuff in 30 minutes on the TikToks. Have you looked at the Amazon AMP platform? That's their
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.560]   new clubhouse, basically. But they have a deal with all the record labels so you can put in
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.760]   music. That's very interesting to me. And you could DJ it and you could take calls.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.680]   That's kind of interesting. We did it on Wednesday. I did a pre-show for this week in Google. I got
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.440]   a whole listener. It was so exciting. Well, so that was going to be my statement to why I
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.040]   haven't really tried it. Because everything, if I've mentioned anything of Amazon product to
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.720]   someone, they look at me like I'm trying to beat them and rob them. Hey, have you watched such and
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.120]   such? Oh, where's that? On Amazon Prime. Now they have Amazon. They have Amazon Prime. Everybody
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.320]   has it. But they don't want to. They refuse to go to it. Like this show is amazing. Okay, no.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:04.640]   My daughter said I asked my daughter, we have Apple Music and we have Spotify. And I'm like,
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.280]   we don't need all that. I was like, can you talk your mom into paying for Spotify? And so I can
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.920]   have Apple. You can have both. And so she says to me, she's like, no, because mom uses Amazon
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.720]   Music. And we both looked at each other like, and I know better. And I still did it. And I'm
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.760]   like, your mom's using that. You know what? Amazon is free. And it's what she pays for. And she does.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.640]   But again, in my mind, I'm like Amazon Music. And I forgot. I have it. It's free to me. I've
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.200]   never turned it on. I remember. I thought of pressing the button. So it's kind of interesting.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.120]   It's very interesting. The way that the Amazon, a bad brand name? It's not
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.400]   Amazon. They're the yin and yang of the universe. Everyone hates them, but they need them. It's
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.560]   like saying Walmart. And they're, yeah, nobody wanted Walmart music and their products. Like I
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.800]   said, like I watch a lot of their premium content on shows, but it took me a minute to get into it.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.120]   And now that I'm into it, I pop it on like once a month, find something new, great, cool. It's not
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.840]   Netflix yet. But when you tell another person, even though they have it, general people don't want
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.480]   to touch their insulin. Yeah, where do I put my photos? Hey, you have a prime account, right?
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.520]   Just move it there. Everyone so upset about Google saying they're going to chart and say,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.760]   well, you got prime prime. I'm not giving Amazon my photos. I'm not doing that. I'm like, but you
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.680]   did it for Google. Like you trust Google. Yeah, but you don't. I might get free to you. I'm trying
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.640]   to give you the free option because that's what you want. But that's the mindset from, I feel from
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.520]   general public about Amazon products besides Amazon. So speaking of clubhouse, apparently Putin forgot
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.480]   to shut the door on clubhouse. He's closed down. It's plenty of funds to use for it. Yeah, I mean,
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.560]   you shouldn't say this out loud, but I don't think Putin's watching Twitter. No,
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.320]   doesn't. Okay, maybe one of his apparat chicks is keeping an eye on us.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:52.080]   Russians have blocked Instagram, Twitter, Facebook. TikTok was spent suspended services in Russia
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:05:00.640]   because of the quote, fake news law. Telegram says we're not going to give any user data over,
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:07.200]   so it's widely used. And apparently nobody knew about clubhouse. So clubhouse is now a great place
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:14.000]   for Russians to go to share their dislike of the war. So I think it's kind of interesting. I don't
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.440]   know. I haven't used clubhouse in a long time, but clubhouse is a weird party. Like when I check in,
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:26.640]   yeah, like it's I think it's because of who I follow. It's either NFTs or it was too much Bitcoin
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.240]   broke for me. And that's why I stopped doing it. Or like the groups are very finite. So
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.480]   sometimes I've stumbled into like women's groups and I'm like, am I allowed to be here? Can I listen?
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.640]   I won't say anything. I just want to listen and find out what's going on. So if you made your
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.680]   handle, Oh, we know you could go in. I could definitely do it. Yeah, I could definitely do
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.240]   that. I just wasn't about a bun you phone just so I could use it because it's just clubhouse.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.560]   Yeah. Well, so this is what I think interesting about clubhouse. It continues on, even though
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.720]   it's not the flavor of the month anymore. But it is a great place for an affinity group to go.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:03.920]   Yeah. And so Russians have discovered this is a way that they can freely talk about the war.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   And they in fact, there are apparently hundreds and hundreds of channels now of any war sentiment
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.360]   in clubhouse. It's good they can find community and have messaging because that's the one thing,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.560]   again, thankfully for us being in America, we haven't had wars in our shore. But when people
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.160]   don't understand is that even on any side of conflict, there are people inside that conflict
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.560]   that do not agree with what the leaders are doing. So for them to have some kind of outlet and
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.320]   community is great because at the end of the day, when you sit there and say, Oh, well,
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.200]   we want the Russians to overthrow what okay, it's hard to do that when they shut down everything
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.360]   on you. So I'm glad that they're finding an outlet, which most things happen in the world,
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:51.920]   human beings find a way to find each other. And so that's good. Apparently, according to the Wall
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:07:00.560]   Street Journal, Westerners are using text messaging to text normal everyday Russians about the war,
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:08.400]   send them messages about the war. A whole database of 140 million email addresses and 20 million
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.760]   cell phone addresses was leaked by a group of Polish programmers and Americans and others in
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:20.400]   the West have been calling and emailing saying, I hear that and all I think is,
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.640]   I'm sitting here getting robo calls. How did they get one? What is going on? Are we the baddies now?
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:36.240]   Hi, you're a warranties expiry and that would freak me out. I'm like, what?
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:47.120]   Anyway, let's take a little break. Fun to have real people in studio, not drunk though.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.600]   You sure you don't want to beverage at this point? Yeah, what does the liquor get? It's all beverage.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.360]   I have one. It's over there. It's over there. You go find something.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.720]   Pay these books. I mean, while I pay the bills, our sponsor today, this segment is New Relic.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.160]   Love New Relic. And if you're a software engineer, a sysadman, a dev op, you're going to love New
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.520]   Relic too because you know the worst thing in the world. Middle of the night, phone rings,
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.000]   beeper goes off, text messages start pouring in, something's broken, the server's down,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.760]   the database is chugging, your queries aren't going through and you're going, oh, no. And here's
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.240]   the problem for more than half of the companies out there in the world. And this is from a study
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.360]   from New Relic. They don't have network observability implemented. Only half of all organizations
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.080]   have implemented observability for networks and systems. And if you don't have it and something
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.840]   goes wrong, you're in the dark. You don't know, but it won't happen if you get New Relic. New
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.600]   Relic can tell you instantly what's wrong so you can fix it and go back to bed. New Relic
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.400]   combines now six, they keep expanding, but they have up to 16 different monitoring programs.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.080]   Things you might buy separately or try to use separately. But you know, that's hard too. If
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.760]   you've got 20 different programs and you're going from this one to that one and your team's trying
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:14.000]   this, this is all unified. One place, one stack, one UI, you get application monitoring, APM.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.640]   So you can see exactly what's going in your apps and your microservices. If you're using
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.360]   Kubernetes, you'll love pixie. Great observability, distributed tracing. Let's just see all your
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.800]   traces without management headaches. So you can find and fix issues fast, network performance
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:36.000]   monitoring, no more data silos. You get a system-wide correlated view. So you can immediately pinpoint
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.840]   the problem and fix it. And that's just four of the 16 monitoring apps. So many people have
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.120]   discovered New Relic. And once you do, you'll never go back. You can even pinpoint issues down
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.680]   to the line of code. So you know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. Dev and ops teams at
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:01.920]   DoorDash love New Relic GitHub uses it. Epic Games, more than 14,000 companies use New Relic to debug
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.680]   and improve their software to keep the network running. Whether you run a cloud native startup
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.160]   or a Fortune 500 company, it just takes five minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:19.680]   And here's the really good news. It's free. It's the whole New Relic platform and 100 gigabytes
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.280]   of data per month free forever. You don't even have to give them a credit card. Because they know
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.480]   if you love it, you're going to want it and you're going to want more. The next 9 p.m. call just waiting
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.040]   to happen. Get New Relic before it does. You can get access to the entire New Relic platform,

[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:56.480]   My suffer with ignorance. Get observability in your network today. New Relic.com/twit. We
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:03.600]   thank them so much for supporting Twit. All right. We reassemble. You couldn't find any liquor, huh?
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:10.880]   You got a La Croix instead. Oh, no, you got a crush. Orange Crush. That's a classic. I didn't
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   know they still made that stuff. Not only do they make it, it's fully stocked out there.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.800]   We drank some of your moonshine something. Oh, you put something in there? No, no, we just
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.240]   just tried to show it. It was like, wow, that's really sweet. A what? Mescal or you don't even know
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.280]   what it was? No, the whiskey moonshine. That's the one. Something called whiskey moonshine.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.760]   Yeah, they had a name before that. Okay, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, well, I'm not driving
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.560]   out. Obviously, the good stuff is locked away somewhere, so I need your keys.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.280]   Oh, no, I know. You know what? The problem is I'm a little busy here. Oh, yeah, you got to
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.200]   show me. I would gladly show you. It's in the cabinet above, up above the, where all the vinegar
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.760]   is and the salt and pepper in this. All right. Up above there. Well, let's talk about a show,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.880]   and I'll run on the show again. It's a cabinet full of liquor. I'll check. I just look for the
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.760]   fanciest bottle. I might have already taken it as my to-goge cup, but we'll discuss it later.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.720]   Let's see. MGM deal done. Amazon gets eight and a half billion dollars worth of nothing.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.360]   Actually, they get James Bond. Yeah. Half of James Bond. They didn't even get all the James Bond?
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.800]   Well, it's like, yeah, on productions, the broccoli family owns part of James Bond, and they have to,
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.360]   well, no, they own part of James Bond period, and they have to like, they produce it, and they have
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.000]   to approve of it and stuff. So it's not like a lot of stuff. This shows you how desperate companies
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.800]   are for content, and especially for catalog. Well, not only are you desperate, but you're in a
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.280]   situation where there's four quarters on the table. And if you take two of them, there's only two left,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.520]   and I better get one, and I've got to get it now. So because the whole sharing and cutting off things,
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.320]   it makes people upset. You know, people want to look at Netflix and watch the office every day for
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.120]   the rest of their lives. And when it comes off for six months, they lose their mind. So, you know,
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.760]   you got to, it's a finite source. I think the Amazon one also really showed up the problem you've
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.320]   got in regulation in this country in that I'm pretty sure Khan would have liked to have blocked
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:17.520]   the steal if she'd had the ability. But because the Senate is not getting a new democratic FTC member.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.840]   You're talking about Lena Khan, the chairman of the FTC. Yeah. So she doesn't have enough votes on the
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.800]   she doesn't have enough votes because they're refusing to appoint a democratic
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:32.240]   FTC member. And it's a it's a pain because you desperately need more competition in this country.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.040]   And be that's just a wrath of Khan headline waiting to happen there. So, you know,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:43.760]   so finally you get Tomb Raider obsidian Creed three legally blond three some of the big titles.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:57.440]   I don't forget Stargate one of my favorite. Did you see though the EU approved this deal
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   with the sort of saddest backhand to MGM ever they said we approve this because MGM's content
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.840]   cannot be considered must have. So were they point five billion?
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:17.520]   Her older guys. I don't G.I. Joe. Okay. G.I. June. Not so much. The Rocky series. That's pretty
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:24.160]   good stuff. Yeah. But MGM classic MGM already sold off back in the day. That's Turner era.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.920]   Most of its catalog. So what what MGM is as a holding company is a very weird collection of
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.960]   catalog stuff and franchises. It's that's why it's not considered a must have. But it was something
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:41.120]   and I really keep wondering where the musical chairs game is going to stop because there's still some
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.520]   stuff out there. I read a piece this week about how now that CBS and Viacom have merged together
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.320]   and become paramount. The next order of businesses for them to see if they can find somebody to
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:58.960]   unload CBS television to because once they get rid of their broadcast network they can sell the
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:06.080]   rest of the company to Comcast or a chart or media right to one of the other companies.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.760]   And they're doing that because they get annoyed one the Paramount beast that is a new streaming
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:17.600]   service is like okay but Warner Brothers owns a lot of the CBS content. So I'm not going to go
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.720]   sign up for Paramount because I can get Sheldon and stuff like that on HBO Max and so it's a
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.600]   tug of steel there. Yeah. It's a tug of war of what's going on and who's doing what and I'll tell you
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.680]   what Mr. Leo report what Mr. Vanderpump rules. I might come to you and ask you for your catalog.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.400]   I wish we can text. We got a lot of old shows. We got a lot of old shows.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:44.320]   Showing on age. If you want to know that Windows Vista I got a show for you. Don't
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.880]   lie to the people of Glue. It's good content. It's good content. You can broker that deal.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.160]   I can run on a streaming service. I'm smart. I'm like a good guy.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:00.720]   Hey, hey, hey. There is. There is on Twitch a stream of ancient computer shows most of which
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.080]   they're getting from the Internet Archive. Like old computer chronicles. They have a show of mine
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:12.400]   which I wish I thought there were no copies left but apparently they got one and they just run that
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   24/7. I don't know if anybody watches it. Somebody's watching it. It must be right.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:22.000]   Somebody's watching us right now. So what's really happening is broadcast is dying and
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.720]   streaming is coming. Yeah, or at least broadcast is a very different business from streaming and it
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.240]   has a bunch of regulations because it's over the air airwaves. So you think it'll see. CBS will
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.560]   continue. Well, actually, if you look back to the Fox deal where the Murdoch family sold Fox to
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:48.160]   Disney but they split off the Fox broadcast network and cable channels that do news and they took
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   that separately. One of the reasons is that Disney owns ABC and so they couldn't literally could not
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:00.000]   sell the Fox broadcast network to the owner of ABC so they split it off. I think that's the thought
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.840]   process behind what may be going on at Paramount is they need to unload CBS and CBS News and there's
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.000]   a business to be run there but it's a real different business and it's not a growth. It's not the same
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.760]   as the Internet. It's not going to excite investors and then they can sell their catalog to the highest
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.000]   bidder and the truth is Paramount. I mean, somebody will get Star Trek out of it. Somebody will get
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.040]   there's some there's some good stuff in the catalog but they can then try to auction it to
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:32.560]   Netflix or Disney or Warner Media or Comcast or Apple or Amazon and get somebody to buy it
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.920]   because none of those buyers want TV stations. They just don't want that. Well, even CNN is going
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:47.120]   to streaming. They're going to launch in a week. CNN plus. Is that them saying the future is this
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:53.520]   or that's them hedging their bets? It's both. You talk about this a lot on your show. Yeah,
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.840]   yeah. I have a podcast called Downstream that people can check out. It's all about this stuff
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:04.960]   but CNN is a money maker because every person who subscribes to cable gets money, puts money.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.720]   Some of their cable bill goes to CNN. It's just part of how cable TV works.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.640]   And so that's a lot of money and they don't want to give it up. So they're building a separate
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:18.400]   streaming service that won't anger their cable partners and won't shut off that spigot which is
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.040]   going to shut off but it not yet and they can build this other thing. But with this guy coming in
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.480]   and buying them. How did they think cable operators are? I guess CNN is not the same as CNN plus.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.760]   I think it's more about the contract, right? I think they have some contract. That was a
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.280]   problem. You could not and this is way back in the day 20 years ago but even then the cable
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.240]   contract said you may not put more than 10 minutes of your content on the internet because we want
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.320]   people watching the cable. Yeah, it's too much money. It's a little like like sports like baseball.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.680]   You can't give it up. It's too much money from cable. They can't give it up. So they're trying to
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:55.120]   build a parallel product with some of the same names so that they can start at least building a
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:59.920]   foundation in streaming so that when the cable money goes away or becomes untenable then they
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.200]   have something that they can migrate to. That's what they're doing. It's an edge. We're at the
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.280]   point right now where I just wish that cable would just say, "Hey look, you can't afford
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.640]   Netflix, Hulu, Disney, ESPN, CNN plus." You know what you're doing? You're ending up paying for the
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.960]   cable service that you said was $200 and $300 a month. Let me do this for you. Let me just knock
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.920]   the bill down to cable TV with your internet for $100. Come back to us. The dinosaurs now the
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:36.240]   media are right and let's write this ship because as everything we say is network media is dying,
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:45.520]   my god, again, just to run off the list, paramount, Disney. Who can afford besides us in this bubble
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:50.160]   to pay for anything? And then they get mad because people are sharing. Well, that's why I share gas
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.360]   right now if I could because if something gets too high, you got to figure out a way. So oil is a good
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.240]   business. You can't share gas. Carpool. He got my back one. Now he's responsible. Netflix is going
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:07.520]   to start putting up a little notice saying, "Oh, I see you're sharing that password there." So the
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.680]   problem is with that they don't know any difference. I'm going to tell you I use YouTube TV. And as I
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.400]   come out here and I'm traveling it says, "Are you leaving your area? Have you moved?" That's fine. But
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.920]   guess what? Everyone in the Northeast, there's 62 people on my YouTube account that tip me $25
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.640]   a month. I don't know my name. I say whatever I want. You jump with the camera. YouTube and
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.480]   the Northeast, I have 62 people using my YouTube TV account. I got them all sending me $20 a month.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.640]   They send you money? It's $20 better than $65, isn't it? Yeah. Well, the year it's your land
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.720]   windfall. I mean, I'm doing all right, Uncle Leo. There's things out there that we can do in a
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.320]   year. But I get the notice when I leave the region otherwise, or you're in Atlanta now. But no one
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.080]   else gets the thing that says, "Oh, there's 22 people on your account right now." So again, go
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.080]   ahead. There were good things and do what you wanted to do. They're working on top. That
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.760]   notice is up there because of a cable TV contract. It's the same thing, right? They're like,
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.680]   "You must not serve this out of the locals." You're a low-boozer now. You can't watch the Lakers
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.760]   game even though you're in LA. So they don't feel like they're not checking your moves. They're
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.280]   checking to make sure you're not watching Philly games. I have through BoTV.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:18.320]   And it's got an interesting thing where you can take your tablet or your laptop anywhere.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.800]   But if it's a box, a set-top box, your account can only be in one region. And they will. That's
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.200]   the one where they'll be like only one region at a time for an Apple TV. And I always thought that
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.480]   was really hilarious because it's like anybody can use it on an iPad. Like nobody cares. It's
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.520]   only if you hook it up to a TV that they even check. But you're right. I mean, this Netflix thing
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.960]   is happening. I think it's starting in South America now. But yeah, they're threatening this,
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:49.360]   are you in the household? But see, I mean, I share my Netflix with my kids.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.000]   Yeah, me too. They're in my household. They don't live with me. But that's my family. And they also
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.040]   share my Apple account. And we travel. And sometimes a family travels and some of them travel and some
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.280]   of them don't. So how do they really stop? And that's what I mean about the pushback of it.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.320]   Because if you really wanted to enforce this, guess what? You're going to lose money.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.400]   At the end of the day, that's what I mean about coming back to me. Not only are they going to
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.280]   cancel, they're going to find a loophole. They're going to go somewhere else. Right.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:21.600]   Because this was a back in the cable TV days. This was a big cat and mouse game where people would
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:28.400]   split the cable. And they would and I remember direct tea. Was it direct TV or was it
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:35.360]   somebody they were you would share the box. Oh, maybe it was like one of those cable guy.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.000]   It was a hot box for you. And then but then what they did is there was this real cat and mouse
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.440]   game. They'd sent this in shards. They'd send a little detection program down a bit at a time.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.040]   And then it would assemble itself. And suddenly everybody'd lose their cable.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.720]   And they would go back and forth. Was it Tivo? I kept trying to remember who it was. Somebody in
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.960]   the chat room. Chat room. Remember. So Netflix. One of the things Netflix is going to offer.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.120]   And this is in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. This is what you were talking about is well,
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.400]   if you want to share your account, you can just pay a little more.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:14.080]   Pay a bit more. I'm paying too much. What they want you to do is think they know.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.640]   So you want to be honest. So you say, Okay, fine. I'll give you a little bit more.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.520]   And you're not going to be able with that. You're saying what they're not going to say is
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.640]   we have no idea. Because there's a base of speed limit 65 miles an hour. Do you know how many people
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.360]   only go 70 because it says 65? Yeah, four miles. Because they told yourself, I'm good with a little
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.200]   bit of cheating, but I'm not really trying to break the law. So sending this message out is going
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.200]   to get them just enough to feel daring. Yeah. So it is going to get them a little money and
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.480]   make some shareholders happy. Matter of fact, that's really what this is for. This is for
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.160]   shareholders and make them to be proactive. And look, we're doing something we're trying. Look
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.760]   over here. Nobody looked behind the curtain. We're doing it because I'll tell you what Netflix
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.920]   you're not going to stop me. There is an interesting business model in there though.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.520]   In that if you're trying to actually, if someone isn't a Netflix customer and you're trying to
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:05.840]   explain to them, oh, I saw this show, you should really check it out. And then you can pay like a
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:11.280]   one off fee just so they can view one episode. That might be quite lucrative in the long run. But
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.240]   agree with what you're saying. They are taking the piss on this somewhat. Interesting. See,
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.360]   this is good. This is why I got to have these people to explain this to me. Because I don't
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.400]   understand it. And you come in, you explain it all to me. I'm down here on the ground level.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.440]   You're on the 51st floor, Uncle Lee. You're still at that guy. Not so bright. Not a bright guy.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.760]   Got a selling kind of got kind of got put out of business selling the fire sticks over at the
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.000]   South Park games. He's not a business. He's back. He got put out of business for a little bit
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.880]   because they shut down the fire stick act. But now he's got a subscription base where he pays
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.680]   some company like a hundred bucks and he charges you $10 a month like a cable company. You get
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.520]   all the channels. So he's got like a thousand people paying him 10 bucks a month. I'm just
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.680]   waiting for the FBI to kick down his door. But not my guy is back in business. It's not that
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.600]   different from what you're doing. What are you talking about? You do talk to me. I'm just here
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.520]   telling you I'm giving real award examples of what others are doing. And I've done nothing wrong.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:14.880]   Microsoft says no, we didn't mean to tell the publish this externally. People with Windows 11
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:22.400]   developer editions were noticing there's there's an ad in my file explorer. It's not the first time
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.320]   they've done this either. No, I mean, and they didn't say we're not going to do it. They said this
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.800]   wasn't supposed to be. Yeah. We got we got cool. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Totally. Sorry. This is an
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.480]   example of what you might see. I think they've turned it off now. But you're browsing around
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.400]   looking at your PC, your mind documents folder and you get this. And by the way, it looks like an
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.720]   alert, right? It's a triangle with an exclamation mark right with confidence across documents,
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.320]   email on the web with advanced writing suggestions for from Microsoft editor. And they're really trying
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:57.840]   to upsell you a feature for office. Yeah. I don't know what you may even already have, by the way.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.080]   Yeah, it's called Grammarly. Oh, it's like Grammarly. You can just bum down by them
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.240]   as well. Because I mean, I'm by the way, Grammarly, Ukrainian company. Yes. Yeah. They are a sponsor.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.640]   And a lot of people are signing up for Grammarly just to kind of send money to your
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.040]   friends. That's a good idea. It's a professional journalist is just kind of like,
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:21.120]   it's a big grating when every time I try and far it's a music. You think you're a writer. That's the
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.880]   difference. I am a writer. There are a lot of people who have been doing it for 24 years.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:31.120]   Yeah. This is where it's by it. I've been writing for 42 years. I use it. But there are lots of
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.240]   those moments where it's like, Oh, you're trying to use style and creativity. Stop. Red underline
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.280]   them like just forget it. You know what? She loves it. Sometimes it'll say, and we're not doing a
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.440]   Grammarly ad here, but sometimes it'll say that was a little harsh that email. Maybe you'd like to
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:54.400]   just soften it a little bit. And she appreciates that because she's very direct. And she is,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.080]   she is a business woman. She does matter. She doesn't waste words in an email. She says what
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.920]   she needs. And I appreciate that. She gets right to the point. So that way, like, you know, sometimes
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   you get an email. It's nice to chuck and die. I want a phone call, but I'm going through 13
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.320]   emails. I agree. I need to get certain. Wait. Yeah. Yeah. But Grammarly will say, well, that was a
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.560]   little brusque. Grammarly hate helps me out because I write as I speak. And as you can tell,
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.480]   I speak very loosely. So it does tie me up when I'm in work mode. Anyway, they are a Ukrainian company.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.880]   Skylem, which does Luminar AI is a great photo editor. They're Ukrainian. They're writing
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:37.120]   Macpaw. Macpaw. Which does they have apps of their own. And they also have that Mac app
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:44.560]   like Netflix for apps, which is called Oh, now I can't even remember it. Yeah. There are a lot of
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:50.720]   really surprisingly large number. Yeah. A lot of very talented Ukrainian programmers out there.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:57.120]   So we're keeping them in our thoughts. I don't even know what's going to happen.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.840]   Set app is the name of set app. That's from the stream. And you know, it's they're all
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.040]   distributed and they've got a lot of people outside of country. And I think that they they
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:12.640]   Ukrainians have had seven sevenish years of awareness that Russia might invade their country.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.960]   So I think a lot of Ukrainian business people have done the thing where our servers are on
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.440]   Amazon. That's what Grammarly said. And we've got business offices all over the world. And we
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.960]   have tried to get our people who are in Ukraine to be safe or to get them out and have them work
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.080]   outside of the country. So those businesses are largely, you know, they can still operate. But
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.880]   obviously the hearts are back in Ukraine because that's where they're from. Yeah. I mean, there's
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.080]   also we were discussing this amongst ourselves last week. There's also the concern. And I think
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.520]   it was seeing this a lot with tech companies that have offices in Russia. There's concerned that
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:54.480]   the Russian authorities will put pressure on locals to allow them access to corporate networks,
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.720]   maybe even allow them to put malware onto systems. It's there's concern about Kaspersky, for instance.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.720]   I saw the German report. I saw you. Yeah, I saw Eugene's response. And it was a bit
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.760]   weasily to be honest. You know, it's funny. Eugene Kaspersky, whose company is named after him,
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.320]   is very well liked in the West. He goes to Davos. He's you've probably met him. I've
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.360]   quite wondered with him. Yeah. Exactly. You've gotten wankered with him. I mean, that means, but
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.640]   he's he's an interesting person. But someone who has a walrus penis bone on his desk.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.240]   It was a chit. I feel like a charm offensive. Yeah. That was very effective. And there he has a
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.120]   lot of defenders in the West. But at the same time, I think there's legitimate concern that
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.880]   Putin could say to him at any point, give us access and you have to give it up. Yeah.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.760]   Then again, the same could happen with under the Patriot Act in this country. True. But
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:56.160]   now, I mean, he's he's genuinely a nice guy. Kaspersky has had a lot of really bad press
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.840]   with no real evidence to support it. But it's and he does say that he's offered to,
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.520]   you know, have an independent third party go through his code. But at the end of the day,
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.400]   that doesn't really work. You don't know where it's stored. And one of the things Kaspersky does,
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.280]   like a lot of antiviruses is when it finds something suspicious, maybe not even something in its
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:18.720]   definitions, but something suspicious, it uploads it to the server. And that in fact, was how the
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:27.200]   NSA spy tools leaked. Now it was a stupidity on the part of an NSA contractor. Nevertheless,
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:33.440]   jotty is one of the central computer failings, which will always happen at the layer right
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:41.200]   problem is always going to be with us. Pebkak is the word of the day from John our board up.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:48.160]   Problem exists between chair and keyboard. Are you telling me Pebkak? Because
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:57.040]   Pebkak, no, okay. SpaceX lent or sent a bunch of Starlink terminals. Last I heard was about 15,000
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.080]   might even be more because the Starlink app is now the number one most downloaded free app in
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:10.080]   Ukraine. According to sensor tower, 21,000 downloads on iOS and Android, mostly from Ukraine.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:18.400]   It has become the way, I guess, to get internet in a country where the internet may be a little
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:24.240]   rocky. That $21,000 downloads was a week ago. I haven't seen anything more recently.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:29.200]   Yeah, when he first announced that I was kind of like, I thought it was a publicity
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:35.520]   stuff. It was like sending the submarine to the tide. Yeah. And then insulting the person that
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:40.480]   actually got them out. But it's a very very Elon. Yeah, it seemed like he was jumping on the
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.640]   bike and Pat machines to hospitals instead of ventilators that kind of.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.600]   He's got a reputation. Yeah, he does. And it's an earned reputation. But in something like this,
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.880]   I'm impressed, actually, they managed to get the hardware through because without the hardware,
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.960]   it's just a nonsense. But they have apparently managed to get some decent amounts of hardware
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:06.080]   through. I've seen pictures of trucks unloading the terminals. So that's impressive.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:14.720]   At least tens of thousands. I think it gets some units into Russia as well. So much of that up.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.000]   Now, I know you're a Formula One fan. I was up at six o'clock this morning to watch the race.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.520]   Oh, where was the first race of the season? First race of the season Bahrain this morning.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   8am PT. Don't say don't tell me anything. I know. Yeah, no more competitive Formula One this year.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.760]   I've got to say it was one of the best races I've seen in the long times.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:40.880]   Drivers are more important than they used to be. Yeah. And the aerodynamic changes on the cars
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.480]   mean that you can get much closer racing. They don't need the DRS as much. The DRS is actually
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:53.520]   really useful because we saw that was a classic like four or five laps with the lead changing.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.280]   And when you get within a second or two of the car, you can then you can open the back flat.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.640]   That will give you an extra 18 kilometers an hour very briefly.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:08.480]   But yes, clever thing. So Google is sponsoring the McLaren vehicle. I don't know if you noticed this.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:14.560]   I'd love myself sick of the after the end of the race. It's got Android on it. It's got the hubcaps
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:21.040]   apparently are the colors of the chrome browser. Yeah. Unfortunately, a Navy McLaren are they're
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:27.200]   a venerable team. They're very good at what they do. Last couple of seasons, they've been challenging
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:31.920]   Ferrari for third or fourth place. They've got Daniel Rochardo. They've got Legho. They have
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:39.840]   Danny Roch. They have Lando. Great. Great. Great. But after today, I can say that Google might
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:44.240]   consider considering going for it. Don't tell me I'm going to watch the race.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:53.360]   Okay. Without wanting to give too much away, it was physically painful to watch Danny Roch
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   trying to get past a Williams this morning. A Williams. Can I jump in and ask you a question?
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.880]   When does the F1 thing start with you watching F1 racing? When did I start watching F1?
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.240]   Oh, he said. 1970s. He said, "Brid." That makes sense. What about you?
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:16.320]   You know why Netflix drive to survive, so can I tell you that I watched a show? I got excited.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:23.120]   No. Okay. So it's like Wordle. It's like crack cocaine. You got hooked on drugs from a friend.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.360]   Aye, Pruitt. I went over. He made me an old-fashioned and he put me into it too. He put on an episode
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.440]   of F1. Try to get me. What is going on with you people and this F1 stuff? Oh, man. Netflix has
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.040]   done it again because if I hear it by the way, one more time from people who know the F1 drivers
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.000]   and teams pretty much hate the drive to survive folks. Max was asked to have anything to do with
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.920]   it. The best driver in the league. For good reason because they just make stuff up. I mean,
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.240]   in the last season. But it's been very good for me a little. Oh, no, no. It's brought a huge number
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:02.320]   of people in sports. I am very glad about that. But I even finished watch over last weekend and
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.200]   sort of live tweeted the whole thing. It makes it exciting. It's like a reality to make stuff up.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.160]   Well, it's really nice to you. You know, I mean, it's like manufacturing. It's a docudrama.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:17.600]   Yeah. You know, are you on drugs? No. Okay. No, I'm clean. The F1 drugs.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.480]   I'm not high on F1. Are you a wordler? I am a wordler. I'm a wordler.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:30.240]   I see the whole world jumping off a bridge. I sit back and say to myself, not me. Not today.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.800]   Oh, no, I say the word on the show me the bridge, baby. Here I come. That's one. Just the word.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:43.200]   I will tell you that every other sports league of any kind is extremely aware of what happened
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:51.200]   with drive to survive. Yeah. It's huge. Because it has driven so many new fans and so much interest
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:57.200]   to that sport. Yeah. And so get ready because there's going to be drive to survive clones for
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.480]   every single single. They're already, you know, and I bet you was a little inspired by. There's a
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:08.160]   very good series about the NFL where they cover one team. Hard knocks are very good. It does that
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.920]   for them because there's there are people that I know that don't watch football, but watch the
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.240]   hard knocks like it's a soap opera and this is a they're not really in a football, but they watch
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.480]   those like this. Their thing to watch. And I'm like, just watch. They're like, no, it's not the same.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.800]   It's not the back drama. It's not the private conversation. And I watch that. But when you
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.400]   understand what goes into a football team, what goes into planning, the way they study the opponents
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.720]   and all that stuff, it makes it more interesting. Yeah. I mean, he made me watch episode. I fully
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.240]   understand why again, it's crack cocaine. I understand why people on these drugs, I watched
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:44.640]   one episode of it is very well shot is very close. And they have amazing access. And except for
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   Max was happened. And if you don't know, and they didn't have Mercedes in the first season,
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.320]   they were talking to him. And I don't know anything about F one, but just watching one episode,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.640]   you learn a lot. You'll you learn a lot of whatever they're talking about. I don't know
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.800]   if it's the right day, but I'm learning a lot of something in one episode. I'll go, wow, you get
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:07.760]   a sense to know who the drivers are. It gives you it does it's very good in terms in some regards of
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.200]   the thing. If one's perfectly this, there's only 20 teams. There's only 40 teams, 10 teams, only 20
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:20.240]   drivers. So it's it's a very compact, easy thing to follow. There are a lot of races all of a sudden.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:26.560]   23 this season. Yes. But used to be a little more constrained. And so it's it's doable. The only
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:33.360]   thing is in the US, you have to get up at six in the morning to why. Well, I see I I generally,
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:39.680]   the races on US time Pacific are in the wee small hours in the morning. So I subscribe to the streaming
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.760]   service. Exactly. And that way I can watch the race and then pause it and go and make a cup of tea
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.320]   and my YouTube TV is set up to record every race. And if nobody like Ian tells me what happened,
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:55.440]   you seriously do not do not want to miss today's race. All right. See right. See,
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.600]   tell me good night. It goes right down. Yeah. The Ricky Bobby story. Yeah.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:05.680]   That's the wire. I'm going to bring it back to tech. Well, of course, F1, it couldn't be more
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:11.120]   technical. This is really a one of the driving computers. This is pretty amazing. I mean,
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:17.680]   if you look at if you actually follow one drive around on for one lap, you'll see they reconfiguring
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.440]   their engine, their brake balance. Amazing. You're basically reprogramming a computer while pulling
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.480]   5G corners and the physics. And that's what's interesting about this year's cars. They are
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.160]   using a lot more of the body to push them down into the ground. The physics of it is fascinating.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.720]   Yeah. I mean, that has caused problems because they're poor, particularly Mercedes are
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.720]   porpoising an awful lot. And that's quite dangerous. Whatever it is, I don't want it. Don't
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.840]   support this. Whatever you do to. So when is esports going to get a drive to survive? Because that's,
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.120]   it needs that to be. Well, that's why I told it. And when he tried to tell me about watching,
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.400]   like I was driving F1 in Monaco in 2006. Okay. My Xbox had me. I was living in Monaco. I know
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.760]   what's right and left to take. Okay. I know what I'm doing. I don't need F1 show. Give me my Xbox
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.680]   back and I could be an F1 racer. Because he said, I really would like to drive one of his cars.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.680]   I had to let him know he's less jockey. Last time we were in Monaco, I got a hotel on the hairpin
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:21.440]   turn. Oh, Raskas. Yeah. I've driven down that in a normal car and I worried. It's amazing. They
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.640]   got a nice plaque there. And then we walked the most of the circuit even through the tunnel there.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.600]   Yeah. It's quite a thing. Yeah. I've been in a video game. I've been there. Yeah, you've been there.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   You've raced Monaco. I have. Yeah. So I got a show for you, Leo. Start here.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.600]   Esports documentary called Ecstasy of Order, the Tetris Masters.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:48.880]   You can learn all about the search for the greatest Tetris players. And if you haven't seen it,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.960]   go on YouTube for the Tetris Championship's matches. It is not. I want to see this.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.840]   Kind of exciting to watch, but the announcer's lose. I had no idea they were Tetris champions.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:06.080]   This is a Johnny. This is a 10 year old. Amazing documentary about Tetris. Yeah.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.480]   This is a competitive Tetris. A friend comes and offers you free drugs. And what do you guys do?
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.880]   Click right on it. Load it right off. Let's just watch the preview. You can touch it very
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:21.680]   accurately. I believe that Tetris may well be the first virtual. Oh, I told you.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.280]   That was pretty short. So we've been talking for 10 years about the first virtual sport.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.080]   Yeah. Yeah. He's driving this perfect, right? Because how would you improve it?
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:36.000]   Not just a game. It's a history. It's not just evolution. See, it's drive to survive. Yeah.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.320]   For Tetris. Yeah. Danny Ricardo looks like he goes to the bars. He knows some girls.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:48.800]   He's a human. The people who play these games. Look at this. Look at these people. You do,
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.120]   you know, you get your Netflix series. You're going to a lot of the esports,
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:56.960]   actually not Tetris maybe, but a lot of the esports people. They are kind of becoming rock
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.280]   stars and they have their their attitude and like it's it's going to happen. The teams.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.080]   Yeah. For League of Legends and Dota 2 and these teams. For some reason, Moeba is really
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.480]   secret. But I do enjoy watching like 14 year old kids playing Tetris and hilarious.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.000]   That's the other thing. You're watching somebody drive. You're watching somebody play football.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.320]   There's emotion. There's these guys basically you watch and play their slack job. Yeah. Yeah,
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.360]   because they're exactly because that's when they went. Yeah. That's the hard thing about
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.600]   esports translating to draw. Do via drama is that so wait for VR esports and then we will see them
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.400]   flailing around. So they've tried. They've had celebrities play on these teams and all sorts.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.800]   When you watch esports, they get hype. They yell at each other. So I bet as much as the F1 racer
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:41.200]   can sit in his car and do this and with a helmet on, I can't see his face. I can't see his emotion.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:47.120]   I just figured out, what I want. Can't these guys go in 80 miles an hour down a straightaway
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:56.880]   play in Tetris? Yes. Now you got to sport. No. Yeah. But drag Tetris. The last thing I'll say is,
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.840]   yes, these guys in F1, they remind me of like horse jockeys. They get out of these cars and they
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:08.240]   what are they like? Five two like five more. Oh, I mean, say George Russell is just under six foot.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.760]   Your ideal hype for a Formula One driver is about five, seven, five, eight. Okay.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.400]   Yuki is well under that, but everyone loves Yuki. But it is a real problem for the taller drivers.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.880]   Yeah. You can be too tall for the sport. Yeah. And it was again, he was like, I would just do
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.560]   one lap. I was like, you wouldn't fit in one car. And you're in shape too. Like you're too big.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:33.920]   I've driven F1 simulator. Sort of one of the factory teams. And I just, you have an
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.840]   awesome respect for the people that can do that because they said, yeah, okay, well,
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.120]   do you want to go in on easy mode or do you want to go in on actual mode? And I said,
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.320]   actual actual, of course, don't know the thing three times just on just trying to get it to move.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:50.880]   And you're just squished in there. I mean, I got stuck in that Tesla roaster ones and I
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.840]   couldn't imagine being in the F1 video. I got stuck in Jason Calcalfa, Tesla. And he first got
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.840]   the first Tesla. I remember. Sometimes. Okay. That was a teatop. That's the only way I got
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.720]   actually if you watch more of the drive to survive, you see almost all these drivers do play video
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.960]   games. They love the driving games. Because if you look at the, I mean, one of the things
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.840]   they have to, they'll have now got eye level cameras.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:21.280]   Just a very fun to watch those cars. Well, I mean, you can pick, you can pick which driver you
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.800]   want and you can have that their actual view. But it doesn't make you realize most of the stuff
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.200]   is muscle memory. You know, they're not in a position where they can see the corners. They
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.440]   have to know it exists. They walk the track. They walk it many times. They literally memorize it.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.680]   Just to get in. You can't be thinking what I'm going to do here. You know, it's all got to be
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.240]   automatic. Yeah. Yeah. Let's take a little break. I think you're going to like this next sponsor,
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.600]   Owen JJ Stone. This weekend tech is brought to you by Coinbase. Have you ever heard of them?
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.720]   You know, Coinbase. I do know Coinbase. Much coin. Such base. If you've been following,

[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:12.240]   Coinbase makes it quick and easy to set up your own portfolio to trade like a pro. I know everybody's

[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:57.360]   A mobile app. Actually, my daughter was very interested in all this got coin base so she could

[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.640]   That's cool. I didn't actually know that you would have it and be into it and know all that.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.480]   But I just thought maybe because you're a hip, you're like with the, you're with the latest stuff.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.960]   I'm all the stuffs, the things. I can report from the liquor cabinet that it's called Dixie
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:16.880]   Moonshine. Dixie Moonshine. I can report. It's delicious. Also, the Prosecco is there.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:24.160]   You're my best mate. You're my best mate. Come on, everybody in this podcast. I've written the poet.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.840]   I will say it was like that we grabbed a glass and had a shot of it. We're like,
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.560]   "Are we going to get back?" It's like smoking in the boy's room. You want to do that. You can do
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:42.880]   that in the next commercial. Amazon, it's been revealed, had a project, Iliad, to discourage people
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:50.720]   from canceling their Amazon Prime accounts. I read that and I was kind of like,
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.400]   "Of course they've got something like this in place." I mean, you jumped into the patents.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.960]   It works. You may have run into this. This is from Business Insider. They got internal documents.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:11.680]   So if you went, and this is a 2017 era, but if you went to cancel Amazon Prime before you could
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.200]   cancel, this is a dark pattern you will see everywhere. Before you could cancel, they started
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:25.920]   asking you a bunch of questions and offering you a bunch of offers. They launched this in 2017.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:32.400]   Prime cancellations dropped by 14%. When you're talking that the number is Amazon's talking,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:38.720]   that's a lot of money. The multi-step cancellation process, a version of which remains active,
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:47.120]   according to Insider. Basically, it's not illegal, but there have been multiple complaints filed
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:53.120]   with the FTC saying, "You really got to look into these dark patterns." That's the new thing,
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.480]   dark patterns. I think Lena Kahn is very aware of dark patterns. I wouldn't be surprised if the
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.840]   FTC is receptive. Is this dark pattern new from Comcast Cable? What I've been dealing with from
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:10.240]   trying to cancel a credit card or your cable company, and you will start crying and hang up and
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:16.000]   have to regroup and call back the next weekend? Much less of moving out of the states,
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.040]   a family member who is deceased and you're saying, "My father no longer lives. I need to close this
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.640]   account." It is hard. Let me tell you. When I close my Facebook account, literally, the first
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.640]   thing they do is they put up a picture of 20 of your friends and saying, "They're really going to
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:40.400]   be sad to see you go." They might as well play that. It's like, "Talk about guilt trip."
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:44.160]   I'm surprised they don't actually have somebody literally call you and be like,
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.360]   "Look, I just got the word that you were thinking of canceling a…"
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.400]   Are you really sure you have to tell me direct? There's some screenshots.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.320]   Wasn't there a case, I think, a couple of years ago about journalists recorded himself
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.680]   trying to cancel Comcast? It was like half an hour.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:08.400]   So I used to use the trick of, "I'm going to cancel. Give me sale." They did it. Then they
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.320]   got to the point where they were like, "No sale, no nothing. Cancel." As soon as you leave,
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.520]   then they spam you to death with the sale to come back. I'm like, "I tried to negotiate with you
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.560]   terror work and it didn't work. Now you want me to come back to this abusive relationship?"
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:28.320]   Now, I don't know if this works, but I was complaining about this to her friend. She was just like,
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.960]   "There's a shibileth. There is a way around this." What you do is you say, "No, I'm actually
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.880]   moving in with my partner and they already have Comcast." They're just kind of like, "Oh, fine.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.560]   Okay." That sounds sick. Like I said, that's a good trick.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.720]   But I'm making up to ask you who your partner is. You just say, "Leo, report."
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:54.720]   He's got all the services. Here's the screenshot. Hannah's trying to quit Amazon Prime. First
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.480]   thing says, "Hannah, don't give up on movie night. You still have seven days left." Then it says,
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:07.840]   "Hannah, save $40.88 over 12 months by switching to annual payments." Then there's the top number
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:15.840]   one button. Keep my membership. You press continue to cancel. Hannah, we're sorry to see you. Go
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:21.680]   please confirm the cancellation of your membership with not one, not two, not three, not four, but five
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:28.480]   completely confusing buttons. Good luck trying to figure out which button to cancel.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:31.280]   I'm amazed they didn't put a picture of a sad kitten up there or something.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.400]   This and people trying to get customer services the hardest thing to do with Amazon.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.320]   Yeah. It amazes me again, when I was working in the storage during the pandemic,
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:46.400]   people were like, "I can't get to customer service." I'm like, "Oh, it's easy. When you
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:53.120]   know, it's fine." But most people have no idea that it's even possible to reach Amazon to talk to
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.640]   anyone. It's chat or nothing. Even that doesn't alleviate your problems. They get you in that
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:06.880]   funnel. You'll fresh. I bought Final Cut Pro for my M1 Mac. After I did the horrible thing of,
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.400]   I just did the demo because I didn't know I was getting back into the Mac life. I was like,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:14.480]   "Let me download the demo." Just to be clear, you don't really need the Ultra, do you?
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:22.400]   No. No. You don't really need the Ultra. Frankly, the Macs would be plenty, wouldn't it?
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.880]   The Macs would be overkill for a spreadsheet. Don't worry. I got you.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:35.840]   I got you. I got my M1 Mini and I wanted to check out Final Cut because everyone said it was
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:39.440]   optimized for it. I did the trial just because I didn't want to. I didn't always get back to the
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:43.920]   Mac life. When I got the trial, I was like, "Oh, this is actually legit. This is really good.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:49.760]   Let me buy it." I purchased it. They charged my card. They never sent me the activation.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:57.120]   Let me tell you, I contacted Apple. I was on the phone for 12 hours. I gave up. Not 12 hours.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:03.120]   Let me lie. Four hours the first time I gave up. I waited six months and I tried again.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.360]   Four more hours. They still never sent the email. The third time after nine months,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.400]   right before I got this, I said, "I'm getting a professional machine. I need this." I was about
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.040]   to pay for it again. Six hours on the phone, they finally got me what I needed so I could get
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.240]   Final Cut on my laptop. Talking to someone in customer service was in San
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:27.920]   San Francisco. I talked to 20 different people every call and no one knew how to send me at code.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:34.640]   I'm very impressed. Apple has a phone number. I have been trapped where you were trapped.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:42.160]   Amazon, you mentioned Amazon. Amazon, good luck trying to find a phone number for Amazon to talk
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:48.400]   to a person. That's absolutely delicious. Where I find it is you Google, "Call Amazon
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.880]   customer support." There are web pages elsewhere with the number because Amazon does not want you
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:59.600]   to call. Because what? Every customer service call costs money because you don't pay somebody.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:05.520]   Amazon really doesn't want to talk to you. Here from our chatroom, Harkanoos, I never heard of this
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:12.640]   site, accountkiller.com. They have how to kill accounts, all kinds of accounts. This is how to
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:19.200]   delete your Amazon Prime account. They have a how to get rid of all kinds of stuff.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:24.480]   There recently, there have been some laws that in some states, at least, where if you're
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:30.240]   selling a phone line, you have to be able to cancel on them. Just the pro tip for all the listeners
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:36.080]   out in the world, you go to Amazon.com on any web browser. You click the three dots in the
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:41.120]   left-hand corner, you scroll all the way down to customer service, and then you click request
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.760]   a call, and then they call you. That's the quickest, fastest way to do it. But again,
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:50.560]   we live in a mobile world. There's no way to do that on your phone. You have to be on the web browser
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.320]   to get to it to happen. When people are out and something's wrong with a delivery, whatever you
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:59.040]   want to do, they have no way to get to anyone. But the real question is, why would you ever want
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:06.560]   to kill your Amazon account? Are you insane? How do you get stuff? Everybody's competing now.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:11.680]   I got Walmart delivering to me the same day. No charge. I've got Target out here with the
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:14.960]   team there. He's buying from Walmart, though, really better in any way.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.360]   Oh, it might be better when I'm not paying a subscription.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.560]   Yeah. For a certain day, especially-
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.840]   They have their prime account.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:26.480]   Well, people are now getting a lot of food delivered from Amazon. So it makes more sense for having
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:30.560]   these stores like a Walmart or a grocery store to be able to provide that. And guess what?
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:30.880]   Or-
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.160]   If I'm a person who is disabled in some way and maybe I can't afford a more fixed income,
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:41.040]   and I don't use Amazon like that, but I can now get fruits, vegetables, food delivered to me,
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.280]   for free with other options. The competition is great because it's making for other things to
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.680]   come out. But then again, we're at the same carrot and stick. How many subscriptions can I
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   afford and survive before I'm back to paying a million dollars?
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.440]   Open up your Coinbase. Can you buy board apes, ape tokens?
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.640]   You could. I wouldn't suggest it at the moment.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:09.040]   The board apes who somebody told me had merged with the the board apes yacht club had merged
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:15.120]   with the crypto zombies into a giant crypto NFT bonanza.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:21.600]   The board apes are, of course, the board apes yacht club NFT project. They have announced their own
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.840]   crypto coin.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:32.320]   Wow. The price of admission to purchase the cheapest of the 10,000 images on the
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.520]   board, its yacht club is $240,000 worth of the food.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.560]   That is a discount.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:43.920]   It's a world now knows this is bogus.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.360]   I've said this many times, and I'll say it again.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.000]   How much would you pay for the Mona Lisa?
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.720]   Oh, well, okay. Here's my question to that. At one point, it had no real time to how much I
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.440]   could sell it for, isn't it? Yes. It had no real value. So anything that you design or
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.240]   divine or feel that is art to you, why would you pay for McLaren versus a Ferrari?
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:13.440]   Why is one more expensive than the other? Well, at least you could drive that.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:18.320]   As art, you look at pictures on the wall, your emblem signifies twit.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.560]   When people see it and they know the brand, they know it in an apple. Every time you look at an apple,
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.720]   you think of an apple icon. What value does it have? But its only value is if you can sell it to
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.480]   somebody, some other sucker for more. Or if you hold on to it and then begin, everyone
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:37.360]   becomes a sucker. Again, how much would you pay for the Mona Lisa? Well, nothing.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:41.440]   All suckers were human beings. You know, when I spent on apple, I'm trying to con you out of the
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.480]   ocean. I give you a hundred bucks. I'll give you a hundred bucks for the Mona Lisa.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.320]   Well, there we go. Will you give it to me? Yeah, I can print a picture up right now.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:51.520]   I was going to say, I think the French government might have to say.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.520]   I'm sure we got a color frame right now.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.560]   And I will sell it to you for 50, but what I'm really selling to you is a web page that says
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.000]   the OO owns the Mona Lisa. That's now you're talking half as much. So for none of the value.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.560]   A hundred percent of what James is. Even if it were the real Mona Lisa.
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:15.600]   I'll throw it in a printout too. Borrowing a solar flare. We're good to go with NFTs for people.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:20.960]   Thank goodness. Thank goodness. Beanie Babies. What is the thing? At least you get a baby.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:27.440]   Cabbage patch. I still get a thing. No NFTs are for suckers. Leo. And they're coming to Instagram.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.040]   By the way, technically Beanie Babies were also for suckers because the value of the whole
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.520]   crash is here. The only value of a Beanie Baby was the cuddle value.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.640]   At least you bought a Beanie Baby to sell it on. That was dumb.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:46.640]   Every number one issue of a comic book in the 90s too. This is going to appreciate
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.960]   my life. I hope you're like, are you a collector? Are you a collector? Do you collect anything?
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.400]   No. I mean old computers now. That's mostly because nobody will take them off her hands.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.560]   No, I go on eBay. I actually buy. I have a Mac Plus or actually a Mac 28 upgraded to a Mac Plus
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.280]   that I got up and running. We should have sold you. We have the 20th anniversary. Matt, we got rid of.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:11.440]   Oh, you got rid of it? Yeah. What happened to that, John? Did we just gave it a way?
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:18.320]   My God. Those go for money on eBay. Jason, you didn't take you to the basement?
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:21.520]   You've never been in a basement. Man. Have you ever been in a basement? No.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.800]   Okay. After the show, we're all going into the basement. Oh, God. Well,
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:29.440]   tell my family. I love them. Leo's got Cybertron.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:32.480]   Tell him. Okay. Most of his drones and he's crashed.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.880]   He has Cybertron under our feet right now. There is no basement in this building.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:43.600]   I just want you to know right now. You know, Trey Reklaub sent me an NFT. I don't know what I did
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:47.280]   with that. Who cares? You know what? But he's making money. Yeah, he's making.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.240]   Yes, I know. It's probably worth some. Do you know what? I've done this other thing in my
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.120]   gym. Yeah, but you don't. Yeah, I have a photo of his, but the NFT is not a photo. It's just an NFT.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:01.520]   You know what's going to happen to you? What? You are going to be looking back at this moment.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.120]   Remember, look at me in eyes right now for a second. You're going to remember this moment as the
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:10.160]   guy who also lost his password to his crypto wallet. These are the moments that will
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:14.000]   haunt you. You know, it's great about that. 10-15 years from now, if I hadn't lost the password,
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:20.560]   I would have sold that Bitcoin for 100 bucks a coin. I'd say I have 800 bucks.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:25.760]   No, my son wants me to send it to some because they can crack. A lot of that encryption is weak
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.680]   and it can be cracked. It's not weak. It's the Bitcoin. You got the good encryption.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:35.840]   I got the Bitcoin wallet and it's strong encryption. See, see, that feeling you have?
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.040]   That's what he has. He's loaded off. That's what you're going to have about NFTs later.
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:43.360]   Again, it's a scam. I'm not saying it's not a scam, but I'm saying you could have been in one
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:46.960]   and scared with green. You're agreeing. Yeah, because it's a pyramid scheme if you get it early.
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:53.040]   This is America. I sell NFTs. I'll be selling more NFTs. It's a thing to do.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:56.640]   Some people like it. Sometimes you get stuff away for free. America.
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.840]   It's what we do. I have a friend who had their kid made a thing that he posted on Twitter that
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:06.880]   became like a meme for a long time. And I said, you should get that made us an NFT. He says,
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:10.720]   yeah, but they're stupid. I said, yes, they are stupid. But if somebody will pay you or something
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.880]   like that that has no value, take the money. Yeah, but see, I won't even do it because I feel
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:19.520]   like I mean, we could sell NFTs. Trey said, oh, you should sell your bloopers as NFTs, but I'm not
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:27.280]   I feel guilty doing that. Yeah, give them away. Give them away. Yeah, make NFTs and give them to
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:30.800]   your what's the point of that? Give them to your discord holders. Once again,
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.440]   the same reason yourself bricks with somebody signing their name. But that was different. We
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:40.080]   build a studio out of that. It's different to you, but it's not different. It's symbolism.
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:43.840]   People who have never come to this building and have never actually touched their
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:48.000]   own URL. They'll own a URL. They'll have their name on here. So if you made NFTs and said, I'm only
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.720]   giving it to my discord members and holders, and they can have the value of that to them, it holds
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:56.960]   value to them. It means something to them. They're part of Twitter. And yes, I'm convincing you.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.080]   And Lisa, we're going shopping with the black car because we all need
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:04.960]   just except for him because he does not deserve it. Getting on my nose with these things. We're
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:10.640]   going to do it. New California bill. It's not a law, but it's proposed. Let parents sue social
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:17.760]   media companies for addicting kids. I think this is probably based on the Texas abortion law, where
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:25.280]   like we can't enforce anything. So let people sue and that'll do it. This is from Buffy Wicks of
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:31.120]   Oakland. She's co-sponsor of a bill that would obligate social media companies to not addict
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:38.320]   child users. I don't know how you do that. And if you if failing that, parents can sue. It's
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.040]   assembly bill. Could have was put a banner at the top saying, your mom and dad really like this site.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:50.880]   The work for Facebook, Assembly Bill 2408. It's known as the social media platform
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:02:00.480]   duty to children act. How do I acknowledge or evaluate or sustain the fact that my child's addicted?
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:07.040]   Who is going to pay for the suit? And secondly, this reminds me of like the 80s when they ran over
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:14.880]   CDs, music, and video games. I'm like, wait, what are we doing? It's too live crew. Okay,
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.120]   so your kids listen to it and they're what? They're singing songs? They're putting it kind of,
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.680]   what are we doing? The presumption is that media social media companies aren't tempting to
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:29.440]   addict people and could do something to prevent it. In fact, there's a safe harbor provision
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:34.720]   that would protect responsible social media platforms from being penalized if they quote,
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:41.280]   took basic steps to avoid addicting children. Can I start suing parents? Can I sue bad parents?
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.760]   I wish. Can I sue you for not keglier kid under control and the CVS, these don't M&M's at the
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.960]   back of my head? Can I sue you? Yes, you can. You can sue people for anything.
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.720]   If you want America under the lawsuit. Yeah, America.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:03:00.960]   I don't know. It does. It could pass. It could pass. I mean, you never know any day.
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.760]   Any given Sunday, these things could pass. Love your kids. Pay attention to them.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.520]   Take the phones away from them before they're big enough to beat you up when you try. Teach
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:15.280]   your children well. Let's take a little break. I want to tell everybody how to protect yourself
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:21.040]   online with the VPN I use, the only one I use and recommend Express VPN going online
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:28.400]   without Express VPN. It's fun because he's had every time they have some new metaphor, right?
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.200]   Last time was going to the bathroom and leaving the door open. Now it's like changing your clothes
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:39.840]   while leaving your window wide open. You might not have anything to hide, but why give strangers
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:45.920]   a chance to invade your privacy? I do use Express VPN. When you go online without Express VPN,
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.720]   Internet service providers could see what you're doing, see what websites you're visiting,
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.880]   and it's completely legal for them. In fact, they all do to resell that information to marketing
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.000]   firms and others without your consent. And you don't know data brokers. You don't know how that's
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.200]   going to be used. So that's one reason to use a good VPN. Another reason, of course,
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.960]   geographic restrictions that keep you from watching Dr. Who. If you have a Netflix subscription,
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.640]   you know, you can watch Netflix in a variety of countries and they have a completely different
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:23.680]   set of shows. So if you like anime, go to Japan, big button, you say, I want to be in Tokyo today.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:30.240]   Suddenly you're you're in Tokyo and you can watch Netflix, Japan. That's another good reason.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.800]   Another good reason is security. If you're in an open access point now that we're starting to get
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:40.320]   out and about, you better be using a VPN to protect you. But here's the catch. Here's the catch.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.200]   You got to trust the VPN because they know what you're doing. That's why you use Express VPN.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:50.240]   When you push the button and you join the server, the server is spun up in, they call it the trusted
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:57.120]   server technology in RAM only sandbox. So it can't write. Every time the server is rebooted,
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.760]   everything is erased and the things built from scratch. They do that at least once a week.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:06.400]   There is nothing on those servers. We know it because there have been and you can read the
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:10.320]   news stories. If you Google it, there have been countries where they don't have, you know,
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:16.320]   warrants. They just burst in, take the servers from Express VPN. There's nothing on them.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:22.320]   They can't do anything with them. You need a good VPN. You need somebody that protects your
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:28.720]   privacy. This is my VPN. So I know you know, yes, it's from tablets. It's fast. So you don't even
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.320]   sometimes you use a VPN. You go, boy, I can't take this much longer. You can put Express VPN on
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:40.000]   your router and the whole family, the whole house is protected. I know I have. They'll never say
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.600]   it worked because they don't even know, but they're safe. That's what's important. Browse
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:49.440]   anonymously, protect yourself from hackers. And of course, eliminate geographic restrictions.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:53.920]   It couldn't be easier. Express VPN as apps for phones for laptops. You could put it on your
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:57.840]   router. You could put it on your smart TV. You could put it everywhere. You are Express VPN.
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:03.440]   Why would you take off your clothes with a window wide open? Why would you do that? You
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:09.520]   wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it. Secure your own. I'm not doing it. You're not doing it.

[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:28.960]   months free with a one year package. Thank you, Express VPN for protecting us online.
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:35.600]   Before we go much further, we should probably take a look at the week that was some fun stuff
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:39.760]   happened this week. A lot of it. Watch. So you think I should just I think
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:07:01.280]   it's the manual. It's tiny. Okay. Previously on Twitter. Matt break weekly. So what Apple's
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:07.440]   doing is they're basically taunting Intel at this point. Intel held Apple back so significantly.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.760]   And what they've been able to do in just two, three years now is they've been able to rapidly
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.560]   expand the product line right now. So now we know how big the M1 Ultra is. It's as big as the middle
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:23.680]   finger. It's exactly right. It's the middle finger, right? Security now Russia has decided
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:28.400]   to start signing their own website certificates. And this is one of those. Oh boy.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:35.920]   Western certificate authorities are banned through sanctions to do business with entities
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:41.200]   inside Russia. So they're gonna do kind of a bell. This week in Google. Marco Rubio,
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:47.600]   the senator from Florida, he picks the big issues to stay on saving time for one thing in Congress.
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:52.320]   It's this. Wow. Stop changing the clock. You know what you could do if you don't want to change
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:57.920]   your clocks ever again. You'll just make every clock, an internet connected clock. It's not the
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:04.400]   actual physical act of changing the clock. I'm just saying if that's your issue, we can solve that
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:09.280]   today. Just don't want to be a different time. When I wake up, the ROT has spoken.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:18.160]   That by the way, that bill that was kind of sprung on the Senate and they passed unanimously,
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.600]   I don't think it's going to get through the house because it turns out to be very controversial.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:29.600]   Who would have thought it? People. Yeah. They were surprised. But I think it's I think it's bad.
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:34.720]   I mean, we in California, California, Oregon and Washington all have to a certain degree said
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:38.800]   they want to go to permanent daylight. We had a referendum. Yeah, because of where we are
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:44.000]   and would go all together. We're where we are positioned in the time zone. It actually kind of
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.720]   makes sense for us. But this law is really weird. It basically says everybody has to go to daylight
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:54.080]   saving all the time. States can't choose. And you know, we're going to just do it. And that's weird
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:00.240]   because there are places that probably should not do that that should choose another time. So why
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:07.520]   not let the states choose? Because it would be insane. It's already it's already insane. I have
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:13.040]   family in Indiana. There are two time zones in Indiana, very by by county, right? Like it wouldn't be
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.400]   that bad, but like Michigan has a good argument to make that they should never go to daylight saving
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:22.720]   time only because they're far enough north and they're far enough west in the eastern time zone
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:28.960]   that it's a bad idea. So let them not. But but this bill, nobody has a choice except for Arizona and
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:32.800]   Hawaii who can just stay with the way they are and just exempt it and the rest. Everybody else
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:38.080]   just has to go. What about the conspiracy theory? Man, the electricity companies want to have a
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:42.720]   dark sooner. So you turn on your lights and they get more money. Good. There's a minute there's
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:50.080]   lobbyists that are keeping us down. Man, you get up and going to school in the dark at 830 AM is
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.800]   the minute that that law goes away. You try going to Scotland. I mean, Scotland. Yeah, the more north
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:59.280]   you are, the worse it is. Yeah, you will you will get up in Seattle. It'll be dark at nine in the
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.640]   morning in the winter. It'll still be dark. Yeah, but it will be light in the evening when people
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:10.240]   are coming home from work. So it's a trade off morning people and night people are going to argue
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.480]   about it. It's a trade off. In some places, it makes sense. I think in California, it does make
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:22.000]   sense, but it's it's just weird that this past unanimously kind of quickly, like nobody paid
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.560]   attention to this, and that the way it's written is so strange where it's like, no, we're just going
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:32.720]   to be doing everything. Everybody now. Well, there's still some shenanigans that have to go on,
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:36.720]   including a vote in the house and the president has decided. I suspect it's not going to happen.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:40.400]   People are freaking out about the technical issue here since this is a tech show about like,
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.400]   you have to rewrite software in order to change it. But the truth is, a lot of the software these
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.880]   days is based on the UTC offsets. Yeah, and it's not a big deal. There will be a lot of like early
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.880]   crappy electronics that have it hard coded. But the fact is just a few years ago, we changed when
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:00.800]   the daily savings time ends. Yes, seven. And there are a lot of crappy clocks that were made that
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:07.600]   didn't work anymore for two days phones. 99 Y2K. Jason, we can destroy the universe.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.800]   Actually, for some reason, we can destroy the universe. Seems to have more trouble with the time
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.720]   change than anybody watches crashed. Oh, yeah. Those sorts of weird things have happened
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:20.720]   in the past. But normally all this technology, exactly, as you say, the software doesn't have
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:26.080]   time's hard coded in. It just knows what time zone am I in? Okay, I'll handle it from there.
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.400]   It's fine. And in fact, most will have a setting of like what time zone are you in.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.760]   Yeah, you could change it. And if you're a device that's on a network time server,
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:37.440]   then you're going to say what time is it? And it's going to know what time zone you're in,
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:41.200]   and it's going to give you the correct time. Basically, the hardware is in UTC anyway,
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:49.440]   regardless. Exactly. Yeah. Let's see. So anyway, we'll see what happens. Oh, the web.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:55.840]   Yeah. One amazing image coming back from the web. It's still not done completely with its
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:03.040]   calibration. But look at that picture. So for people who are watching this, just to be clear,
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:10.000]   all those little spots around the star, those are galaxies, deep galaxies. And this is a very
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.640]   limited exposure just for calibration. This thing is going to show us stuff back to the
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:20.400]   beginning of the universe that we've never seen before. And even in the calibration image of the
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:27.200]   one camera, you've got deep field galaxies back behind that star that they're using as their test
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.600]   subjects. You can kind of tell if you look at the image from NASA closely, they're not little
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.960]   pinpoints. You can see they look like little spiraling galaxies. Yeah, there's a on Twitter,
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:40.160]   I saw an astronomer who was walking through all the little smudgy galaxies and saying,
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:46.320]   like, what kind of galaxy this is? And we don't have the redshift data from this image. So we
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.600]   don't know whether they're like just in the line of sight or whether they're actually like
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.320]   colliding some of them and all of that. And that'll all come later. But this is also a
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.720]   test image. Yeah, that's all it is. It's false color also because this is infrared. You're not
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.960]   right because the further back in time you go, the further into infrared you have to go because
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.000]   the redshift. Yes. As a not bright person, can I just ask you one question? If I can see
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.680]   that those are galaxies, correct? Those are galaxies? Yeah. How come I can't look at planets
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:17.680]   and see if there's people walking around on there? Do we have satellite? Do you see people walking?
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:23.040]   I don't care about the eye. I want you if you can get that far back up, hit every
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.480]   single planet on the way there. If you say who's walking the telescope way far away,
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.080]   let me tell you. You could look back at us and you could see Jesus. I want it. So I'll ask you
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:37.040]   the question. I got two things. First is one of the things that's not widely known is a lot of the
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:43.840]   early space telescopes were spy telescope hardware that were given from the spy agencies to NASA,
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.240]   and they just turned them around and looked out at the universe. But the other thing that the
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:54.080]   Hubble Hubble Space Telescope has some spy telescope heritage. We'll put it that way. But
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:58.880]   Webb, here's the thing about Webb. You talk about seeing people walk around. Webb is not just going
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.600]   to look at stars far off in distant galaxies. It's also going to look at exoplanets. One of the
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:08.480]   things they think they might be able to do is even detect atmosphere and get the substances in an
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:14.240]   atmosphere of a planet, which might tell us if there was substances that had to be created by life.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.080]   So, plus, they may be able to look at other things in our solar system, other planets here
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.320]   more clearly than Hubble can do. So there's lots of other stuff. They're not just looking at far away
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:30.400]   now. Can I tell you something? That's all I ever wanted. That's all I ever need is say, yeah,
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.680]   I could care less about all the galaxy. I want to know what's going on. That's great.
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:41.040]   That might happen. It could happen. This is the first selfie from Space. This is the Webb
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:49.440]   Telescope selfie of itself. There you go. I saw it being built in Goddard and it was just an amazing
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.160]   picture. It was all folded up. It has to fit in the fairing of a rocket and then it's filled.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:59.360]   Ultimate on origami. Yeah, it's truly amazing. We're living in the future. It's amazing technology.
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.680]   They've been building it for a very long time. Everybody is so relieved that it finally got out
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:10.480]   there. But I guarantee you, as long as it continues to function like it has so far,
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.760]   I guarantee you fundamental things that we think about our universe will change because of what it
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.240]   finds. What do you think? Like how old it is, whether it's expanding? The most exciting thing is the
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.960]   stuff we don't know. We're going to see stuff and be like, "What?" And astronomers love that because
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.200]   that's the thing that makes them think, "Oh, now we've got to figure out why we're seeing this."
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.200]   And then they learn things about the universe. You can tell me there's no life. That's cool.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:38.080]   If you found it out. But using it in those ways as you laid out, those are practical things that I
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:43.200]   want and interest me. There's real hope of like, we know there's an exoplanet. It was like,
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.880]   "Okay, but is it a rock? Does it have an atmosphere?" And we don't know. And they think they're going to
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:53.200]   be able to use web to do spectrographs of the atmosphere of exoplanets and say, "This has got
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.000]   an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere like Earth." Or, "This is more like a Jupiter." And they hope to be able
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.600]   to do that with this. I'm all in on in that. Pretty sweet. All in, you got me. Hey,
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.160]   you all from me some crack cocaine. I took it.
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.360]   Lee Fonkertle.
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:10.880]   The optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Flight Space Center said,
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:15.600]   "We said last fall, we would know that the telescope is working properly when we have an image of a
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.880]   star that looks like a star. Now we're seeing that image." And I'm happy to say the optical
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:26.480]   performance of the telescope is absolutely phenomenal. It is working extremely well.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.480]   The performance is as good, if not better, than our most optimistic prediction.
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:34.800]   Yeah. It's summer before we'll get official science images because they have a bunch of...
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:40.080]   This is one camera. And so they've aligned the mirror, but now they also have to align. And
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:47.040]   it's so precise because these are so delicate. And it's behind their sunshield out in fairly deep
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:54.000]   space. It's at the range point. But once they fine-tune all the instruments, starting the summer,
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:54.960]   the science starts to roll.
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:02.160]   It's just the simple... You think it's tough upgrading a laptop or something like that.
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.840]   They built this thing, put it in a vibration chamber and shook it,
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:11.600]   shook it violently to simulate a launch, then took it down, rebuilt everything which failed,
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:16.160]   then did the same thing after chilling it for three weeks using liquid nitrogen,
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:18.240]   and then did the whole thing again. It's a marvellous...
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:19.680]   And then shot it into space.
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:26.240]   And nobody can't be fixed. It's too far away. So if anything fails,
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:29.360]   the whole billions of dollars is down the drain and it all worked.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:34.800]   This is a graph from the Recording Industry Association of America. You might need the
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:41.200]   web telescope to see the very last bar, which is CD sales in the year 2020-21.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:46.160]   But you may notice something. It went up. It went up. It went up by a lot. I mean, look,
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.480]   CD sales are still a fraction of the CD sales 20 years ago. But for the first time in a long time,
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:18:01.040]   shipments of CDs rose from 31 million in 2020 to 46 million in 2021.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:03.920]   No, our hipster is going to be listening to CDs like the other five.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:05.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:10.000]   I was going to say it literally is hipster CD buyers. It's the same thing as records.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:10.640]   Records are...
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:13.520]   Vinyl sales have been steadily increasing for a decade and a half.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.120]   Yeah. But they're taking up too much space. They realize they can just stack up CDs.
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:17.760]   But listen to this.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:18.160]   But listen to this.
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:18.800]   And have the same...
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:22.400]   So CD's 46 million CDs were sold last year.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:27.360]   39 million vinyl records were sold last year. Almost as many.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:33.360]   Some of that is... Because I've got a family member who works at work to Abbey Road.
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:38.720]   But he was saying that a lot of the vinyl stuff that they're selling now
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.400]   is people buying albums to get framed up and put on the wall.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.360]   They're not listening to them.
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:47.680]   Yeah.
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:48.240]   It's...
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:49.360]   There's some truth.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:52.400]   But any... I'm on some mailing list for some of my favorite musical artists.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:54.480]   And they all do a vinyl release.
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.000]   And it's limited editions.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.240]   And it goes for the fan club and it costs a fortune.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:18:59.200]   And you can't...
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.920]   You're a touring musician.
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.040]   You've got a mailing list.
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:04.080]   You do your tour.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:05.120]   You sell vinyl.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:05.680]   These are all...
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:06.720]   You've got to do it all.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:08.240]   And apparently the vinyl is really cool now.
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.200]   Like 21st century vinyl can be like weird colors and weird patterns and stuff.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:14.640]   What you buy them freely.
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:15.680]   You buy unfreely MacGee vinyl records.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.320]   Yeah, you do.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:16.880]   Yeah.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:18.640]   And they bet they're all like spacey...
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:19.600]   You know?
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:20.000]   Yeah.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.640]   And they're collectable because they don't mass produce them.
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:23.840]   And so people have to get them.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.280]   They're like NFTs that you play music.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:26.320]   It's like an FQ can hold.
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.000]   It's an NFT you can hold and play.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:28.800]   And so...
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:29.440]   And so it's an interesting...
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:32.240]   It's an interesting just to think who is the top seller.
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:34.240]   So Adele, Taylor Swift,
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.240]   Taylor Swift again, Taylor Swift again.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:36.560]   Yeah.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.080]   Billie Eilish tops.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.000]   So people with strong fan bases.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:40.480]   Yes.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:40.800]   Yes.
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.440]   They want to fizz...
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:41.840]   You know what?
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:42.400]   They want to fizz it.
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:43.360]   When you're at a concert...
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:43.600]   Yeah.
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:44.400]   Again, Mr.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:45.600]   You don't believe in NFTs.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:48.080]   Music is my gonna NFT because you can't hold it anymore.
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.840]   It's digital but it's there.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.400]   But guess what?
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.600]   When I go to the concert and I see Billie Eilish and I wanted to sign something.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:56.880]   I can't have her sign my phone that's streaming her music.
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:58.000]   Let me hold up the CD.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.600]   And some people sign it.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.160]   I used to sign autographs a couple of years.
[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.840]   And nobody asked for autographs anymore.
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:04.800]   They just want a selfie.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:05.680]   That's all anybody wants.
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.720]   Nobody wants an autograph.
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.560]   Because I can hold it and it's the only one.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:08.640]   A selfie.
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:09.520]   I don't know.
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:11.280]   Last butly brag concert I went to.
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.320]   Did you get an autograph?
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:12.960]   Ah, yeah.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:13.680]   I got my CD.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:14.480]   You all got autographed.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:17.040]   And you just said you cannot sign a digital copy.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:18.000]   That's true.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:18.640]   That's true.
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.280]   So yeah.
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.880]   I got my t-shirt signed and I got my CD signed and I was a very happy camper.
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:23.920]   Just waiting on you Leo.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:26.320]   Just waiting on you Leo.
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:26.720]   Still waiting.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.520]   You got me waiting a long time.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.720]   But you know what's not gonna wait?
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.680]   Our dinner reservation.
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:30.800]   Let's get the hell out of here.
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:32.640]   Well, let's look at the latest on Fries McGee album.
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:33.360]   First.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:33.840]   First.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.280]   Here's the M-Fries McGee album.
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:35.760]   Ask me for a friend.
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:36.160]   Two open.
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:36.720]   Wow.
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:37.920]   Cloud Lux edition.
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:38.640]   How much is that?
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:39.440]   50 bucks?
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:40.000]   See.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.760]   100 bucks if you want all three of those three pictures that come with it.
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:46.240]   And it's gonna look how pretty it is.
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:46.720]   It's pretty.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:49.280]   In a world where all of the stuff is digital downloads,
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:50.640]   not only does it make sense for the artist,
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:54.480]   it totally makes sense if you want like a thing to show your love of the artist.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:54.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.440]   You get this one.
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:56.320]   It's like a t-shirt.
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:56.640]   Yeah.
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:58.320]   And that's great.
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.160]   John, do you have a turntable?
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:01.040]   I do not.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:02.560]   No, he doesn't have a turntable.
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:03.440]   He has all the volume.
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:04.640]   You know, there's that song.
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.280]   Yes, no way.
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:06.080]   Have you heard that song?
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:09.200]   It's like, I've got a record player that was made in 2015.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.760]   And I'm like, that's so weird.
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:14.640]   Like 20 first.
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:17.040]   I hope it's like, is it like a USB record player?
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:17.520]   What is it?
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.240]   I don't even know.
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:18.960]   Ooh.
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:20.880]   But the hipsters, they love it.
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.000]   It's warmer.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:22.960]   It sounds warmer.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.320]   Jason Snell, six colors.com.com.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:26.800]   We love it.
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:28.400]   That's a lot of money for that domain.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:28.880]   Did you?
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:29.360]   I did.
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.240]   No, really?
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:30.640]   I did.
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:32.800]   It was like four or five grand when I was starting to sign it.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.320]   And I was like, oh, I got to get it.
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:34.960]   I got to get it.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:39.360]   If you are an Apple fan, Jason and Dan are the kings of this.
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:41.360]   And boy, lots of great articles.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:41.840]   We'll help you out.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.880]   Lots of information.
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:45.440]   It really is a great site.
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:46.320]   You've done a great job.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.320]   And of course, how many podcasts do you do?
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:49.120]   A lot.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:50.480]   A lot.
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:53.120]   Been upgrade on Relaf M as a big one downstream.
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:56.800]   If you're interested in my thoughts about the streaming world.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:58.320]   Absolutely uncomfortable.
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:21:59.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:00.880]   Very busy man.
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.240]   But I'm so glad to see you.
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:03.680]   It's great to see you anytime.
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:04.240]   Really wonderful.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.200]   It's an easy drive for me.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:08.000]   But I'm usually it's you and me and a bunch of you.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.040]   A bunch of avatars.
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:09.440]   Yeah.
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.240]   Yeah.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.040]   Not today.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.840]   We had Ian Thompson from the register.com.
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:14.400]   Indeed.
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.040]   Great to see you.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:15.440]   Great to see you.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:16.320]   Good to see you as well.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:16.880]   It's been a while.
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.000]   It used to be more fun to come here because we had an English food store.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:20.880]   But that's fine.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:21.920]   Yeah, that has gone.
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:24.800]   In fact, a lot of the English food stores have gone to the wall.
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:25.920]   People realize it's crap.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:29.280]   I think I would beg to differ with that.
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:31.120]   I know you've never got on with Marmite.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:32.720]   I really think you should give it a shot.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:33.520]   Nobody wants it.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.240]   No, no, no.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.240]   I'll have a Scotch egg tonight.
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:39.120]   That's what we'll do.
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.600]   Yes.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.160]   Yeah.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:41.120]   Thank you for being here.
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:41.680]   Really appreciate it.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:42.480]   It was a pleasure.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.480]   And Owen J. J. Stone came all the way out from his undisclosed location
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:47.360]   somewhere back east.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.200]   It is so nice to have you.
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:50.080]   You didn't bring Leah this time.
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:50.480]   I did not.
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.480]   She's very upset with me and she misses you guys.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.160]   So next time I guess I have to bring her.
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:55.120]   We had a good time with her.
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:57.840]   I will say it's my fault that this absolutely happened.
[02:22:57.840 --> 02:22:59.280]   I'm glad it is my fault.
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:00.800]   If you're out there in the world,
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:01.680]   just know two things.
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.800]   One, the chat room here is like the best chat room in America.
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.600]   And the discord is talk about NFTs you can hold,
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:10.240]   the gifts that are going on currently live during show.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:11.120]   They know how to find something.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:11.680]   It is rocking.
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:12.960]   I sold the post.
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.080]   There we go.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:20.080]   Post sold NFTs that you can hold during the show live is really a great community.
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.880]   And if you're in that community and if you want to be in that community,
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:26.640]   also make sure you reach out to Lisa and to Leo and to anyone that will listen
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:29.920]   and tell this man to start selling or giving away NFTs
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.280]   to clubhouse holders.
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.080]   I wanted to happen.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:32.800]   I wanted to be a thing.
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:35.040]   I want to be a champion and a king in the future.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:40.240]   And 10 years down the line, you can look back and thank me for the $4 that you made from the NFT
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:42.080]   that you got for free for being a club member.
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:42.960]   I appreciate you.
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:43.600]   I love you.
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:44.720]   It's been a great time.
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:45.760]   Text me, send me a message.
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.640]   I don't spam you.
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:47.840]   And I'm back to doing shows too.
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:50.640]   If you like podcasts with a crazy person that rents about things
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:51.840]   and I do a show up my kid too.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:52.480]   I love you.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.280]   And another Twit.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.800]   Isn't it a kid?
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.440]   Yeah!
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:58.400]   [MUSIC]
