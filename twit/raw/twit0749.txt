[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   edition. As you can see, we've decorated the studio and we've brought in some very festive
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   people starting with Oh, Dr. Owen, JJ Stone. Hello, Owen. Oh, so far, new people. You've
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.920]   got Spaggin' Al for the holiday. See through headphones. That's nice. Battle and headphones.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.400]   I'm wearing a shirt for your Uncle Leo. What does the shirt say? Okay, Boomer. Oh, crap.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.360]   Ah, just in case you get out of line. I got a bunch of millennials on the show today.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.640]   I'm in deep doo-doo. Am I a gen? Am I a gen Y? I'm not a millennial. See, people get lazy.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.680]   They skip my whole generation. I think I'm a gen Y. I was 179. Yeah, we don't care. Yeah,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   we're not a millennial. You're nothing. You're in the middle. Okay, Boomer. Okay. Exactly.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.760]   All right, but I have, I do have some other millennials on here. Paris Martino is here.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   Always a thrill to have Paris on. She's from Wired. Hi, Paris. Hey, great to have you.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.600]   Thanks so much for having me, Boomer. It's going to go on all day, isn't it? All night.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.240]   I don't mind, okay, Boomer, because we kind of, we baby Boomer screwed the world up and
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.480]   you're continuing to screw the world up. So we kind of do is just like kind of ribby about it.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   Wall to the Auburn. Yeah, we can own it. We can own it. Thank you for being here, Paris.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.640]   And also, it's the first time on Twitch, she's been on our shows before,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.400]   but I'm thrilled to get her on the news round table, Rosemary Orchard. Hi, thank you for having me.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.560]   She is a brilliant coder and a podcaster on the Relay FM network. And you were on our iOS today
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.160]   show when I was there to talk about automation and shortcuts and so forth. She calls herself
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.720]   a productivity geek. Well, I mean, automation slash productivity geek slash very good at
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.800]   procrastination in old forms. You know, isn't that funny that people who are good at,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   to do lists and stuff are the worst. So I guess it's self-defense.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.040]   Must be. Yeah. Automators podcast, nested folders podcast and at rosmerry orchard.com.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.080]   Wonderful to have you. Are Rosemary, are you running out to buy the new Mac Pro? I think
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.840]   your, your automators will run so fast on that Mac Pro. Yeah, I got a new Mac mini in July this year.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   And I somehow twisted Stephen Heckett's arm. So he actually upgraded my RAM for me,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   which is something I was going to be following YouTube videos to do myself.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.520]   But I don't feel like I need a Mac Pro because my Mac mini is pretty darn powerful. It does
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.400]   everything I needed to do. And the application, which theoretically would use the most RAM is
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.000]   screen flow. And that crashes when it's over a two gigabyte file anyway. So for me, the Mac Pro
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   is a beautiful to look at machine and it could be in an art gallery. Because that's as useful as
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.920]   it will be to me. And it's actually less expensive than a massive painting would be only the top of
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:20.160]   the line Mac Pro, $52,599. That's one third of a banana tape tool. And you can't eat it.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.600]   I mean, you could try. I wonder if they would say the empty casing to use his artwork.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.960]   The empty case is beautiful. I think the last one of the last Johnny I've designed, I think. Yeah.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.760]   It is awfully expensive. The wheels alone are $400. Of course, you don't have to have wheels
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.320]   unless you want to roll it around. The monitor adds another $6,000 if you want the stand.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.520]   So a number of-- So then if you want the special coating. Oh, and if you want the nano coating,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.320]   another $1,000. But be careful if you buy the nano coating, you have to use the included special
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.920]   cloth to clean it. So, you know, and I don't think those are-- That cloth is available in stores.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   The cloth is one of those things that makes me worry a little bit because people always buy
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.640]   these really beautiful, lovely, brand new MacBook Pros and then they go and they buy the cheapest
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.560]   possible bag or case to put it in. It's like you just spent $5,000 all laptop and you are quibbling
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.920]   over whether you spend 50 or 75 bucks on a backpack for it. Like just spend the more money to get the
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.440]   right equipment to protect it. I mean, if you are using the special coating, I'm sure it's very
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.360]   fancy. I don't know why this cloth is so special. Like nobody seems to really know, but I can't think
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.680]   it would hurt to just do what Apple suggests to in this case. Oh, don't take that. I think that
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.600]   might fall under the line of imagination. You just tell people they need a special cloth and they
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.800]   get it. And anybody who spent in sixth-grand on a monitor could really give a hoot or any about
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.880]   protection because once you're throwing that kind of money around, I mean, are you even cleaning your
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.040]   own monitors? Aren't you paying somebody to do it? Well, you have somebody to do it. I thought to
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.800]   myself, it'd be a better investment for me to pay somebody $10,000 to camp outside Uncle Leo's
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.840]   business to rob twits of a $52,000 machine that it would be to spend $60,000. I am not buying--
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.360]   There is no Mac Pro in my future. I am not buying that one. I was stupid enough to buy the 2013
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.160]   trashcan Mac. Oh, yeah. It's half a Tesla. Come on, baby. You don't know. It's cheap. I know. It's half a
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.680]   Tesla. And guess what? That Tesla all it does is drive you around. Okay, you're over here doing live
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.520]   podcast 24-cent. I need it. You need this machine. I need this machine from you. You can come and
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   need it. I need it. I need to get a second machine, read the liver next week. Come on. I don't know
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.480]   anybody who's bought one yet, but I do know a number of reviewers have-- I just seen
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.280]   got hers again, a loner from Apple and did a lovely unboxing. In fact, she just tweeted today. She's
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   been using her-- she did the unboxing. She shot it with three red cameras. So she has an 8K video,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.200]   and she just tweeted editing the three-- Let me show you this, Karsten, instead. We saw the
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:25.440]   unboxing before, but this is her tweet of all of the 64 cores maxed out. And look at it. It's about
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:34.240]   one frame every few seconds. It says, "Oh my God." So this is a good-- to me, a good reason not to edit
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:45.920]   8K. Mark has Brownlee got one as well. Jonathan Morrison. I think Jonathan shot his unboxing video
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.240]   with an Alexa-- Area Alexa camera, which is a very high-end cinema camera for movies.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.280]   Vince Florey, who will actually use it, I think. Vincent La Florey is one of the best photographers
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.160]   ever. There's a lot of aerial photography. When I interviewed him a few-- a couple of years ago,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.920]   I asked him, "Come on, you shot the drone footage for Apple's TV screensavers." And he would
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   neither confirm nor deny, which tells me he did it. So he's obviously doing some high-end stuff for
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.120]   Apple. His review is a text review. He says, "The Mac Pro is actually fun to work on. It feels like
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:31.920]   it works with you, not against you." Yeah, well. So I mean, I assumed that this is amazing. Last weekend,
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:40.240]   I rented the Panasonic SH1 or S1H, and it shoots in 6K. That's a nice,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.760]   huge video camera. Yes. I got it from lens rentals because I wanted to see it before I
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   bought it, before I dropped another 4-gram on camera. And it's phenomenal. In the dark,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   it is the best low-light camera I've ever had in my hands. I've never had a red or anything crazy.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:03.360]   But the file size was ungodly. And I'm used to shooting on my Canon EOS-R in ProRes 10-bit.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.840]   And that's manageable. But once you get up to 6K and 8K, I just don't have room to store it.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.160]   So unless you're really making movies or doing high-end professional work,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.880]   I don't know if you need this computer. I'm over here balling on a budget with my rising chips.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.440]   And I rendered my 6K just fine. I mean, I went out, I made the sandwich. I came back.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.480]   My 4 minutes of video was done. I went out, I watched the movie. I came back. My half hour
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.840]   of edits were done. So I mean, I get that this machine is all world. But to get it to be all world,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.480]   it's $60,000. Because there's no way in the world I'm blowing 52 Gs and not getting that
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.560]   nanomegabyte trinotron screen. There's no way in the world I'm going to be on the regular screen.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.480]   So you got to spend 60 Gs to be fully maxed out. I'm going to show you this. I'll mute him.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:55.600]   I'm going to show you this video from Spazzy Labs, where he did a rise in to compete with the Mac
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.640]   Pro. And he believes he got actually faster performance. This is a hackintosh. And of course,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   no serious filmmaker, music maker, photographer is going to use a hackintosh because, you know,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   one update and all that goes away. But it does look pretty. It does look pretty. And he was able
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.240]   to those rising chips. In a way, I feel like Apple, because they're sticking with Intel,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.160]   is a little behind the curve because AMD's risins have, you know, they're going to have a 64 core
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:32.480]   rise in later this year in 2020. So it's, I don't know. Like I said, I'm not, I'm not doing 8k and I've
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:40.160]   never even edited anything 8k. But 6k with that Panasonic was a huge file. And I was still living
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   the dream, editing stuff. So I get like for professionals, but for that amount of money,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.280]   I'm like, you better be making yeah, movies from the future. I assume I just need is coming back
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:57.200]   from 2022 to release the videos. These videos are going to end up on YouTube,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:07.040]   where it crushed, it'll say a K, but yeah, one EDP. Yeah. So we, you know, I bet you you could
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   fool people. Our video releases are HD. And I'm going to put that in air quotes because it's 720p,
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.000]   which is the worst HD you can get. But it's more than enough. And even on a big screen, this looks
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.720]   fine. There is a Linus Tech Tips released an 8k, you'll log video on YouTube. And I don't, I don't,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.560]   we have a lot of bandwidth here. This is these, you know, high quality monitors and everything.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:44.400]   I go, can you tell that this is 8k, this 8k, you'll log? No, no, it's all depends on the screen.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.600]   You've got right. If you go to 720p screen, an 8k video is not going to be better than a 720p.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.320]   But even if you have, well, first of all, no one has an 8k screen. I guess you might have an 8k
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.720]   monitor. Dude, are there any? That's the life case, the biggest I've got.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.360]   What 2% of the population? I mean, again, I get for professionals, I get, I mean, I would,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.640]   I would, I might think about killing somebody from his computer. I wouldn't do it. But I think
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.680]   about for 30 seconds. Think about it. You're ripping off your good buddy, Leo.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.360]   So all right. All right. All right. Here's, here's, I'm going to show you that this is silly because,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.200]   but this is the 720p version of this video. And I'm going to turn it. Well, of course, you can't,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.760]   because you're looking on Skype. Here's the 8k version. Let's see if it even loads. Oh, there it is.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   Oh, look how much better that looks. But does it look 8k better?
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:41.600]   A thousand dollars. A lot of your favorite YouTubers are upscaling 1080 to 2k or 4k just for YouTube.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.280]   And it still looks great. Like you hear people talk about that all the time. And of course,
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.120]   they downscaled their 4k to 1080 just because it makes the 1080 look so much more vibrant. So,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   I mean, again, you're here professional and you got the money to go. Let's get it.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   Movies aren't 8k. Nope. There is the chat room is rolling. Tell me in the chat room that there's
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   a 8k Dell monitor. Let me just see how much this has set me back. Oh, it's only $5,000, 32 inch,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.040]   8-inch. How much content are you ever going to be considering in a, I mean, the amount that is ever
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:22.160]   out there is going to, it's going to be very little and effectively, I mean, most of the time,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   you're not going to be looking at something that is going to be doing that expensive screen
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:32.720]   justice. This is also, I feel that 8k television. It's like, okay, sure. I guess I could have a TV
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.840]   that has this option, but really is the stuff that I'm going to be watching every other day
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.560]   going to be available in that quality. Probably not. An HDTV is just fine.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.560]   A lot of pressure on NHK, the Japanese broadcaster from the Japanese government,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.760]   they're pushing hard 8k Olympics in Tokyo this summer and they'll be shooting in an 8k and
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.120]   broadcasting it. I guess only in Japan will you be able to see it. I think there are some 8k
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:08.640]   televisions. We'll see 8k TVs at CES. I remember the first 4k I saw years ago at CES and I thought,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.280]   wow, this is like looking through a window. And so we don't get yelled at by people later on.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   The benefit of shooting an 8k or 6k or 4k is the fact that you can crop in. I shot a cast from a show
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.640]   and there were eight people on set. That's why I rented the S1H and I could zoom in on each
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   individual person and have met like a full 1080 from a 6k. So again, even though things aren't always
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   displayed in 8k, the reason you shoot with 8k is so you could crop and cut in for those reasons
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.320]   and we fully understand that. I'm going to be shooting when we go to CES. I'm going to shoot it on my
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:49.840]   Sony A7, which is a still camera, but it shoots 4k video and I'll shoot 4k video. My
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.320]   our editors told me this is what we want you to do. Shoot 4k video, single camera,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.280]   wide angle and then we can crop in because that means that 4k is 4 1080p screens. So we can crop
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.760]   in, we can zoom. It'll be like you have four cameras and if you do it wide, you'll be able to get a
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.240]   lot of the scene and we can go wide and then go close and all that stuff. So there's definitely
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.000]   advantages to that and I'm not knocking the Mac Pro and I'm not knocking somebody shooting an
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   8k. Mostly I'm pointing out that this is a computer for the 1% of the 1%. This is a very,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   this is a small market and even we do video production every day and I wouldn't dream of
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.360]   spending that much money on it. The people that are really going to love this or the guys doing
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.320]   Marvel CGI, you know, like back in the day when they did the Matrix and it took them like 400
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.520]   computers and like a team of 82 people to do the graphics. Like I assume something like this
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.480]   is what those people are salivating over having a cluster on wheels. These
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.920]   machines rolling around doing all the dirty work forms. So again, there seems to be it.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   There's always been in the gadget world and the tech world kind of this.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:07.520]   How high end can you make it? How fast can you make it for money or no object?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:15.040]   And clearly that's what Apple is doing. But do you think it, Rosemary, does it forward?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.120]   Does is the advantage of Apple making this that it will then forward everything else Apple does?
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.360]   Like in two years we'll get better Macs because of this.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.240]   I think it's entirely possible that we'll get those better Macs in two years. But also,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.880]   I feel that Apple lost a lot of their pro market or at least a lot of people thought about leaving
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.560]   because the computers just weren't there. There was nothing that could do this stuff for those
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.480]   professionals who are out there doing graphics for films and things like that, CGI and things.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.280]   But haven't they lost those? I mean, they lost us when they screwed up Final Cut and they put
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.200]   out that trash can Mac. We moved to premiere on Windows. All of our editors, the workstations
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.600]   are Dell Precision, workstations running Windows 10 and premiere. And I wonder if, I mean, I'm not
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.320]   going to move back to Mac now. Haven't they lost a lot of those people over the last five years?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.600]   I mean, maybe, but maybe some people are still hanging in there with their pre-trashcans,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.080]   their cheese graters, their old cheese graters. I don't know. But I do know that this is one of
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.800]   those things that I think is as much a design challenge and a what can we do with this kind of thing.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.760]   And I've seen quite a few people complaining on Twitter that this is not something that's really
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   affordable for the masses. And I don't think it's designed to be that. I think it is one of those.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.720]   Let's try doing a Mac where people can take parts out and put parts in. Are these still going to
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.400]   bring it to the Genius Bar? Right. Because you paid $52,000 for a computer. You're going to take it
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.480]   somewhere and expect somebody else to take this thing out, remove the dust and put it back in for
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.720]   you. Definitely not opening this up myself, even though it does open beautifully.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   You know, in a way, I think I don't mean to bang to bang on Apple because I applaud the fact that
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   they said, well, what if the cost or no object? What's the best thing we could do? And I think
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.800]   that that's great. I just wonder what's the value to the rest of us. And the rest of us, in this case,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:27.360]   is 99.99% of Macintosh and computer users. So maybe there's some value in that they're pushing
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.760]   the limits and that will someday get something like that. Or maybe, I don't know, maybe not.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.400]   You already have a Mac mini that was the most affordable Mac and it does everything you want it
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.480]   to do. Yeah, I mean, I can produce video on that. I wouldn't say that I'm producing high-end video.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   I'm certainly not producing things in 4K, but it's doing everything I need it to do. And it will be
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:56.800]   able to do more in the future as my needs increase. Right. There are also a lot of accessories in the
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   Apple store specifically for this Mac Pro. And as one might imagine, they're expensive, including a
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:13.520]   $1,000 webcam from Logitech. Because of course, if you have a monitor cable doing a K video,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.280]   you need a 4K webcam. I'm interested in seeing that actually. I want to see how that looks.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:27.680]   Maybe this is really the truth is that 8K is coming and that 4K, even a few years ago,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:35.200]   was kind of like 8K is today. And it's here for sure. The webcam is only $200, actually.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.040]   Oh, it's only $200. It's cheap. It's cheap. That's true.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.640]   And that two of them. And that's why I'm interested to see how it works. Because normally when you
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.960]   see the 4K webcams are crap, but I mean, we'll see. Really? I have the pre-runner to this version
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.640]   running right now. That's what I'm using at this moment. I find it looks great. It looks great.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.600]   Web camera. It does not have a Mac note on the bottom of it, but it has a stand and it's sitting
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.080]   on top of my MacBook Air and it works great. So it looks fantastic. I'm using the same one. Yeah.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.680]   Oh my God. Logitech cameras sitting on top of my Mac, but right now. Okay. Yeah, the images are
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.560]   fantastic, actually. This is the funny thing. I mean, here we are. We're doing a show.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.760]   Most people listen to it, but we're doing a show with video. I'm the only one in the studio.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:24.160]   Everybody else is Rosemary. You're in the UK, right? Actually, I'm in Vienna. Vienna.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.840]   I'm a little bit further east. Even better. She's in Austria and you could be sitting right next to
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.480]   me. The picture is great. Paris is in Brooklyn. The picture looks great. I don't know where the
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.520]   Hello, doctors, but see, I'm I'm rocking right now, I'm rocking a thousand dollar webcam because
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   I'm using my I use my Canon 80 D. Yeah, that's good. That's my webcam. That's good. And then,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.720]   you know, if I wanted to bump up and use the EOS R I got that cam 4K link. I got that on there,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.400]   too. But I think that's overkill. I really can't tell the difference. I look at just as ugly and
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.640]   4K on a webcam as I do in 1080. So I just keep using the 80 D. I mean, I bought this is actually
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.280]   $200 here, too, but I could do it. I could upgrade Uncle Leo if you needed me to look worse.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.240]   It is kind of amazing, actually, that we are able to do this with people all over the world,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.480]   via Skype, and it looks great. One of the reasons that we put you around a table in these TV
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.200]   screens, we call Mavatars, so it feels like we're almost sitting around the table together.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.280]   We have, I mean, I don't want to take for granted the amazing technology. And honestly,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.160]   the technology that you see in the Mac Pro is it's great because it's pushing the envelope,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.480]   and then will eventually come down the road to us at a Blightsoe Bloor price.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:45.600]   I mean, again, we you can configure it. You don't need to get to get the $50,000 machine.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:52.960]   I was playing around with it feasibly in my mind, which I'm not going to do. I was like,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   I can get away with like $12,000 and be really, really happy. But then I look at my computer that
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.000]   I built and I just keep upgrading myself. Like, I just bought the new Ryzen 3 processor, which was
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   $1,000. And again, this thing is doing 4K renders. I got over 100 gigs of RAM. I don't really know
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.960]   what more $9,000 is going to get me in a Mac.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:25.440]   Apple TV, very loudly touting that they won their first award nomination, a Golden Globe award.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.080]   Actually, they got the Critics' Choice Award. They got a Golden Globe nomination for the morning
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:39.520]   show, Billy Crudup, who plays the network, Goon, got Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.480]   beating out Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones and Asante Black. And this is us.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   I don't know how important the Critics' Choice Awards are, but Apple's very happy.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.360]   I have to say, I think we have one more episode of the morning show and I've yet to be
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   captured by it. But it's a yeoman-like effort. Is Apple TV+ doing well? Do you think, compared to
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.120]   something like Disney+ and the Mandalorian and the existing incumbents? What do you think?
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.680]   Well, Apple TV+ wins in Austria because it's here, whereas Disney+ is not.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.440]   That was a big deal. They launched this in, I think, 100 countries at launch. That was an amazing
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   feat. Yeah. Have you been watching it, Rosemary?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.840]   I've been watching the morning show. I just watched the episode with a singing
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.640]   that was screenshotted in the article. So I'm not sure how long I am yet.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.560]   Not long I'm around. I'm enjoying it.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:42.080]   Yeah, what countries is it available in? 106 countries. That's unheard of in a launch
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.920]   of a product like this. I don't even think Netflix is an honestly.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.960]   For a streaming show. I feel like the offer is generally pretty very... I have not watched a single
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:59.200]   second of Apple TV+ and I'm all right with that. You've been off to be honest with you.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.560]   There's only so many streaming services that I can subscribe to at one given point and I have
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   made my bed with whatever I have loaded on my Roku right now.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.720]   Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, I'm tapped out.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.520]   What do you think Rosemary? Should they run out and buy Apple TV+?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.760]   I mean, I don't think it's something that is necessarily worth paying for yet,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.280]   but if you get a new device, then you get a year of it included.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.680]   You got it with your Mac mini. I got it with my watch or my TV. No, I guess my iPhone, I got it.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.760]   Yeah, I got it with my iPhone and I stopped having it by the deterrent on you.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.680]   Like I could care less. Like if you have anything on there that's used for me to see,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.960]   this first time I've ever heard about this show. I haven't heard anything about Apple's plus TV
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.760]   shows. I'm never going to hear anything about them. So whoop-dee-doo. Like you said, I got Netflix
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.880]   about to get Nickelodeon on. We about to have a battle with Disney+. I'm about to have my whole
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.000]   dream come to be in the child. You have to have Disney+.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.160]   So, I mean, I am not on Disney+. I refuse to spend more money and I wait for somebody to throw me
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.920]   a passcode so I can see the Mandalorian. You got to ask that guy who's selling the fire TV sticks
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.880]   in your girl's soccer game. Oh, yeah. Not a bright guy. He definitely doesn't know. It's not
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.240]   softball season. I can definitely get to him. My thought process was I'm going to wait till the
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.760]   Mandalorian is over. I'm going to do my seven-day free trial. There you go.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.240]   Go to Mandalorian. And all on. Yeah. Because I still got all my Disney stuff. I got duck tails.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.160]   I got dark wind. I got all that stuff on DVD and Blu-ray. So, I mean, they ain't getting me yet.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.240]   They got to come up with something to get me dip my toe in the water.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.360]   Here's an amazing stat. Well, and then we'll wrap up the Apple News and move on because there's
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.960]   lots of other things to talk about. Horace Teddayou, who does a great job at Asymco. He's an analyst,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:58.160]   but he's a smart guy. He tries to read the tea leaves because Apple doesn't announce how well
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.320]   any individual product does. They stopped selling, you know, talking about sell-through.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:10.640]   But he did some analysis on what Apple was quoting for its non-watch wearables and home.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:17.120]   And by subtracting what he believes the Apple Watch contributed to that revenue.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:25.360]   He estimates that get this AirPods, and I presume that's AirPods and AirPods Pro,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:35.280]   are a $4 billion quarter business for Apple, a quarter in three months for billion dollars.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:42.240]   That's better selling than the iPod ever was. I believe that.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.880]   It feels like everybody I know has gotten AirPods in the past year.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.480]   I am saying them everywhere. Even in Vienna, you see them everywhere.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.520]   Yeah, when the AirPods first came out, there were a couple of people who I would run into
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.080]   on the tram in the morning. We did like, "Oh yeah, you have AirPods too. Look at each other and not
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.680]   type thing." And occasionally it was the same kind of thing with the Apple Watch. The first few
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   people, it was like, "Oh, I found somebody who actually understands why this is cool and useful."
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.200]   But now everybody's wearing AirPods or AirPods Pro. I'm seeing fewer AirPods Pro than I am seeing
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   AirPods, but they're also shorter and it's winter, so everyone's wearing a hat.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.640]   You know what the cool thing about that is? Apple did a good thing and then they fixed their
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.280]   problem. You come out with AirPods, and then a few people get them. Then you come out with the
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.080]   AirPods too. And all my friends got their kids, the original version because the price went down.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.640]   But the kids in the school can't tell if they're version one versus two. So you got the hookup for
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.120]   $79, you kid thinks they're cool, and everybody's happy. Then they come out with the B's Pro,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.720]   and I'm rocking those. Everybody's like, "Oh, what a doa, da, da, da." And then they come out with the
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.920]   AirPods Pro and now people know you ain't got money again. They like looking for you.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.560]   Yeah, you can't afford $60. My daughter looked at me and she's like, "Dad, I'm like,
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.920]   I will throw you out of a window if you don't just keep rocking these AirPods. I got you because
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.600]   I bought myself, but they don't fit my ears." But these kids, they know they're on it. So
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.920]   I could see them selling them, making money. Again, because a lot of people could buy the cheaper
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.960]   version and not feel bad about themselves like you do at Apple. Do you have three cameras on
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:26.160]   your phone? Oh, you're a loser. Look at you, you're a loser. Rosemary, it's so romantic to hear you
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.760]   say as you ride the tram in Vienna, are they still horse-drawn now or do they have electric
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.160]   trams? I'm just curious. They're all electric, but there are some that are still like the old
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.000]   style where you climb up the stairs to get into them and they have wooden seats. It's like Dr.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Chicago, right? I mean, it's like, it's really just, and then you feel like, well, if you're riding the
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.720]   tram to go have soccer tort in Vienna, you shouldn't be using any technology at all. You should just
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.160]   throw those AirPods out the window. You say that until you sit in front of the heater,
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.400]   at which point you're like, "Oh, wow, this tram really does contain technology." Those heaters?
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.840]   Wow, they're fancy heaters, huh? They're just really powerful. I have no idea what they do with them.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.560]   You sit in front of them and you roast like a chestnut.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:18.640]   That's Rosemary Orchard, our favorite chestnut. Rosemary Orchard.com. She's in Vienna, Paris Mart.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   No, I was right. You're in Brooklyn, right? Paris, I seem to remember that.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.000]   Yep, I am. Yeah. I found a way to get an Ethernet connection here in my home.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.400]   Nice. The trains are flying to my office today.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.960]   Why aren't the trains running? Is there a big strike?
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:39.360]   No, it's just the AC line. For some reason, this weekend, they just decided to not run them in
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:46.400]   Brooklyn for three whole days. I've just stayed at home. Are you using the microphones in your
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:54.000]   bows? I'm using my microphones in my bows. At first, I was trying to do the Logitech one,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.880]   because that's normally pretty good. I'm in a small, upstairs living room that I have, and
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.600]   the heater sometimes goes on and off. That's good. We don't hear the heater, so that's good.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:11.920]   Oh, Doctor, who's in his secret lair somewhere in the Atlantic States. What is the button with
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.400]   the okay boomer? I got it. I got it. Okay, boomer. I got it. He's wearing an okay boomer
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:22.000]   t-shirt, but what's the button? Is that like an astronaut? No, that's my raising a ninja button
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.960]   from my podcast with my daughter. Oh, that's your logo. Yeah, that's my logo for the pocket.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:33.760]   Oh, I got another one too. I got my blacked out, oh, doctor buttons. My black ops, oh, doctor
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:40.160]   buzz. I got swag Uncle Leo. I just searched on Google for raising a ninja, and I got a
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.840]   recipe for making oatmeal raisin cookies in a ninja blender. I think that's good.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:55.440]   I think that's delicious. I think that's not the point. There it is. Iqmz.com.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.560]   There that is a great that is father and daughter ninjas. I love it. Yeah, we uh, we do a podcast
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.640]   together. It's very interesting. She hasn't quit doing it on me yet. We're so after the holidays,
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.560]   we're going to get back to it. How an ambassador enough. I'm trying to hold. Is Alia now?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:18.160]   She is 12 going on 42. Yikes. Russell season just started. So, you know, we're back at it.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.480]   You're entering the the dangerous years. People say that, but I'll tell you real quick, you know
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.120]   what I mean? She's talking to boys, boys like her, but they're scared to death of her. You know
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.840]   what I mean? It's just great. Like she said, she was walking through the high school and the high
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.760]   school was a high five in her because they know we're in the streets because she won championships
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.640]   and tournaments. So I'm, I'm not worried. Uncle, don't scare me. I got a what is she champion in?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.720]   Oh, she came in. Well, she came in third and girls in the, in the county last year and she came
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.600]   in fourth and boys. She was right out of the top three. So she won a lot of matches last year,
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.000]   and she's only getting better. And like I said, I can't be there to protect her all the time.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.600]   She's always getting A's and B's. I just realized I didn't check her grades for the last two years
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.880]   because I'm a horrible parent. And I said, Oh, you got your poor car. What? She's like,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.280]   I always get A's and B's. So Kyle check back in into more years.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   So we're doing our tight.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.000]   Quando.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.520]   Corrado wrestling wrestling, but she does a jiu-jitsu MMA.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.160]   So,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.360]   Red Russell wrestling.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.000]   That's right.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.640]   Yeah. I didn't know they let girls do wrestling.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.600]   So now it's a sanctioned thing to have a, it's across the board, across the states.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.400]   And they have more girls sign up every day. She was the first girl in our area to do it.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.200]   She got a friend to do it. And now there's like 12 girls on the team.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:41.280]   Now there's four girls on the high school team. So she is a pioneer in a trend center in my area.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.840]   Very nice.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.520]   And a ninja.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   And a ninja.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.120]   And a ninja.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.040]   I was just looking. There's no ninja lessons on masterclass.com or sponsor today,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.640]   but you can learn chess from world chess champion Gary Kasparov.

[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.400]   Film and TV. Imagine learning acting from Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:42.560]   I love the Pulp Fiction workshop where he breaks down the script and pulp fiction.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.400]   You're actually in the scene. Remember the scene at the very beginning of the movie
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.840]   where they're in the diner and they hold it up. He takes acting students, takes the script,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.200]   and actually works his way through the script of the students talking about motivations,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.480]   talking about how to do it. That is a masterclass.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:08.560]   From one of the great actors of our time, Samuel L. Jackson, you can get all of these.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:16.160]   You can get cooking classes from people like Wolfgang Pock and Thomas Keller.

[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.280]   I think you might yell at me.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.080]   Actually, he has two series on there.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.960]   Massimo has a class in Italian cooking.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:33.200]   You want to learn Texas style barbecue, Aaron Franklin, James Beard Award-winning owner of the

[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.200]   You got to get there by 4 a.m. If I think if you want to get into Franklin,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   how about learning how to do it from the guy? This is amazing. This is masterclass.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.680]   The best classes. Learn the art of storytelling with Neil Gaiman.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.360]   How to make movies with Werner Herzog or Jody Foster or Spike Lee. It's an embarrassment of riches.

[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:11.680]   beautifully shot. You can watch them on your computer as I am or on your Apple TV. There's
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:18.080]   a masterclass app on the phone. So many different topics. Every time I see there's my buddy Steve
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.480]   Martin, every time I see one of these, I go, "How did they get Steph Curry?"
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.240]   I think really once I asked them when I was talking to the masterclass folks,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.080]   they said, "Well, people just love doing these. They want to pass. They want to pass along.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:39.680]   Pay it forward." Marty Scorsese teaching filmmaking. Each class is broken down into individual

[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:58.640]   the classes, 60 classes, 200 hours of lessons. It's just fun to watch, but I think of the things
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:05.840]   you'll learn here. They shoot them so beautifully, so intelligently. I just am a big fan.

[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.280]   That sounds real. It does sound ridiculous when you're flipping through it. I don't know.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.080]   Wow. I stopped saying "wout" to myself like five days ago. I know. These people don't need to do
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.840]   this. Obviously, they're not doing it for the money. I asked a couple of people, they said,
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.560]   "You know what? We want to pass along our art, and we want to do it in a way that represents it well.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   They're not going to come on twit and do it. They want to do it in a beautiful setting
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:28.240]   with high quality cameras. Judd Apatow teaching comedy." As an example, this is one of the classes
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.200]   I'm taking. It starts with adapting real life into a story. That's 45 minutes. Working with actors,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.800]   that's 20 minutes, half an hour making it in the business. Then there's a total of 32 videos.

[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.840]   Shonda Rhimes from Scandal, Grey's Anatomy. Aaron Sorkin on screenwriting. This is where you go,
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:10.800]   no. That can't be the Aaron Sorkin yet. Yes it is. The Aaron Sorkin. He doesn't need to do this,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.560]   but I honestly think it comes from this kind of desire to pass it along.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:24.960]   "You want answers? I think I'm entitled to the one answers. I want the truth. You can't handle
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.160]   that." By the way, Aaron Sorkin should not take credit for because I'm told Jack Nicholson had
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.480]   lived that one. Maybe that's a great. Yeah. Greatest lines in cinema history.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.880]   Great answer. Can I ask you a question for you to get started, Uncle Leo?
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.480]   If you can handle the truth, yes. Are you good at chess? Very good at chess.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.440]   I'm going to give everyone a quick masterclass, and I'm not going to play you.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.880]   So I have a friend who works for Lockheed and Martin. He is a certified genius,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.760]   and I play chess with him all the time, and he has never beaten me in the last 12 years of
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.360]   us playing together. And here on this broadcast, I'm going to tell people my secret. While we play
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:11.440]   on Yahoo or whatever we play on a computer, I also play on my phone, and I play against
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.320]   as the computer. So every move he makes, I make on the phone, and then the computer gives me the
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.680]   right move back. That's terrible. You're evil. The last 12 years. That's it, by the way.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:29.280]   A big problem in chess. Oh, yes. He's the cheating. But he's a horribly snobbish person,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.440]   and it's the only thing I could do to dig at his ego and his brain. So I keep doing it to him,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.280]   and I hope that he never listens to this episode because then he'll know more of a problem.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.920]   Do you ever play words with friends? It's more of a problem on words with friends. Yes.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.000]   Lisa plays, but she does not cheat. But there are cheat apps that will tell you all the possible
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.200]   right answers in the highest scoring answer, like in seconds. And you always know if you're
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.400]   playing words with friends with somebody who's cheating, because they're coming up with words
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.280]   like global group. And it's like, that's not a word. It's a word. I've called people cheating with
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.320]   that before. That's funny. You can't know. He's the only person I cheat against in chess,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:12.640]   but he deserves it. So there's that. Lisa and I did that against you for new years.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.920]   Oh, that was really me. We played the Magnus Carlson app.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   So we had a chess simultaneous. Remember we used to do those 24 hours of new years,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.080]   where we'd do a marathon, raise money. We raised, I think, $85,000 for UNICEF the last time we did it.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.280]   We would stay up all night. It was new years. We did it new years in every time zone across the
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.920]   globe. So it was actually, I think it was a little more than 24 hours. I don't know how that works out,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.640]   but that's apparently the case. So they had a chess simul because it's became known that I
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.360]   liked to play chess in my youth. And they had, I think, six boards or something. And I'm playing
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.600]   and I'm beating people. And all of a sudden I'm playing. Was it it was Lisa was my wife.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.320]   And she's like playing these great. I've never seen her play so well in my life.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.080]   She starts beating me. I'm getting pissed. And then I noticed she's got an earpiece.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.960]   So Carson was sitting in the other room. I was in the back room feeding her doing
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.480]   what you do Magnus Carlson's app. Pretty soon you figure that out when somebody's playing a
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:21.920]   little bit better than they ought to play. Hey, Lisa. We're going to get my Amazon Echo set up
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.640]   here because speaking of Samuel L. Jackson, you can now have his celebrity voice on your Amazon Echo.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:38.240]   And they have a profane version and a edited version. All you have to do is say,
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:46.720]   Echo introduced me to Samuel L. Jackson. It's 99 cents for all of your echoes. Now he doesn't say
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.520]   everything. But for instance, you can say, where's my package and he'll swear at you.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.600]   Something about snakes on a plane. And then the female voice will come back.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.680]   He says a lot of things though because they use text to speak. Oh, yeah. When I asked him what
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   the weather is, he says the weather in Petaluma and he'll actually in all in his voice. So it's
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:14.800]   pretty cool. If you want to get Samuel L. Jackson, do you know that he is the highest grossing actor
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:22.400]   of all time? He's been in 342 movies. He's probably in this episode of Twit. He is now.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.320]   He is the highest because he was in all those Star Wars movies. That's why.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:38.720]   He's been in a bunch of big grossing epics. Is he in the new Star Wars movie? No, I doubt it.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:48.960]   He has made 77 movies, Pulp Fiction of course, but also he's the only actor on Earth who can
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:56.640]   claim gross receipts of more than $5 billion, $5.15 billion Jurassic Park, two Star Wars films,
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.800]   Iron Man, Thor, Captain America. I bet he gets Disney Plus for free.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.000]   I've got about all the Marvel stuff. Yeah, all the Avengers stuff. I bet he gets that for free.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.200]   Samuel L. Jackson will appear on the podcast as soon as we plug in my Amazon Echo.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.720]   I would have paid $10.99 for this. The fact that this is our first one and it got it for
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.160]   $0.99, it was so free. I felt guilty about it. I love Samuel L. Jackson so much. And this is the
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.240]   greatest thing that happened in 2019. It is pretty awesome. It's awesome.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:35.120]   My favorite dumb Amazon Alexa thing is if you tell it, I recently got a cat and I was just
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.200]   messing around the other day and all family said, "Oh, Alexa, make cat sounds." And she does.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.240]   You can just keep saying me out and she'll make more and more cat sounds. And my cat freaks out
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.920]   every single time you do it. It's very realistic. You can pay $0.99 to get the expanded cat sound
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.440]   package, but I've not yet gone for that. Expanded cat sounds. Going solos.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:11.760]   What was the... I feel like Echo, what was the big technology gadget of 2019? Was it
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:20.160]   was it Echo? Was it the iPhone? What was the big time magazine? Did the hundred best gadgets of
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:26.400]   the decade? I know what the best collective was. It was Amazon. Amazon had me throw my Google
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.640]   stuff out the window. At first I was like, "Okay, whatever." Then they came out with the sub, the
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:38.240]   speaker, the clock, the watch, the toilet paper. I'm like, "Man, they got Alexa." Everything.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:45.120]   At some point, what do you need solos for where you could literally have your whole system set up?
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.880]   And I mean, if somebody's listening, they just put it everywhere. And it's really amazing.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.160]   The stuff with the lamp, putting the speaker in the lamp. That's a few interesting.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.680]   You have your solos hooked up to what? Alexa.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.160]   Oh.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.880]   So I mean, I have a solos play that's plugged into my echo dot and I have the solos one that
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:10.160]   I use Alexa with and that's perfect. Albeit, I feel increasingly bad about it, especially
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:17.600]   after reading that great Bloomberg feature about, I don't know, the thousands of contractors that
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.560]   are forced to review all of our reporting.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   All right. So I set it up by saying echo introduced me to Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:35.440]   I think he's on here right now. Let's see if I can ask him for some stuff, let's say.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.320]   Computer asks Sam what the weather is going to be.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:50.960]   Hold on second. Let me poke my head outside currently in Petaluma. It's 57 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:58.000]   with partly sunny skies. You can expect more of the same today with the high of 60 degrees
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   and a low of 34 degrees.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   I think you can also say computer asks Sam to sing jingle bells.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.040]   Oh, jingle bells.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.560]   Oh, computers stop. Okay. Apparently you can't get Sam to do that.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.200]   Computer asks Sam to tell a joke.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:26.400]   What do Jedi's wear on the golf course? I don't know. They're plus force.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:33.600]   Oh, that's awful. It's jokes are so bad. They're funny. It really gets me because I'm like,
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.480]   I don't want to laugh at them. So angry about it. It makes us we all laughed and was like,
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:43.680]   I guess the good joke. I think now this one I think works sometimes if you get the syntax,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.480]   right? Computer asks Sam what it was like to be in Star Wars.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:48:00.880]   We'll never know. We'll never know. That's wild. It's just nothing's happening.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.520]   Look what's on the screen though. It's a microphone and a spotlight like he's about to speak,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.360]   but nothing. I was waiting for a cusset. I wanted to say something.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.720]   He did. I had I turned on explicit. Echo.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:22.800]   Computer asks Samuel L Jackson what it was like being in Star Wars.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:32.000]   Man, being in Star Wars. Now, I actually did not know what character I was playing in Star Wars
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.360]   until I got to London. I got a call one day and said, George,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.200]   by the way, you in London. And then I was like, this is like, I get to London.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.520]   Sam is here. I had no idea what I was going to do. I thought I was going to be like,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:50.880]   to tell you a very long story. He kind of goes on. And then I go in this room and then
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.480]   get out of the old and he boots and stuff. And then I'm like, okay, we're going to try this
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.200]   costume. So it's really like Samuel Jackson lives next door and pops in from time to time.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.240]   And then this person comes in. I kind of wish he didn't have to say ask Sam every time that.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.480]   Yeah. So unlike so.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:15.840]   Sorry. Excuse me. Computer tell Sam shut up. So now that I would never do in person. So
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.480]   there is there are two celebrity voices. And he's got this big briefcase and he opens it up
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.640]   and it's got like eight lights they were handled in it. And he says, okay, pick one.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.240]   Computer tell him. And about pain.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:35.600]   Okay. Thank you. You worked. You did it. See, she is the automation queen. All right.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:41.200]   What was about to say? Oh, you can get ister rays on Google. You can get ister ray or
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:48.160]   John legend. And they do they become your voice. So they're doing some sort of prosody
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.440]   thing so that they record enough samples. They can get the synthesis to do everything. But that
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.200]   not on not on the echo. I'm guessing they didn't have it. Samuel Jackson money.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   You know, yeah, it's a ray and John legend. I don't know. It's an odd choice.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.720]   Do you think it's significant? I'll ask Owen this that all three of these first celebrity
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.880]   voices are African Americans. Well, when you're listening to a bionic English
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:22.480]   version of people most of the time, you want some flavor. So you might as well start off with a
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.400]   little bit of people with tan. I assume that that's what it is. A little bit more sass in their voice.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.720]   It sounds a little bit more fun. Like personally, like another voice by Samuel Jackson. Like if you
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:36.560]   had Mr. T. Who wants another weather? Yeah, don't pack it in the front door. Suckle.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:42.960]   Like that certain voices are just iconic and you know, I mean, it's great. I would like
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.920]   Oh, doctor on my Amazon. I would ran at you every five seconds. What you do or Apple stuff? Oh, Leo.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.040]   Stop it. Big tech story. And I don't think it deserved to be a big tech story, but everybody's
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:06.560]   reporting the story about the ring cameras being hacked. And in particular, the story of a young
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:16.880]   eight year old named Alyssa, her mom is a nurse. It works the night shift. And she decided to get
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:25.040]   one of these ring cameras in her daughter's room. I'll show you the video from CNN. I guess this is.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   I did a lot of research on these. So the first thing that happens is all of a sudden
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.960]   tiptoe through the tulips is playing in her daughter's room through the ring camera. Now these ring
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.760]   cameras, like a lot of them have speakers and microphones for our God. You know, like I really
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:47.360]   felt like it was safe. The camera was supposed to be an added level of protection away for Ashley
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.080]   LaMae to keep an eye on her three daughters. So I won't show the whole news thing. But eventually
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   the hacker tells the eight year old I'm Santa Claus. And why don't don't you want to be my best friend
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:13.760]   and then says, destroy your room. And then yeah, yeah. So she disconnected the camera.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:23.120]   And that's all you see in the story from CNN, many other local radio TV shows. What they neglected
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:30.480]   the mention. And I think Ring, which is an Amazon company was quick to point out is that, and
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.880]   there by the way, there was a podcast where they were in real time hacking ring cameras.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.800]   That was last week as well. But what's happening is a lot of people are buying these and they're
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:47.440]   either not changing the default password or more likely they're using a password that's been exposed
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:54.080]   in a breach from other sites. So this is a very common and terrible habit. We all have of reusing
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.280]   passwords. But if you use the same, let's say you use this password to log on to your Marriott,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.320]   your bondvoy account. Remember, Marriott was hacked. Half a billion records were exfiltrated,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.840]   including email addresses and passwords. That hacker now says, well, let's search around. We'll
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.960]   try to find the camera. You can use showdown or something like that to search for these cameras.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:21.040]   And then, well, I've got some login credentials. Let's log in and bingo. He's in because you reuse
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.680]   the password. So the advice that is never it doesn't seem like is as ever given on these stories. And
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.560]   I think I just pass this along. Anybody watching knows this, but if because you're a geek, but if
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:37.280]   you would tell your friends and family, the key, these are safe to use. You don't reuse your
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.680]   passwords anywhere. This is a side effect and put and turn on two factor authentication.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.360]   And then this is not going to happen to you.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:54.000]   I mean, I think it's valid for people to be communicating the dangers of having an internet
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.320]   connected webcam in your home at all times, given that the average person really doesn't have
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.520]   great password security. And no matter how many warnings we give them, the average person probably
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.040]   is going to continue to have terrible password security in some way or another. And so people
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.400]   should just be aware that if you are going to be using one of these devices, it's possible that
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.920]   you could have something like this happen. And that, I don't know, people should weigh the risks and
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.480]   benefits of that as they will. Do you have any of these devices in your house?
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:35.440]   I am personally a very anti ring person given the, I don't know, I've been really following all the
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:43.120]   reporting that Carolyn Haskins, who's now at BuzzFeed News and a lot of other people, I think it like
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:50.160]   Giz and motherboard and what not and Cnet have been reporting on ring and how their cameras have
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:57.040]   been kind of utilized by local police. And the ways that the webcam streams and video from their door
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:04.480]   bells are often able to kind of be used by police forces without so much as a warrant.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.800]   And that kind of skis me out so I don't have one.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:15.760]   Here's Cameron's story from Gizmodo, rings hidden data, let us map Amazon's sprawling home
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:25.360]   surveillance network. If you join the app, the neighbor app that ring lets you use neighbor's app,
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:34.160]   you can, Gizmodo went through the data from the app, 65,000 posts, many of which have location
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:40.400]   information in them. And they were able to, with just a little, you know, little data research,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:48.080]   they were able to pinpoint all the ring cameras. And now you, I don't think Gizmodo has access to
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.960]   the video from the cameras, but we know the police do. And so this map shows you how what a,
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:02.640]   what a very granular and complete video record police could make from these cameras. They don't
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:10.160]   have to be in every house. But yeah, and Caroline recently, motherboard just published this.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:17.280]   Three part series from Caroline that was fantastic, kind of tracking how rings association with
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.160]   police has evolved from like the days when they were on Shark Tank, between their product years
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.800]   ago, until now, which is really interesting to look at as well. But I think that it's just a
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.840]   really ethically complicated technology at the moment, which is why personally I have some
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.960]   hesitations about using it. Although I feel like as someone who has an Amazon Alexa in my house,
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:43.920]   I can't really complain at this point. Yeah, I noticed that there is that for some reason rings
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.840]   getting a lot of heat. What are you wearing your side sideways? I'm waiting to jump in on this.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.760]   I know you are. Hold on. Before we get the rant, he's getting ready for the rant.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.840]   He's signaling his willingness to go out on a limb here. He's charging up.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:05.680]   I have a little bit of a soft spot for ring because they were an early sponsor before Amazon
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:11.520]   bought them. We did a lot of ads for Ring. I used a Ring video doorbell for years. I have since replaced
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:17.680]   that with Google's Nest Hello, but not for any security reasons. I don't think Nest is any
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:24.000]   different. In fact, Nest may be worse. It does face recognition and invites you to identify the
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.520]   people who come to your door so that your Nest Home Hub Max can announce them. Oh, Lee says at the
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.560]   front door. It even plays a jolly little Christmas jingle. What could possibly be wrong with that,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.760]   except that potentially Google's collecting face recognition data for everybody who comes to my
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:50.160]   front door. Are the Ring quantifiably worse than any other camera system?
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:58.080]   How many of these camera systems come from a vendor that you don't necessarily know a lot about?
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.880]   I know people have a tendency to cheap out on stuff like that. If you buy something from some
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:10.480]   unknown brand that just ships from directly from China and you don't, it doesn't even have a specific
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.600]   app that they recommend that you could use this app or that app or whatever. You have no idea
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:21.040]   what these companies are actually doing with your data because it doesn't tally up. That's
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.520]   something I'm hoping that Apple's home kit camera integration is going to help fix
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.160]   with these things because at the very least there's some standard involved there for security.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:39.600]   I don't know how good this is, but we've had issues with home security stuff for years.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.440]   If you remember the old fashioned baby monitors, you could switch a channel in a two-way radio
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:54.960]   and talk directly to them. Those have been used to free kids out and to bully people in the past,
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:01.280]   back in the 90s. This is not necessarily a new problem. It's just a more technologically
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   advanced problem which has great implications. In which case you would want to buy from a company
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:13.760]   like Amazon or Google or Netgear, these are big well-known companies. They're not fly-by-night
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:20.800]   brands. They're doing auto-updating. Let me ask you this, Paris, is it your sense that it's the
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.080]   deals that they did with the local police that makes Ring so much worse than everybody else?
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.920]   I'm probably not the most knowledgeable in the comparison between Ring and some other
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:40.400]   all the other companies in this field, but I think that the part to me that I've found a
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.440]   little concerning is the way that it is portrayed as something that is benign and simply a measure
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.160]   of safety. You can connect with this neighbor's app. Keep your neighborhood safe. Meanwhile,
[00:59:52.160 --> 01:00:00.400]   this technology is in the background being used by local police forces and different groups that
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:08.640]   to surveil a neighborhood and can lead into situations where they hear from someone that
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:14.560]   they're looking for some 17-year-old kid wearing a sweatshirt in a neighborhood
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:21.440]   as they turn on all the Ring cameras and then they happen to get some other person just because it
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.760]   looks kind of the same on this camera and then it's my camera's fault that someone gets
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.200]   gunned down in the street. I don't want to be having any sort of part in that.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.800]   But has that happened? Not to acknowledge? I'm not sure, but I don't want to give...
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.240]   I'd rather not have a technology that I'm installing in front of my home being used by the police
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.040]   state to surveil the surrounding area and people who are not consenting to be surveilled.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.560]   This is so weird because Rosemary says, "Well, we're worried about hacking." And Paris,
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:56.960]   you say, "Well, we're worried about the police." So who are presumably trying to protect us from
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.720]   their hackers? I'm worried about everything. It's my general state of being.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.680]   It's the best solution just to not have anything on the other. I really like to be able to see
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.280]   who's at my front door. Before I answer it, it shows up on a screen in my house.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.200]   When I'm not home, I can see when a package has been left, I can check it.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.920]   I like that feature. Isn't that improving my security?
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:26.720]   And I'll tell you one... Yeah, I think it depends on where you live because in some places,
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.840]   adding something like this to your house could make you a target because you're demonstrating
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.280]   that you have the money to spend on stuff like this. And if you've got the money to spend on
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.760]   something like that, then surely you have something worth protecting.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.080]   But I'll have videos of them rubbing me blind.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.200]   Except they stole everything on the way out.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.160]   Including the cameras.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.160]   We're paying for the cloud of global service.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.280]   Well, that's why I paid for the cloud service. All right, it's time for Owen
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.600]   JJ Stone, O-Doctor to wait.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.320]   So before we started the show, we watched a glitter bomb thing. And the guy said that he had
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.920]   him on camera stealing his package. And the police did nothing with it even though he took
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.240]   the video to them. So the police seemed to pay to choose when they want to use video cameras,
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.520]   surveillance, and what is going to help people.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.040]   Well, they have limited resources and some crimes like stealing a $5 Amazon package off the stoop
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.400]   are deemed not important.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.880]   And I get that. But again, somebody's picking and choosing what seems important,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.840]   what doesn't. So I'm just going to say that from the jump.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.960]   When a girl is kidnapped in a car, she screamed for help and they get the camera and they got the
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.640]   car model. That was a great story that somebody's door cam heard that was screaming and she saved her
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.880]   life. Somebody else, the neighbor was cheating on his wife. So he went to his neighbor and said,
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.640]   hey, is there a car coming into the driveway? They checked the camera and he caught his,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.960]   caught her husband cheating. So I mean, there's all kinds of things going on with these cameras
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.320]   and what they're doing. The fact that the police could go into certain ones, do certain things.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.040]   We are surveilling ourselves. And so for security, for our security, for security,
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.200]   what so you're saying you want to see who's at your door? Yeah, you know what, as an older person,
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.840]   you know what you're doing? You get up, you look through the people. I'm not that old.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:09.360]   But I mean, I'm not home, but I can right now get the written consent of everyone who ever
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.680]   passes by your door, your neighbor. I don't have to get written because that when they come up onto
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.120]   my front porch, they're on my property. And if somebody's on my front porch, I'm going to get a
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.320]   notification. I'm at work. I can see who that is. And if it's a UPS guy, I could say, leave the
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.560]   package. And once he leaves a package, I can't keep an eye on the package. All of those things
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:37.360]   are to my benefit. I don't see a problem with that. I feel like I honestly feel like this is because
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:43.360]   Amazon and the ring, there's not doing anything worse than any other doorbell camera. And I feel
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.360]   like this is there is some subtext targeting Amazon on all this. I'll be honest with you.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:57.280]   I don't. The one that is actively like reaching out to police, like to police stations forming
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.960]   partnerships with the police. It's a neighborhood watch program. It's a surveillance program by
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:09.120]   the government. We used to hear that when you would have neighborhood watches. By the company,
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:15.040]   that supports ICE and like does surveillance on anyone crossing the border. I mean, it just
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.120]   continues to fall into a numerous ethical boundaries, especially because there are other
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.120]   police forces that Amazon has partnered with that have been like, how can we use the ring cameras
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.160]   in order to do facial recognition? Well, if you don't trust the police and you don't trust big
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.320]   companies and you don't trust hackers, it sounds like we got a problem here. Paris, I love you so
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:42.400]   much. Leo, you are this is just flying right over your head. Okay, so it's not about the police.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.200]   It's about working but on the person to give that information to the police. If I got my house
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.360]   broken into sure, let's share that information with the police. But the police can't just come
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.120]   willy nilly wanting to go in and out and had this kind of partnership behind my back because my
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.680]   devices are connected in a system that shouldn't be allowed to happen. You have to allow this, by
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:05.440]   the way, I never allowed my ring video to be distributed to my neighbors or to the police.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:11.920]   And you do have to turn that on. Don't really need a warrant to get access to that. I think they do.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.760]   If you don't enable it, they have to come to you and say, look, I want access to it.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.920]   Are you saying Amazon just giving it to them no matter what? I don't trust Amazon. This is America.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.840]   I feel I read Carolyn's articles. I've read the other articles and I feel like there's a lot of
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:32.480]   innuendo. Like this doesn't sound right. This doesn't seem good. But what I'd like to see is an
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:40.320]   example of police turning on those cameras without the knowledge or awareness of the woman.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.680]   Your ring doorbell footage without a warrant report says this is a Ars technical article.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:54.880]   Yeah, how do they get it last week that rings tapping directly into real time 9-1 dispatch data,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.760]   which it then uses to curate crime news for its app. Well, of course, they're tapping in the 9-1
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:08.160]   data. That's their data. It has access to the sort of data and then it uses an API call to pull the
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:18.720]   address of or GPS coordinates at the call. Where is this? Where is the part that says the warrant?
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.000]   So what I'm reading in the Gizmodar article is it says that the police can request data and it
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.600]   sends a notification to people using the neighbor app. So that's a separate app, not just sent to
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:40.000]   opt-in to. And then people can choose to decline. Now personally, I would very much like to see that
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.960]   flipped. It should be a I have to manually go in and say yes, share this data with the police.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.600]   Thank you. Instead of a no, I don't want to share my data with the police. That feels like the
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.520]   the wrong way around assuming guilt, relevant innocence. But it also doesn't tell the police
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.480]   who refused. Amazon has said that it's not refusing to cooperate. That's just not volunteering
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:07.360]   information. Amazon says and it continues to say that ring users must volunteer to share their
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:13.520]   footage in response to a police request. That police can go to ring and request footage.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   Customers can choose to opt out or decline any request and law enforcement agencies have no
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.120]   visibility into which customers have received a request in which have opted out or declined.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:32.240]   The big concern that I see is that once they get the video, there's no restrictions on what
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.280]   they can do with it. There's no deletion time frame and so forth. But it's not like they're
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.520]   just saying, "Well, let's turn on Leo's camera and see what's on his front porch. That's not happening."
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:48.480]   Just a side note before I finish up with this story anyway, that got attempted to that little
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.640]   girl's room and played Tip-Tone through the tool list. If anybody's watched a movie at Sidious
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:58.160]   with the little kids and they play that song with the little demon kid running through the house,
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.920]   if that would have been my child, we'd have jumped out of the window out of burnt house down.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:08.720]   That song scared the light grew up watching Tiny Tim on Johnny Carson singing that song
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.080]   marrying Miss Vicki. It was beautiful. It was harmless. It was sweet.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.920]   - In the movie, you have used to see it in Sidious. - I never saw it in Sidious. I'm not going to
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:22.560]   see that stuff. It's in the first 20 minutes, just watch Uncle Leo. The little kid
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.320]   is running and he's jumping in a closet in that music plant and he keeps putting it on the record.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.240]   The mom comes and turns the record off and then Tip-Tone comes back, "What man is it? Scary. I heard
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.720]   that music. I'm like, that person is the devil and he is trying to get us out of heart attack. He gave
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.240]   me a heart attack. - So let me watch it through the screen. It was evil. - I want to take a break
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.520]   and then I'm going to bring up a privacy breach that I think is much more significant.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.640]   I feel like there is a concerted effort to put Amazon out of the doorbell business for some reason.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.120]   And I'm not convinced that the reasons are good or that the Ring Doorbell is somehow worse than
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   Google's doorbell or there are a half dozen doorbell cameras out there. - They should force people to
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.200]   update their password every six months or something because you're right. Most people don't do it at
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.360]   all and that's the biggest problem. - I think the better. - You try to explain that to regular people
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.840]   and they don't care. - I think the better solution is if somebody tries to set a password that's
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.160]   you know in "Have I Been Pawned?" they have an API for this where you can submit it using
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.440]   a password and it will go "Yeah, no." - Chrome now does that. - This is a name-vallic combination.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.920]   By the way, change everywhere else you're using this password. Take a bit of responsibility on as
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.360]   a company as well to educate your users that are your selling and technology to you. - That was just
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.520]   added the latest version of Chrome. It says that password you're using is bad. That's why we really
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:49.040]   encourage a password manager and generate a new password every single time. Let's take a break.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.720]   But I do want to talk about the worst thing and I think far worse than anything Amazon's done
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.600]   with the ring cameras. That's coming up in just a second. But first, let's talk about how to use a
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.360]   better browser. Yes, Chrome is fine. In fact, a lot of us have used Chrome for years because that's
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.040]   the standard on the web. Wouldn't it be nice if I could get all the benefits of Chrome, all the
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:16.720]   features of the Chrome browser without the Google privacy, you know, invasions? Well, you can.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:23.600]   And it's called Brave. Brave is a better browser, a next generation browser. It's based on the
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.640]   Chromium code base. So every time Google pushes an update to Chrome, you'll get an update to Brave.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:35.840]   You'll get all the latest stuff, but they've taken out the bad stuff. It's created by a team,
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.640]   the Brave team focused on privacy. And by the way, when you take out ads, you take out extra
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.400]   JavaScript, you get a faster browser up to six times faster than the competitors. You get a safer
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:52.800]   browser. You use less data. It blocks trackers. In fact, all you have to do is go in the Brave
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:11:00.320]   browser, go to the settings. It's a fabulous browse through all of the amazing things you can do.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:07.120]   All the trackers you can block. You can cross site, upgrade all your connections to HTTPS.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.920]   You can still use all your Chrome plugins, but there's so many I no longer use. I don't need
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.520]   you block origin. I don't need HTTPS everywhere. I don't need no script. I can turn off scripts.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:24.320]   I can block all device recognition. I can block cookies, cross site cookies, all cookies. I can,
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.480]   oh, this one, I didn't turn it off yet, but I'm going to turn off Facebook logins and embedded posts.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.000]   Oh, I took these are off by default. Allow Twitter embedded tweets. These are all surveillance
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.680]   techniques. Allow LinkedIn embedded posts. Those are turned off on mine. I use start page instead
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:50.960]   of Google as my search. I just think brave is fantastic and it is so good for people who care
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.880]   about privacy, but don't want to give up compatibility. It's easy to set up. You just one click,
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.240]   you can switch browsers efficiently, copy all your bookmarks over. Brave sync means all of your
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.440]   bookmarks will automatically get copied over. You're going to save battery life reduced data costs
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:14.800]   on mobile. Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, wherever you are, there is a brave browser.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.360]   I make it my default everywhere. I'm using it right now. The one thing I always feel guilty about
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.160]   because we're an ad supported network, when I go to a site like imore.com or verge or whatever,
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.280]   I'm blocking ads. So I'm taking money out of their mouth and I want to keep using those sites.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.480]   Braves kind of come up with a great solution for this. They call them bat tokens, basic attention
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:40.080]   tokens. It's a way you can still give publishers back their fair share of web revenue without
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:47.280]   seeing intrusive security risking ads. You can buy bat tokens with cash or, and I like this idea,
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.320]   and you don't have to do any of this, but you can opt into Braves privacy respecting ads.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.240]   These are ads that don't show up on the browser page, but show up as notifications.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.200]   You can click them or not, but as you see these ads, you'll earn bat tokens, and then you can
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.560]   give them to the sites that you visit as a way of paying them without having to see their ads.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:13.280]   Yesterday was about Big Tech. Today is about us. Brave. That's the best browser, faster, more secure,
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.480]   and they are really doing a great job at Brave. Brave.com/tread. I know you probably just want
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.440]   to Google Brave and download it. Do me a favor, go to Brave.com/tread. That way you're going to
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:30.880]   let them know you saw it here. 1.0 just came out there, big out of beta release, and it's just
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.640]   fantastic. Brave.com/tread. Just downloaded it, and I'm zooming on.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.320]   Oh, you'll like it? Yeah, you'll like it. It's fast. I just want to like two pages.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.880]   I know. I really still load, and it was really nice.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:52.800]   This one, to me, was more of a shock than the Ring doorbell thing. Although, and I will point
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.920]   out, I don't use the Ring doorbell anymore. I use the Nest Home doorbell, but as I also pointed
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.880]   out, that could even be worse, just because they don't have the neighbor's app.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:09.200]   And part of the problem is that when law enforcement comes to a company like Google or Amazon
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.760]   and says, "When hopes with a warrant, we want this information," they have no way to say no, right?
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:24.000]   So this is one I think I wish Google had fought. There was a fire bug in Milwaukee,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.440]   Wisconsin, set a number of fires through 2018 and 2019, $50,000 in property damage,
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:38.480]   killed a couple of dogs. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms went to Google and said,
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:50.320]   "We want every user device within 29,000 square meters of those fires."
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.280]   This has location history turned off. Yeah. Well, during a total of nine hours,
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:01.360]   so they collected, if you've got location history turned on, which is on by default,
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.720]   if you're using Google Maps, if you're using many Google services it's on,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.520]   they collected 1,500 names of people who were around when these fires were set.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:21.280]   The ultimate phishing expedition. And then apparently, so Google looks through its sensor vault database,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.120]   if provides that information, the police then look through the list,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.920]   decide which devices are of interest and ask for subscriber information,
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.320]   name, email address, when they sign up to Google services, which services they used,
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.800]   a lot of information. So initially, the police get anonymized data, and then the police apparently
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:50.640]   have the opportunity to ask for unanonymized data. In fact, in this case, according to Forbes,
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:58.800]   investigators asked for information on six users and Google provided it. So a very nice handy tool
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:06.480]   makes police job easier. It also makes every innocent person within, what was it, 30,000 square
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:16.000]   meters, a suspect. What do you think? It feels like they're building a haystack to find a needle
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.800]   in many ways. Because they started with 1,500 people and they then got further details on six.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:33.120]   That said, I don't know how rural this area of Milwaukee is in Wisconsin. I'm guessing fairly,
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.320]   so it might have been a lot of legwork to do this by hand. And I don't know whether or not they
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.720]   would have managed it if they've been doing everything on foot. But at the same time,
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.920]   so many people don't know that this feature is enabled on their phone, Android or iPhone.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.760]   And they think maybe they're safe because they've got passwords and stuff. And then it turns out
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.040]   that no, some company can just hand their data over to the police without them saying yes or no,
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:05.040]   because they agreed to 340 pages of terms and conditions that they just swipe, swipe, swipe, tap
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:12.400]   done. In general, you think of the world of criminals and they always say criminals are stupid.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:17.040]   What about the criminals are just turning off their phone or don't take their devices with them?
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.520]   And now you're looking for that needle in a haystack and I don't know, they're going to do it
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.320]   and if they go about it the right way, they get a warrant and they go through procedures.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.960]   I guess there's not much you can say about it. But it's just interesting that they think that,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.440]   oh, we're just going to track all these phones. I guess every criminal is out here taking selfies
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.240]   while they're setting buildings on fire or shooting people and that they need their phone to go get
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.920]   the information from them. And mind you, there are criminals or kids that are posted stuff on
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.840]   Instagram, smoke weed, playing with guns. I get that. But I mean, in general, just to be,
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.280]   oh, we're just going to search all the devices. It's, I don't know. I don't like it. I don't like it
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:01.920]   one bit. The Jerome Greco is a public defender in the digital forensics unit of the Legal Aid Society
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:07.920]   was quoted in the Forbes story saying, "Geofence warrants are overly broad and
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.800]   in danger user privacy. The number of phones identified in that area shows two key points.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.840]   One, it demonstrates a sample of how many people's minute by minute movements Google is precisely
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.840]   tracking." I think anybody listening to our shows knows that. "Two, it shows the unconstitutional
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.840]   nature of reverse location search warrants because they inherently invade the privacy of
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:35.440]   numerous people who everyone agrees are unconnected to the crime being investigated for the mere
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:42.160]   possibility it may help identify a suspect. The police liken it to a camera recording in a bank
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.600]   robbery. It records everybody in the bank, most of whom are victims innocent victims,
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.040]   but it helps the police figure out who the robbers are."
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:59.920]   How many of these people were residents of the area? Well, we don't know because there have been
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:06.560]   no arrests. And that's the other thing. The person got away with it for so long and they've got to
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:13.040]   avoid the desk cams, the ring cams, the person seeing them down the street walking their dog
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:19.280]   being nosy. So again, this criminal obviously is rather bright and avoiding police detection.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.120]   And so much so that even doing this has still not caught that person by violating other people's
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.720]   rights to do so. I got to say that. I don't want to be the one to go against crime and try to find
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.960]   somebody who's on her killing dogs. But at the same time, you got to do better police work.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.520]   Like there's got to be other things you can do. Yeah, Google can't be doing all the work for you.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.960]   ATF.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.040]   Who broke into my house? Let me Google it. The ATF of course had no comment, but two suspects
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:52.800]   were named in warrants. None of them have been charged at the time of this Forbes article.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:20:00.560]   Google says we fight these. And we only give this information when when we absolutely legally
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:07.680]   have to. And I'm sure that that's the case. I don't think Google Apple anybody wants to,
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.000]   maybe Amazon does. I don't know. Maybe that's the difference.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.440]   Yeah, I guess the message here is that Google, if you're using Google Maps or whatever,
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:24.960]   it's probably tracking this information. You should go in, turn off location services on that,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:30.880]   or at least the live location data. In addition to this, I feel like this data,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.880]   I've seen it's often kind of the center of a lot of controversy. There was God. I feel like a Reddit
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.360]   posts on our relationships, my favorite drama-filled subreddit that was something to the effect of
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:50.080]   Google Maps data is ruining my trust and my marriage was the headline. And it was a woman who,
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.520]   her husband, she'd always thought he'd been faithful, goes on a lot of work trips. He
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.880]   lost his phone, so she was trying to look at his Google location data to see where it went,
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.040]   and saw that every time he went on a trip out of state for work, he was actually at an apartment
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:17.520]   across the city. Oh, crap. Yeah, busted. But I mean, yeah, it gets all of us if you don't turn it off.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.200]   It tracks down to the block of where you are, down to the apartment.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.400]   I'm not speaking from experience here, but it is a lot harder to cheat now.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:32.640]   This is not personal experience. But just as the police can use these devices, so can spouses.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:38.320]   And you really are carrying a surveillance device in your pocket with a microphone, a camera,
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.880]   GPS, a log of everywhere you've done, everything you've done.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.400]   And even if you control those elements, like I do when I wear my full hat and I go out and
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.200]   commit atrocious crimes, I go out in my silver suit. You still got to worry about other people's
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:57.760]   phones and devices and surveillance cameras and such a good weather. Are you really looking
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.880]   at that? You're looking at that, aren't you? I knew it. I knew you were. Everybody's got a
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.960]   cell phone out there. So even if you thought, oh, I'm gonna leave my phone at home while I cheat
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.240]   to my wife, and you go out to a restaurant, somebody else is gonna be snapping a picture real quick.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:15.680]   I mean, again, it's not the cheating is the biggest thing in a row, but it's just weird
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.880]   that everyone is watching everything. I posted a video the other day of a woman going to a gas station
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.560]   and filling up a shopping bag full of gasoline. What? She tied it on. Put it on the ground.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:34.080]   No, went to her trunk. She went to her trunk, got another shopping. No, double bagged it,
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.000]   tied it off and put it in her trunk. And the video ends. And all I wanted was this person to
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.600]   follow this woman home. I needed to know what happened. She had a body to burn and she had limited
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:49.200]   time. Like that was not an approved plastic container for her to put in the trunk of her SUV.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.760]   My mind is breaking and I just need to know the rest of that story. She light up a cigarette as
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.920]   she got in the car because that would have been a interesting ending. It's the most
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.240]   weirdest thing I've ever seen. I mean, the bag was literally seeping gasoline out of it.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.120]   And she thought, Oh, I'll just double bag it and then puts it in the trunk of her car. I'm like,
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.040]   whoever's filling it, follower, please just follower. Crazy.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.320]   For the interest of public safety, I think you kind of have to there.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.280]   Yeah. Yeah. I need to know the rest of that story.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   Apparently, this video has made it worldwide. I don't.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.560]   There you go. That's you. That's her. This is not me. I didn't film it. I just, I just
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.080]   shared it because it was so amazing.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:30.240]   Okay.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   She'll just be out of fire. I need to know what's going on. I'd ask her if I can help.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.240]   Like you need me to help you.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.760]   Just get in the truck. What do we do?
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.640]   Pro-gour fuel points. So it really is true. Jesus is such a bad idea.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.920]   So what a thing. Oh my God.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:52.560]   It is. Well, maybe she just didn't have a gas can and she needed to.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.200]   Don't they sell gas cans at gas stations in the US?
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:55.680]   Yes.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.600]   Like they do everywhere else I'd be.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.800]   But look, watch. See, she goes to double bag it.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.400]   Well, that's safe.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.360]   Let me double bag it.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.080]   That's a good idea.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.240]   Oh, I can't.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.960]   Oh, she has no idea what she's playing with here.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.000]   I need to know that she lived to somebody burned.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.680]   Did she just need to feel like it's always,
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.160]   looks like it was splashing gas out of it.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.960]   Yes. It's leaking. That's what I said. It's crazy.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.160]   Where's the camera?
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.120]   Oh my God.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.640]   Oh my God.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.000]   Everybody's got a camera.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.760]   Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.800]   She's putting it in the trunk.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.320]   Why?
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.480]   Why?
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:30.960]   Oh.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.800]   It's so crazy.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.600]   I need to know.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.680]   Does this story say what happened?
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.560]   Does anybody know?
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.760]   I didn't realize.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.200]   I just did a video.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.240]   Look at that.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.280]   It's amazing.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.400]   If you're on audio right now,
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.640]   you've got to come to the show and watch this video.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.120]   Wow.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:45.600]   Wow.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.000]   Okay.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.840]   Well, then you could pretty much imagine it, I think.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.480]   All right.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.120]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.800]   I feel bad for kids these days because they can't do anything.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.280]   It was it's not not.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.120]   My kids needed living in a small town
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.240]   because the chances of them running in this a neighbor
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.480]   when they were drinking the 50 cent vodka was high.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:12.880]   But with video cameras, you can't get away with anything anywhere anymore.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.400]   Especially because nowadays,
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.720]   kids, parents are installing those surveillance apps and all their kids' phones,
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.880]   like life 360 and whatnot.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.840]   That, I don't know, if you're speeding in a car,
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.920]   it will send an alert to your parents.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.400]   It shows your live location at all times.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.440]   And if you turn off your phone or disconnect from it,
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.480]   it'll send an alert and the kid will be grounded,
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.760]   which is insane to me.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.720]   I mean, it just seems beyond belief that kids these days and,
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.440]   yeah, for I guess the last decade or so,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.640]   now have to live in a world where you're constantly being surveilled at all times.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.720]   The real problem with doing that is you're just getting the kids used to the idea.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.920]   So they now grow up as citizens.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.440]   They go, well, what's the big idea?
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.360]   I've always been spying on my own life.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:05.520]   I mean, how I even found out about life 360 is through TikTok videos where
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.440]   the life 360 was a trending hashtag for a while.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.240]   And it was TikTok videos of kids instructing other kids on how to
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:23.120]   fix your device in a certain way that it shows life 360 that you're still online in
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.840]   the approved area, but really you can be somewhere else.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.320]   So I mean...
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.480]   I wanted to...
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.200]   This is going to be an okay boomer moment.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.840]   What's the deal with TikTok?
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.480]   It's great.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.200]   It's awful.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:37.920]   I'm down.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.560]   Yes.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.640]   I keep trying to watch it.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.800]   Everything on the internet is awful.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.680]   It's awful.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.560]   It's just clip after clip of awfulness.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.600]   One after the other.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:47.920]   Okay.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.400]   Okay.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.200]   So I'm just thinking of going through the...
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   You have to go through the 4U page until you find something you kind of like,
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.400]   and then you have to like...
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.280]   You have to like it or...
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.880]   I'm not curating this crap.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.200]   Then curated crap is still crap.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:01.680]   We have also...
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.240]   will quickly send you to a place that you enjoy.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.200]   Have you seen the Washington Post's TikTok account?
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:07.600]   No, I haven't...
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.480]   Or TikTok account?
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:08.960]   No.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.760]   It is quite good.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.360]   It's a lot of good news.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.560]   So there's also Instagram feeds of curated TikTok videos,
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.840]   which I've been involved with quite good.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.440]   And I like the idea of somebody else doing the curation for me,
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.720]   because I'm very lazy.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.920]   That said, I've still not really tried TikTok.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.320]   You said...
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.960]   Okay.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:27.920]   You said the important thinkers,
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.600]   which is the internet is full of crap.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.960]   Go ahead.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.160]   Oh yeah, everything is bad.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:32.640]   This is...
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.440]   Have you seen the kombucha TikTok video?
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.760]   Woman trying kombucha for the first time.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.080]   I don't...
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.600]   So...
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.080]   It could be...
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:40.560]   Let me just...
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.320]   Let me just fix you right now, Gileo.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.040]   Let me just fix it.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.560]   Here's the lady.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.840]   This is her first time...
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.120]   Watching.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:47.680]   You're gonna love it?
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.000]   And it really smells like a public restaurant.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.560]   You tell...
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.520]   Now you folks at home, you tell me if I'm missing anything by not...
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.720]   It smells like a public restaurant.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.920]   Is this the one you're talking about?
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.120]   You know what?
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:27:59.840]   Yes.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.080]   Wait.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.960]   No.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.640]   Well...
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.120]   That's it!
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.360]   That's something I had to see.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.480]   That's the content.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.200]   So let me...
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.600]   Just let me fix it for you, Gileo.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.760]   First of all, do you like music, Gileo?
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.560]   Yes or no question.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.600]   You're talking about musically.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.200]   Yes, I like music.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.440]   Yes.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.320]   So you like music.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.520]   That's for us to form us.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.880]   Secondly, earlier, didn't we both together say,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.560]   "You can't handle the truth?"
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.920]   Didn't you know that line, right?
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.400]   You like it?
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.200]   Okay.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:33.600]   Is that...
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.560]   TikTok the truth?
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.040]   TikTok is not the truth.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.400]   TikTok is not the truth.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.440]   TikTok is quotables and it's music.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   And that video, that chick is just a random video.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.040]   You can find anywhere on any platform.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040]   So it doesn't get relegated to just TikTok.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040]   It just happened to air on TikTok first.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.920]   But generally, if you like music and you like quoting things,
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.960]   TikTok is fine.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.800]   You're just being old and grumpy.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.400]   It's the same thing that you look at
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.200]   on everything else that you do when you quote anything
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.360]   or say anything that you've heard throughout your lifetime.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.200]   So you, sir, are already a TikTok.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.760]   You're a dinosaur TikTok, but you be TikTok every time.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.880]   You sing along through a song or you say you can't handle the truth.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.400]   You have just been TikTok.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.600]   So you like it.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.800]   Don't complain about it.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.280]   Okay, Boob.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.040]   Do you want to watch the top 10?
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.680]   The notable about TikTok is that you can...
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:21.280]   Like you create memes and respond to things via sounds.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.320]   Like, I don't know, it's safe.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.520]   Like you can't handle the truth.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.200]   Like a clip featuring that.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.560]   Yeah. People would remix.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.680]   No, I get it.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.200]   It's not that I don't understand it.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.760]   Just think it's stupid.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.480]   Here are the most...
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.240]   This is TikTok's year in review.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.600]   The most viral clips on TikTok.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.720]   We'll watch a couple of them.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.680]   Oh, bear. That's my favorite.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.640]   I let a bear.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.360]   Here's a bear.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.600]   The guy's in a bear suit at the top of the stairs.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.520]   Oh, it's not playing.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.360]   It's not playing.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:49.840]   You know, sometimes...
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.720]   You've got to get a cookie that.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.280]   Oh, I'm mad.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.480]   Let me go to the TikTok site and see if it'll play off of that.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:58.080]   Here is the top...
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.160]   Top 10...
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.720]   Full screen?
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   I think sometimes Brave blocks this.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.120]   Thank you, Brave.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.680]   Celebrities.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.440]   Here's the top 10 breakout creators.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440]   The top 10 dance trends.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.880]   Top 10 creative effects.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.320]   This is from TikTok itself.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.440]   Does it bother you its own by Tencent, a Chinese company?
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.600]   Does that bother you at all?
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.960]   You think they're...
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.120]   Oh, ring doorbell.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.160]   They're spying on you.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.360]   TikTok is nice.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.000]   It's fun.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.680]   I mean, every company is spying on us.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.760]   Every company is bad, in my opinion.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.880]   I think that a lot of the outrage and...
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.680]   They're going to pour something into this.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.120]   Hold on.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.640]   Let's see what happens.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.880]   Okay, they're pouring something.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:45.280]   It's ex...
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.240]   Oh my God!
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.400]   That's horrible.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.280]   Whatever happened.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.480]   There.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.160]   It was some sort of weird chemical.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.960]   It's elephant toothpaste.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.280]   Elephant toothpaste from me.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.160]   In a very big...
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.440]   Here's the bear suit,
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.800]   Daredevil.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:04.160]   He is wearing a bear suit at the top of the fuzzy stairs.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.160]   I bet you...
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.920]   ♪ Wonder where I've been ♪
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.760]   ♪ I said goodbye ♪
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.360]   Okay, he slid down the stairs.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.960]   Now he's going to ride a bicycle.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.600]   Oh, boom!
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.800]   That doesn't seem smart.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.480]   But that's it.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.520]   That's the whole thing.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.840]   He made viral content.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.640]   Do they have 619,000 likes?
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.680]   16 second videos?
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.840]   It is what it was.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.560]   Here's what it was.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.440]   It is what it was,
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.200]   which is not worth my time.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.400]   Here's somebody putting shaving cream in his crocs.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.720]   See?
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.680]   That's the contrary.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.280]   This is what's wrong with America right now.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.960]   It's idiocracy.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.040]   So, there's people throwing cheese on other people in their homes.
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:55.600]   It's wonderful.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.080]   To a YMCA.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.880]   I erased it from my phone because I realized
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.440]   that I was spending time watching stuff like that.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.600]   What else are you doing when you're in a bathroom or like
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.320]   taking a nap?
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.520]   ♪ Feel real ♪
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.080]   ♪ Feel real ♪
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.080]   Here he is feeding hummingbirds.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.880]   ♪ Get it, get it, go, let go ♪
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.520]   And the whole thing about the music is you use clips.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.200]   You can reuse people's clips.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.720]   I bet it's really good for the artists, right?
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.640]   Yes.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.680]   Because they get a lot of it.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.920]   It makes you feel like you get...
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.800]   Like, that's kind of where Old Town Road came from.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.440]   It's TikTok.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:31.680]   Right.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:33.920]   That's right.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.160]   That made Lil Nas X a star, right?
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:36.720]   TikTok.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.080]   Yes.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.880]   Okay.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.200]   Maybe this will make the courtettes a star.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.680]   Oh
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.280]   It's a kitty cat
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:58.560]   They're laughing in the studio. It's obviously a hit
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.240]   We'll probably get better numbers if I start playing this stuff like 20 times
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:08.120]   Yeah, and then but then what happens with tick tock is I never saw that I saw the derivative videos
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.420]   Including like Hillary Clinton or somebody doing the same thing, you know if you have a team
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:19.220]   You can they'll come to you and say well we've got you to you just have to do this and then we'll make this video
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:28.160]   Yep, that's what they do. They ruin everything marketers ruin everything. Well is it is it not the case that tick tock's getting overrun by celebrities now in brands
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.500]   It's the same as everything else
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.700]   Snapchat has brands on it Instagram has brands on it
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.380]   When you're following a core group of people you're following them and not for nothing
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:44.640]   I just check I spot my daughter's phone directly with her because we do it together
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.740]   But I just I look at all the stuff that their file and these kids are following and they're not really looking at any of these brands
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:54.180]   It's for older people like oh, I want to be friends with the rock and the kids are like, okay
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:58.700]   If he's on the main feed I'll watch it, but they're not really following to see what the rock is posting
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:04.280]   Yeah, they might look at a musical artist or you know, they're more likely to follow YouTube stars or
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:08.700]   Girl doing makeup tutorials and they are following these celebrities and brands
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:11.300]   So I mean they're on every platform it is what it is
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:16.220]   But it's very interesting if you can get your hands on a 12 to 14 year old kid
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:20.100]   Just ask them what they're looking at and you will see a whole new world of
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:25.940]   Content and information and where you need to be if you are a marker and how you could get tapped into those kids
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:33.540]   We do have our own Twit tick tock. I've just been informed. They don't have you dancing in the hallways uncle Leo apparently they do
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.860]   Lot of good tech people on tick tock the thing
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.260]   I'm trying to remember they even been account
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:41.220]   But there's one account that I spent like an hour watching
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:46.380]   It was just somebody who works at a computer repair shop and they'll do like really fascinating videos
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:50.380]   But how to have just what disgusting computer they're brought and how he fixes it or
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:57.180]   So you can so it's not a six second or a 15 seconds a longer tick tock obvious you can stitch videos together. Yes
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:59.620]   Yeah, I mean it, but it's kind of
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:06.260]   Brought like it's really really fast. There was one where he built a computer himself
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.860]   Like the most bare minimum parts and then submerged it entirely in wax from candles
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:18.340]   Slowly but surely and wanted to see how much wax he could put on it before it like stopped working
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:24.580]   And I watch from like six videos of him boring wax in this computer here is here is our Twit tick tock
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:27.220]   And I am handing out
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.540]   Apparently a handing out
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:36.020]   Holiday cards to our staff. I mean, I know I even know this existed there you go Carson. Here's your bonus
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.300]   It's a match box
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:48.260]   I had no idea they were doing this
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:54.860]   So you're so it's it's a I can't go Leo. You're going to CES in January, right? Yeah
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.060]   I'm not to fly out. You want to see it tick tock
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:02.740]   You want to see a little bit of how the studio got decorated look at this look at this
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:08.780]   This is how the studio got decorated. They brought in all the all the garbage the point setters
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:17.380]   They brought in all the garbage all the Santa barfed on the studio here we come apparently we keep all that stuff in a cabinet
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.540]   All year long recycle
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:29.220]   So these aren't real point setters. I thought they looked awfully healthy. Oh, I found it. Hold on. I'm in a message
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:34.260]   Alright, you got it. You got the ultimate tick tock. She's going to send it on to us. Here we go
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:40.140]   Find uh, oh, where did this go? This is our boomer minute. I can't see your
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:44.740]   Paris we're just just drop it in the into the dock drop it
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:48.580]   All right when we come back
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.860]   Paris's
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   Best tick tock of 2019
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:59.700]   How about that Paris Martin? Oh, how about that? Get it ready for us. Meanwhile, let me talk about our uh sponsor express
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:07.700]   VPN now it's interesting isn't it that a lot of our sponsors this week are about privacy about security
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:16.580]   A lot of our stories are about privacy and privacy invasion. I guess uh, there's something going on here express VPN is my choice for a vpn
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:22.500]   They're trustworthy. They are audited by an independent third party who verifies their privacy policy
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:26.580]   Verifies that their trusted server technology saves nothing
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:34.100]   So that you're never logged. Nobody's nobody's recording your visit or your use of express VPN. I like that
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:39.940]   Uh, I like their price. It's very affordable. I'm going to show you a way you can make it even more affordable about seven bucks a month
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:45.700]   By the way, you may say well. I can get a free vpn. No, no, no, do not get a free vpn a free vpn
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:52.500]   Everybody runs a vpn. They're our costs. They're making money somehow and if they're not charging you they're making money somehow
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.220]   They're injecting ads into your stream. They're seeing what you do. They're doing something to monetize you
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:04.340]   Express vpn. They don't do any of that. They can't they literally technically can't it also is a really great way
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:08.260]   To expand your tv horizons your movie horizons
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:14.660]   Because you can use express vpn to be in any country of the world there express vpn servers all over the world
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   So for instance, just
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:23.620]   You could binge on dr. Who or star trek by just firing up express vpn changing your location to the uk
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:27.220]   Refreshing netflix suddenly you're seeing the uk netflix
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:33.220]   Express vpn hides your ip address. Let's you control where you want sites to think you're coming from
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:38.660]   If you love anime use express vpn to access japanese netflix get all the japanese
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:47.140]   Anime tv shows it's fantastic and it's not just netflix express vpn works with any streaming service hulu bbc's iplayer youtube
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:52.020]   You name it just another great reason to use express vpn
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.100]   It's fast one of the reasons netflix says we don't want you to use a vpn
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:01.140]   They even admit this they say with only reason is because it's going to slow you down. It's not going to be a good experience
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.220]   not express vpn
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:07.700]   hd video streams in beautifully at full speed the other day
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:13.460]   I was demonstrating this on ios today and I was showing how I could watch japanese netflix on express vpn
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:21.300]   I forgot to turn it off. I downloaded the ios 13 updates. I surfed around. I didn't even I didn't even notice it's that fast
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.660]   It just it's just amazing works with all your devices
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:29.380]   Not just your phones and your computers, but your media consoles even your smart tv's
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:34.020]   So you can watch what you want on the go or on the big screen wherever you are
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:40.020]   Right now we're going to get you an extra three months of express vpn when you sign up for the year package
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:48.340]   So that's a really great deal when you go to express vpn.com/twit express vpn.com/twit
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:51.700]   It's the number one most trusted vpn. It's the one I recommend the one I use
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:57.780]   It's fast and it's really great express vpn.com/twit
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:02.980]   Do we have paris martinose tick tock of the year
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:09.060]   It's a tick tock series honestly. This is one of the last. Oh, this is the one we put in wax
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:15.540]   Yeah, so he's already put like four or five tubs of wax on this computer, but it's still working
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.900]   Oh my god. Oh that was great. That wasn't good
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.900]   Shut right off. Oh no, and it's leaking like crazy
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.900]   Oh boy. I have officially made a huge mess
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:31.460]   Way easier to clean up. So you you'll instead of watching game of thrones
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:34.500]   You'll stay at home of a long waiters night. You'll watch this
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:41.300]   Oh, yeah, I think I spent like a 30 minutes 20 evening watching all these parts great. No way
[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:47.380]   It's not over yet boot in the window. What's he trying to kill it? It will be fully in case
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:51.220]   He's trying to fully in case it's in wax
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.420]   Yeah
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.820]   He knows that's bad for the thermals
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:01.060]   Died in the middle of the second part
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.380]   Do you have a second tray of wag?
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:09.700]   Finally, let's get it poured off. I'm sorry, but that's the best angle we're gonna get
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:14.740]   This is why I despair for the future
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:22.820]   Does tick tock only support portrait videos by the way, right off. Oh, no, what do you mean? What's wrong with portrait videos rosemary orchard? Oh boy
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:28.740]   I've used to landscape. I mean, I'm sitting here and I am in a landscape frame. How do you hold your phone?
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:31.540]   Do you hold your phone sideways?
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.940]   When i'm taking video. Yes
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.300]   See you're you're a good human being you're a proper person
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:44.820]   But you live in a world that is the antithesis and the exact opposite of you because every time you see a fight video every time you see a house
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.620]   On fire the person stands there in films like this
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:53.860]   No one in their right mind ever does what you want them to do and turn the camera. No one does it they go. Oh
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.660]   Before
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:03.460]   No one ever just turns their phone all the professionals recording video and podcast turn their cameras to write up
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.660]   Everybody shoots on their phone shoots like this and it drives me crazy
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.460]   Don't bring it up again because people are stupid and no one does
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.180]   I think people are right. It should be vertical. That's the screen you're looking at the screen you're shooting with
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.820]   That's how people are watching it. Paris Martin. No
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:20.580]   You're losing someone's real estate. I'm watching it like that
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.180]   You're not losing real estate. You're getting the tall angle
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.980]   It feels all tall but also
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.220]   Yeah, it feels a screen you you were lucky. I don't have gaffers tape right now
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.700]   I'm about to put it over my
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:40.020]   50 millimeter camera. Where's my gaffers tape that i'm gonna make you watch me the rest of this episode and portrait move
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.300]   Actually john backed me up when we first set up our avatar set up
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:50.420]   We wanted to do it in portrait mode because that would be the natural way for people to be sidded
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.340]   Seated and it was too
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.100]   We had to get special devices to do that unfortunately so
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.940]   Special device well
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.940]   Yeah, because you can't you can't just rotate
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:06.500]   The screen and everything will arrange itself. You have to get a device that feeds the screen portrait video
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.900]   And actually might maybe today you could do that because they
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:16.020]   They do on this day year that I watch where they crop them in like that because they have four people side by side
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:21.380]   And the one person speaking to the four and they do yeah of them in that vertical so john let's get let's get to work
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:27.540]   Let's do it uncle here 2020. Let's do it 2020 vertical video for all you just contradicted yourself
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:30.820]   I just want to say something. Oh, i'm angry about it. I'm not liking it at all
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.180]   And when you put me on that i'm gonna shrink my projection to make me strong
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.100]   See we're wasting all this side space on you. I want to get the vertical
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.740]   What do you want to see my
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.820]   See that I want to see more of paris
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:47.060]   I'm a little bit bigger than you lady. So i'm already ultra wide. I don't know
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:53.060]   Inside that portrait screen. I'll just say you know what i mean? I I might push the boundaries on that
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:57.380]   You know did we did we do a best-of video from the week? Do you have that?
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:04.420]   We did not we're we're too busy doing best-of videos for the entire year. I should mention that. Yeah, so
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:06.420]   The way this is gonna work
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:12.980]   Christmas in the United States. I don't know how it is in Vienna, but Christmas in the United States is on December 25th
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.580]   Which is a wednesday?
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.980]   So i'm not going to make anybody work on new years eve
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.380]   So what we're going to do is we're going to do our new years eve shows December 23rd monday
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.260]   So that's windows weekly. That's this week in google

[01:44:53.220 --> 01:45:00.500]   We did uh, some of you already know we did a special holiday twit with stacey higginbotham mary jofoli and mica sergeant
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.500]   That was a look back at the decade
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:09.620]   That that's really a fun show. Uh that will so when is that gonna air carson that'll air that'll air a week from today

[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.940]   I think you're wrong
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:22.100]   I think you're wrong. I don't have to be here next on the 22nd on the 20 second
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.820]   I can do the tech guy. How about how do the radio show but then i'll go home
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.780]   Well instead of doing twits. So next week will be our
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:34.900]   Our your decade in review the that's the 22nd and 29th will be the best of so all the week

[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:44.340]   And so that's that's that's this that's the promo
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:49.140]   Uh kind of a surprise from jack this week jack dorsey
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.900]   Uh the ceo of twitter tweeted twitter is funding
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:58.900]   A small independent team of up to five open source architects engineers and designers
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:02.900]   To develop an open and decentralized standard for social media
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.660]   The goal is for twitter to ultimately be a client of this
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.300]   standard
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:13.140]   So has he heard of activity pub?
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:19.780]   Which is already an open source and decentralized system for more mastodon, which is a
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:24.260]   Which is based on activity pub. Yeah is a version of you know that
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:30.500]   Uh, in fact, that was the first thing the the founder of mastodon said is I think we already did that
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:35.700]   Yeah, there's a couple of open standards that are already out there w3c standards
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:39.860]   There's the indy web which has a variety of systems for integrating between
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.700]   independent platforms such as web mentions where I can
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:49.780]   Reply to something somebody else is posted on my website and it sends their website a notification to say hi
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:52.420]   This is you know relevant to you and to this post
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:47:00.260]   So I'm very curious as to why he thinks that his small independent team of five open source architects and engineers and designers
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:04.980]   Are going to do better than people have been working on literally for the last decade
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.700]   Of the open web
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:12.500]   Exactly why no i'm not control get get get get the president off his back
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:15.780]   It gets if if it's a decentralized system
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:19.300]   Then twitter is no longer responsible for the content on twitter
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:23.140]   And so everybody who's been complaining that twitter net needs to do a better job
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.540]   patrolling and policing
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:31.860]   Uh the the people on the right who say twitter blocks conservative thought the people on the left who say twitter allows neo nazis
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:34.340]   Both will be shut up because
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.100]   Jack can say oh
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.100]   It's not my fault
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:43.460]   And in fact, I have to point out an activity pub mastodon specifically there are specific nazi
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.700]   uh
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:50.740]   Servers it's a federated system. So anybody could set up a server and there are nazi servers
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:53.700]   There are servers for escorts for prostitution
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:58.900]   Uh, and nobody's responsible for it. You don't have to follow it. You don't have to see it
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.380]   But because nobody's responsible for it
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.500]   Uh anything goes and I think that that's the real reason for this
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.540]   Dave whiner who created rss and has been very active in all of this in fact
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.940]   I remember dave
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.380]   has been
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.500]   lobbying twitter for some time to open up tweeted. I'd like to see twitter do this in a different way
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:23.380]   You already have the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:27.140]   Let's add a few apis and create a new universe in other words
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:33.140]   Let the the hub the core be the existing twitter servers, but create an api so people
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:36.820]   Can create their own apps create their own instances create their own
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:43.780]   Twitters in effect. I mean, this is exactly what twitter has been doing the opposite of for the last couple of years
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:47.060]   They've been shutting down their apis. They've not been letting developers access people
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.540]   They've removed rss feeds from twitter accounts
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:53.780]   And they've done everything basically to try and break
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.540]   Decentralization
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:00.580]   um as far as twitter goes and this is causing more problems if they want to
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:05.460]   Start with decentralization then they need to bring back the things that they've taken away
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:10.420]   and actually help developers because that's the only way that they're going to be able to
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:16.020]   Decentralize themselves and if they need to fix their harassment and abuse problems
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:24.100]   Which I think we can all agree that they do then they probably need to be looking at what other systems are already out there for headliness
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:29.860]   Because guess what this is not the first place on the internet that has had this problem and is dealing with this problem
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:34.260]   They may be dealing with it at a larger scale, but that doesn't mean it's
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:38.100]   Necessary to reinvent the wheel every time you run into the same problem
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.340]   You know what this reminds me of?
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.940]   You don't agree with me about control
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:44.180]   But I think that has something to do with that
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:50.340]   And if twitter wants to fix something give me 15 seconds to spell check myself when i'm typing angrily
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:55.220]   Real quick and I post something get fixed that for me before you go bring in your own team
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.020]   I disagree
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:57.220]   I just realized what's going on
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:01.140]   Okay, because I think one of the benefits of twitter is that people cannot edit their tweets
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:05.380]   The premise I just need 10 seconds when I say you
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:09.780]   I can't say what i'm saying posting and it actually going up is what you want
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:11.780]   Yeah, just give me 10 seconds
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:14.100]   You just get quick
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.100]   Yeah, like the undo fixer and gmail. Yeah
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:19.940]   Give me a second. I'm angry sometimes
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.540]   I'm type of fast
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:25.860]   And then everybody's they're missing my joke and my anger and and grammar and not seeing me
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:31.060]   And I can't take it because they're missing the whole point of the very astute thing that I tried to post on twitter
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.300]   Fix that. Yeah, go ahead Paris
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:40.980]   Oh, I was just saying then you're gonna miss the dopamine hit of getting likes a few seconds after you post
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:43.060]   What are you gonna do without those?
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:46.820]   I need that like you right I do
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.220]   Instagram told me I don't need likes anymore
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:53.140]   So i'm i'm starting to brave on his soldier on as an individual who doesn't
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.100]   Solidify and gratify themselves upon people clicking a button. Thank you instagram
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.260]   This reminds me of very much
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:04.260]   And it's not a surprise is mark zuckerberg's
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:09.460]   Announcement on facebook that they were going to create an end-to-end encrypted facebook
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.260]   Uh, it is for the same exact reasons twitter facebook
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:17.060]   Might stop facebook from doing that though
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.220]   Well, okay, then we'll talk about that
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:25.380]   That's another issue because they of course the law enforcement wants to be able to see into facebook because they think that's going to help them catch criminals
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:31.380]   Uh, but his idea of the end-to-end encryption was just like jack's idea of an open source
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:38.340]   A federated twitter is to evade responsibility for the problems that these platforms have created
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:42.180]   Uh, the coolest thing on facebook has been here
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:46.980]   That was real quick the coolest thing on facebook is when you're messaging a zuckerberg
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:53.300]   And uh, you go back and try to look at the messages and somehow yours and their messages have been deleted and you didn't do it
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:58.180]   And you're like, oh, okay. Cool. That's how we that's how we play it. Okay. They got special tools over there
[01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:04.020]   So that's really interesting when they do stuff like that facebook talked about and encryption did send
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.660]   uh, an open letter
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:12.980]   Uh to uh, us attorney bill bar and leaders in uk in australia
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:16.020]   uh, the letter was
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:22.180]   Written by will kathgart head of what's app and uh, stans shudnovsky the head of messenger
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:29.940]   Uh, responding to the request from the u.s the uk and the australian government for back doors in the encryption protocols
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:32.020]   remember bar gave a
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.620]   Speech saying they've got to do this. He's been lobbying hard for it as have
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:40.020]   Uh, the head of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:45.940]   This is the quote from uh kathkart and shudnovsky. It's simply impossible
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:48.980]   To create such a backdoor for one purpose
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:52.340]   Law enforcement and not expect others to try and open it
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:59.220]   You do this people's private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.260]   Weakens security this is not something we are prepared to do in other words
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:07.380]   They're saying no
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:11.860]   I don't know if they'll get to say no
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:15.220]   Yeah, and there's also the issue with um
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:27.140]   Was this yeah, this was earlier this week or last week. Um, the federal trade commission is reportedly considering seeking a preliminary injunction against facebook to prevent the
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.620]   Um, social network from integrating
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.660]   Facebook whatsapp and messenger services on the grounds that it might
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:41.220]   Uh, make it much harder slash impossible to break the company up if they do find that that's necessary
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:50.660]   I do you think the government should get involved in this or I mean honestly if you don't want that just don't use facebook
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:54:03.220]   Right, I mean at a certain point you can't not use facebook because if facebook buys every large competitor or major social media app or communication platform
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:07.780]   Um or creates its own version of it and grows larger and larger
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:15.220]   At a certain point you have to be connected to one of these services and that's kind of what they're trying to look at here is whether or not
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:20.900]   Facebook like I asked the oil companies of yesteryear have gotten too big
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:26.740]   And too powerful in a sense that it needs to be broken up in some sense and we're not sure of course what
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:31.300]   I just I understand that desire but boy, I really get nervous
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:36.020]   About the notion of breaking up these big tech companies because I just don't know if it can be done
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:43.060]   In a way, what's this facebook what does facebook have that we have to use though as currently constructed like
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:50.260]   Microsoft I get you need to use a computer you have apple, but like certain things like what is facebook owned currently that you
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:57.060]   Have to use like oil companies gas companies, you know certain things like you're you have to use them
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:03.300]   You do still have an option and not for nothing and it sounds horrible to say I say really quickly
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:09.780]   I don't want this government currently getting involved in this type of stuff and setting the rules in the forever any government
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:11.780]   I agree with any government
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.500]   I just I said real quick and just right now in this moment
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:19.300]   I just don't want major shakles having them right now under this regime currently. That's almost about that
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:23.300]   Well, what's what's it? I mean politicians in general don't understand. Oh, yeah
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.740]   They're all able to really be able to regulate it. They felt blockchain was the solution for the northern island border
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.460]   I
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.460]   Think that's is it all right
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:40.580]   Rosemary, are you originally from England? Yes, I'm originally from just outside of Bristol in the southwest of the UK
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.260]   What's what do you think about Boris Johnson's landslide victory?
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:50.100]   I would prefer not to talk about it for people who are listening. She just put her head in her hands
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:53.940]   I love the idea of Scotland being independent. I might move to Scotland
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.420]   That's where my people are from. I like that idea
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:05.140]   Well, it's just crazy. It's just but I guess my the reason I bring that up is
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:08.500]   Governments go through weird things. I don't think
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.740]   this government
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:15.060]   Next government any government should get to do things like that at the same time
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:23.380]   Government is the expression of us as a society and what we want these companies to do that's wholesome and best for our society
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:27.940]   I just feel like it's easy now not to use Facebook. I don't miss it at all
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:33.940]   And people didn't a chat say what's happened in certain countries. What's that is very very heavily
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:39.620]   I bet it's true in Austria, but certainly it's true in a lot of countries if you can't if you're not using what's up
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:42.260]   You can't communicate everybody else is using it
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:50.180]   They're not using text message. What's that is then merged with instagram and facebook and for a lot of people I mean
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:54.260]   At least one of those apps if not all three are kind of
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:57:02.020]   Necessary to function in social society if not just regular society you have to find a way to communicate with your friends and family
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:06.900]   All of your friends family co-workers whatnot are on facebook?
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.660]   I have a younger sister that's going to college and a lot of the
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:16.100]   I don't know classes will have facebook groups and information is shared in there or
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.380]   The only way to get invited to a certain party is if you're following this
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:22.660]   Account on instagram and for a lot of people
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:29.780]   These have become essential parts of everyday life and they should be tick-tock parties because instagram parties are lame
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:35.380]   But here's here's I'll give you an in that shell what worries me. This is not happening here. It's happening in India
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:40.980]   The indian government the moatie government has proposed ground baking rules to do something like gdpr
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:46.660]   This would require technology companies to gain the consent of citizens
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:52.100]   Before they could collect and process their personal data yay team right but wait
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:56.180]   But wait, there's more at the same time
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:02.340]   Companies would have to hand over non personal quote data of their users to the government
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:08.420]   And new deli would also hold the power to collect any data of its citizens without consent
[01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.620]   To serve the larger public interest
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:17.620]   The personal data protection bill of 2019 they're in a nutshell
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:21.700]   I rest my case because when they say break up big tech
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:26.580]   But let's make sure we get our piece of the pie. That's what worries me
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:34.580]   I mean facebook can already build a shadow profile of somebody who's only been mentioned like three times by first name or something
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:36.660]   I'm sure they have a big dossier
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:40.260]   So, you know
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:44.100]   Facebook managed that you know governments already have tons of information
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:47.460]   You know and they know that it's accurate for certificates
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:52.580]   Test certificates marriage certificates, you know when you moved in somewhere which place you're registered to live at
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:59.700]   Um all all of that information is something they already have combined that with information from you know social networks
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:07.220]   And suddenly you they can stalk everything you do and the question is why do they feel like they need this information
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:12.340]   Um, what are they going to do with it? How is this going to serve the larger public interest?
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:17.220]   This is the same indian government that just said a muslim cannot be an indian citizen
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:24.020]   So I don't think you have to stretch your imagination too far to imagine what the moaty government wants to do with this information
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:28.340]   And uncle leo then you wonder why i live in a black site. You know what i'm saying?
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:33.540]   Turn off the lights man. It's getting darker all the time. That's right. I don't that's right. I don't know what i'm doing
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:35.540]   I hear any street sentences. Yeah
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:40.340]   I'm about my look you can't find my phone. You can't find my house. You can't find my car
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:46.340]   You can't find my address. I'm I'm out here living off the grid but on the grid uncle leo and you could do it too
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:51.620]   Yes, because you're still you're still on this show you're making a very public appearance
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:53.860]   Unless you unless you're actually
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:58.820]   In a small white lady of 73 years old you might be I don't know
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:02.500]   Check out my facebook my facebook says I just turned 70 years old
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:05.860]   I'm a white man that lives in New York city and vacations in la
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:10.340]   So, I mean if you want to go check the stats my twitter also looks at me as a white 70 year old man
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:15.700]   Okay, my ads and they put out to me are not for me. Okay. I'm just saying if you want to try and look
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:18.820]   Try to get my drivers like my address you ain't gonna get me uncle leo
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:22.340]   I'm out here off the grid but on the grid uncle leo this close. I like
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:27.540]   Don't don't stand your side here. Don't don't don't don't bring care for me. Don't tempt people here
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:30.820]   I'm sorry for you
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.780]   I'm tempted. I'm trying. I'm trying
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:38.100]   I'm looking forward to a day when starlink elon musk's
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:45.460]   42,000 satellite array is blocking all astronomy but giving me high speed internet at every corner of the world
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:48.580]   That will be wonderful. That will be the day
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:51.220]   Hey, let's talk about socks
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:55.940]   Want to talk about socks? We had I was saying how we have all these privacy sponsors
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.060]   Let's take a break from privacy and talk about foot
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:00.980]   footwear
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:06.260]   The best socks I have ever had I do you know about bombas? I love bombas
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:11.140]   Uh bombas make socks that are just super soft crazy cozy
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:18.420]   They look great. They're stylish men don't have a whole lot of ways to show off our our plumeage
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:23.940]   You know, I could buy a funny necktie or I can wear crazy ass socks from bombas
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:27.700]   But these are I wish you could feel this because they're not only look great

[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:54.420]   literally getting rid of all my other socks
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:02:00.660]   And replacing it with bombas and I and I have to do that because now there's a corner of my sock drawer
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:06.020]   Where all the neglected unused socks go and I just always pick the bombas out
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:08.980]   So I know it's time. This would be a great gift
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.940]   It's not too late to give bombas for the holidays bombas calm slash twit b o m b a s

[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:30.260]   These don't slide around and fall off the really stay on
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:37.300]   And and you can wear your you know your pumps or your heels or your loafers without socks looks like you're not wearing socks

[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:56.340]   Um, I was going and helped out at um shelters, especially in LA or um
[02:03:57.220 --> 02:04:01.780]   New York where it gets cold and it rains it sucks or people want socks when they want shoes
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:07.620]   Socks are just so hard to come by keep dry like it was it was it was amazing to me

[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:21.060]   I didn't I didn't know so that makes me feel good
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:24.180]   Uh new Orleans
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.940]   I this story broke this morning brought to its knees
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:32.740]   By ransomware. It's not clear exactly what happened. This is from
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:35.460]   Nola.com
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:38.740]   Uh, it's kind of scary this happened on friday, new Orleans officials
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:42.340]   sought to contain a cyber attack against its network
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.900]   It started in the early morning
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:47.380]   Uh
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:49.380]   So what happened?
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.260]   It appears to have started 5 a.m
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:58.580]   city officials first noted quote suspicious activity on their network employees got to work around 8 a.m
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:00.820]   at 11 a.m
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:08.500]   Announcements over the city hall public address system saying turn off your computer turn off your computer unplug your computer
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:11.940]   the uh the
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:16.340]   Folks at the city hall said this is the advice we got from our federal and state partners
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:19.380]   That's the way our security team has been trained to respond
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:25.220]   city technology officials then went from floor to floor to confirm all systems were offline
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:30.980]   Now the headline says ransomware, but it's but they're also saying
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:33.780]   that the city systems
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.020]   Uh, no data has been lost. No passwords were compromised
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:43.460]   In influx of suspicious emails mean the city systems would be kept offline
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:46.980]   Uh indefinitely
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:50.500]   So what it sounds like is they got flooded by fishing attempts
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:55.300]   But no city employees fell for it
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:58.580]   They had cyber training last fall
[02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:05.140]   And so it's not clear if ransomware was installed or had begun to encrypt anything with the city is saying we didn't lose anything
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:10.740]   This has been of course a hot spot for ransomware lately as city governments school systems
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:13.460]   Uh often they have insurance
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:18.100]   Often they're desperate to get back online, which means they're much more likely to pay the bitcoin ransom
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:22.100]   To ransomware attackers. We don't know anything more than that, but
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:24.900]   yet another uh
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.900]   ransomware hit pretty amazing
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.620]   Were they still running windows xp?
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:38.500]   You mock but i'm but probably they were i mean i'm not mocking i work for a technical university and we do still have
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:46.340]   machines running windows xp, but they are also isolated on our network and we have them because they are attached to extremely expensive pieces of equipment
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:53.140]   Which you don't just replace like that because the the operating system that is attached to the machine the
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:58.900]   You need to use it is out of date, but they are also isolated and for a very good reason
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:02.500]   Um, but i always wonder with things like this, you know
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:05.620]   Where where is the hole that somebody got in?
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.220]   Um, you know, obviously it's usually a person rather than
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.980]   um, a system, you know somebody falling for a fishing attempt or something, but
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.700]   You know there there would have to be a
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:19.860]   Series of errors. I would hope to for something like that to happen
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:22.260]   nowadays
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:26.500]   So, uh, this was a great story that unfortunately fizzled
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:33.620]   Uh at a uh, desk a tech crunch disrupt in berlin samsung electronics president young sones says
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:37.140]   We've sold 1 million galaxy fold phones
[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:42.820]   These are the 2 000 beta phones that didn't work when they first sent them out
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:49.060]   To who is the question to who well now samsung has come back and said yeah, he made a mistake
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.700]   That's our that's our goal

[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:52.340]   I'm the same way. It's also a new phone from palm. I thought palm died
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:55.300]   but uh
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:59.860]   So cute phone from war delt to that little pocket first phone didn't yeah, it's like tiny

[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:13.780]   Yeah, it's designed. It's the size of a credit card designed for life on the go
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:16.340]   It's the world that kit. This is a joke
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.820]   No, that's a real thing
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:20.900]   3.3 inch display
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:23.780]   I'm sorry
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.780]   Who is palm these days?
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:27.780]   So the way they pitch that phone is
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.340]   Let's say you're um
[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:32.340]   You're a busy person who runs a studio
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:36.420]   But you just want to go out to dinner and you don't want to take the four phones that you have to review
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:38.420]   I like taking all my phones
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.420]   You just take the palm out with you for dinner
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:41.460]   Just for dinner
[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:43.460]   You could take a couple of pictures with a answer a couple of texts
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:45.460]   That's why it's a dinner phone
[02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:47.460]   It's a dinner phone for
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:52.340]   The little tiny person when they're out looking pretty and they just pop it in there or if you're worn out curry and you're short
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:55.220]   And you're a tiny basketball player making fun of war mail
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:57.860]   Aks
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:00.740]   He wears around his neck like a little necklace like we're got
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:04.340]   Hate stuff for you. The phone that will actually fit in a woman's pocket
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:08.420]   Yeah, the only phone that I want is the baby phone
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:15.220]   My coworker, luise met zakies reviewed this she found it in hong kong in like a random supermarket that she went to
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:20.020]   Um, once you if you look up wired baby phone, it'll come up
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:24.100]   It is like a no-kiyanaka phone that is oh, yeah, I have one of those
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.220]   Yeah
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.580]   Like the size of two of my thumbs put together maybe a bit smaller
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.180]   What
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:35.380]   I love all you can do just call it and receive texts and texts and all caps back
[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:37.860]   No, there's one more thing you can do you can play snake
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:38.740]   I see that too
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:39.540]   It has a snake
[02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:44.180]   It's wonderful. Yeah, wait, which version of snakes is a happy original
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:47.460]   Yeah, really original really really original
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:49.860]   So if you run into a wall, you die. Yeah
[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:54.020]   Which on a tiny screen is hard. I was I bet it's really hard
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:57.700]   I bought this it was like 30 bucks
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:59.220]   Because you let it go boop you dead
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:02.980]   luise showed it to us on
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.860]   Yeah, I bought it immediately
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:13.220]   Uh, her says no kia even though it's not no kia and uh and mine did not it not yeah, not it's a knockoff
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:16.740]   Um, but I actually slipped it into a friend's purse
[02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:20.420]   And I've never seen since
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:22.980]   Talk about gps tracking
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:25.380]   Oh man, I don't think this has gps
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:27.060]   I bet
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:31.220]   It's a battery on it. Uh, I don't know but guess what it's removable it lasted for days
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:36.100]   Yeah, I was gonna say that battery lasted 14 years straight. Nope. No recharge
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:41.620]   You could totally get two of those phones and just like wear them as earrings and it would it work
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:47.700]   Did you see the phone that they picked up out of the concrete the no key phone and it didn't mean the concrete and then they charged it up
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:49.700]   It is still work of course
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:52.180]   No, no phones last forever
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:55.940]   I'm buying me this palm phone right now
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:13:02.740]   I mean it's actually affordable as well considering the price is you know, I compared to the
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:07.140]   $2,000 Samsung fold yeah, you know, this is
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:11.540]   You know, this is really spencer in the cheap, but who is Paul?
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:17.300]   You made a big mistake. You should have gave our christmas bonuses. You could have been handing out little palms all over the studio
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:21.700]   It's not too late. Let's get this for all the hosts. They would be so happy
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:25.780]   Let's do it. I want I want to see aunt hold this phone up and make a phone call like that
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:28.980]   I want to see his big mitts with this
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:32.500]   He wouldn't be able to hold it. It would for slippers fingers
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:38.420]   All day battery life 32 gigs of storage 12 megapixel camera
[02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:44.180]   Wow, this is this is you can even buy it with a power bundle which includes a mophie battery case
[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:48.820]   If mophie's making accessories for calm like this this is like a real thing
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:55.220]   The phone's old to it's been out for a year. So we're not oh it is. Oh, I thought this I never saw this before
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:14:00.180]   You just like I said war delb it advertised before for a little bit. It might not have been a year
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:03.940]   I saw steady courage to enhance for like six months. Yeah
[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:05.860]   Last year
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:08.980]   Had to have another phone attached to it to for it to work
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:15.860]   Really stupid why would you want a phone that needs a phone? It's a side car, but they they
[02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:17.860]   They told you that you go out to dinner
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:21.620]   Yeah, but you can't leave your phone at home. You need both of them
[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:24.660]   So I actually used to have a phone
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:28.260]   And it was a kickstarter project and it looked like one of those pocket
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:30.500]   Calculators that people had back in the 90s
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:34.260]   And the idea was that you came with a case and you would put it on the back of your phone
[02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:36.340]   And it was for a second sim card
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:42.260]   And the idea was then you could just receive messages and calls on it, but you wouldn't have to carry two separate phones
[02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:46.420]   However, I never got the darn thing to work properly. So that was a kickstarter fail
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:49.540]   Is it isn't a simple phone or something? What's that phone?
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:51.940]   That yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:54.980]   Was that called simple? I think it sounds simple. Okay
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:57.540]   so uh
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.700]   Paris wrote a
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:05.220]   Big piece the definitive piece the ultimate piece on the wired guide to influencers
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:11.220]   Everything you need to know about it. You forgot about it already. You haven't you Paris you've moved on?
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.780]   No, I did not this
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:15.460]   This was
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:18.500]   So many days of my life. This is yeah, this is your life's work here
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:21.620]   It really is. I mean it's less about
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:25.620]   I think we traditionally think of as a guide to influencers
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:29.300]   There's no like lists of top people on youtube or
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:35.860]   Instagram and it's instead about one kind of the nebulous concept that is an influencer, you know, it's both
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:44.740]   We use this word to both refer to uh, like megas celebrities and teens the thousand followers as well as you kind of use it as an insult
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:49.860]   And as some people's life goals to be an influencer and digs into that as well as the um
[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:53.780]   kind of secret history of influencers, which I
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:59.220]   When I was first assigned this piece normally wired guides have like, you know a big intro piece
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:04.340]   They have a history of the thing and future and I was like guys, please don't make your art a history
[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:09.300]   It's not gonna be interesting. It's like 10 years. Like I really don't want to you know
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:13.540]   Just write about who is on instagram and then I started looking into it and I was like wait
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:16.260]   Like the history of influencers actually goes back to the 90s
[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:21.940]   As far as early like web blogs early message boards and whatnot people were
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:29.460]   Kind of trolling these early web message boards to find influential posters and to pay them to seed their
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:31.300]   No kidding
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:36.580]   Feed their accounts with kind of ads for brand. So it's one thing to be somebody people listen to
[02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:42.020]   For recommendations and that's been going on as long as the world has been going on
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:48.420]   What's made them influencers is that the advertisers are now seeking them out and saying if you would mention our product
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:52.100]   We will give you $10,000. That's that's really the definition
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:54.100]   and that these people are
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:59.300]   Unique in that they are different than celebrities or even like one-off viral sensations
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:02.660]   They're people who have come to prominence
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:09.220]   Through some means of like technology on the internet or online somehow by kind of organically posting and sharing
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:12.180]   And if to be an influencer you have to have
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:20.100]   In some way the respect or the respect of your peers or someone has to value your expertise on something to consider you influential
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:21.940]   and
[02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:25.860]   People are advertisers and brands are paying attention to that and there's big money in it
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:29.860]   I remember pay per post you talk about that. That was 15 years ago
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:34.500]   Yeah, where they would pay you to go out and write a post about something
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:40.820]   So the thing that I found absolutely fascinating about this because I had totally forgotten but um
[02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:45.940]   Trying to find it when I was trying to find this kind of history to influencers. I was looking back to okay
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:50.340]   When we're kind of the first big mainstream instances of companies
[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:54.580]   Kind of engaging in influencer marketing and one of them was this
[02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:55.780]   uh
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:03.620]   Company who's mind comment was the early name of it who they had this network that they pair with bloggers or find out influential people on
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:08.820]   Friendster or message boards and pay them to post eventually this turned into a company called
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:15.140]   Paper post and they partnered with a lot of prominent web bloggers and people online generally were
[02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:17.780]   Fury. Oh, yeah, I cannot
[02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:20.340]   Under emphasize how oh I was
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:27.060]   Shocked and upset. Yeah, everyone was at the near idea that anyone could even be paid
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:31.460]   By a company to post anything or speak about advertising
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:35.860]   And then something that I've been thinking about a lot actually during the subset of twit is that
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:40.340]   one of the biggest scandals during this time was that 2006 was um
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:44.260]   a bunch of like influential tech bloggers at the time
[02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:46.420]   reported that
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:48.420]   Shocking. Oh my god
[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:55.780]   Google of all place or no it was like microsoft somebody had sent microsoft had sent them a new ace or laptop
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.820]   And said you could review them. You could not it's just free
[02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:08.500]   And this was apparently the biggest scandal of the year everyone was outraged at the idea that microsoft would send bloggers a free
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:14.180]   Multi-thousand-dollar laptop it was the most unethical thing they'd ever heard of and I was like today
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:16.820]   I mean, that doesn't even say this bat
[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:18.500]   No
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:21.700]   They're right at check for I mean today is considered like a mark of being
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:26.340]   I don't know like a blogger or something if you get sent a product by a company to review
[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:28.740]   Regardless of whether or not you need to return it
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.140]   Um, you know, it's considered
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:39.380]   It's considered like a sign that you are a real blogger those youtube stars who got the you know, $50,000
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:42.500]   Mac prose and did those videos
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:47.940]   That's a huge set of status and I'm gonna guess not one of them said anything bad about it
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:52.820]   Yeah, not one of them. Now those aren't reviews anymore. Those are
[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.300]   paid posts
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:58.980]   And honestly, I think you you may say we tolerated now paris
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:05.860]   But most people when they use the word influencer that is a pejorative. That is a negative term. You're an influencer
[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:12.340]   Right, but everybody realizes how many people are technically influencers like your favorite
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:14.820]   Youtuber that reviews a bunch of tech gadgets
[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:21.780]   Somebody that you follow on instagram. You really like their style or love their photos of I don't know like
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.660]   Oh, honestly
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:29.620]   Everything they tag in there. They're probably getting money for we used to start we used to I mean
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:32.340]   We used to get a lot of stuff for review from companies
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:35.620]   And it's why I established policies that we say we you know, we
[02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:39.060]   We will not accept it for you unless you send us a return label
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.660]   We'll keep it for a specific period of time two weeks. We'll send it back
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:49.460]   And for the most part the stuff we review I buy because I don't want to but you know what it doesn't matter
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:53.540]   Nobody cares. I'm sure we're tired with the same brushes everybody else that osmo
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:57.700]   Mini I bought that. I mean these you know my iPhone I bought my max
[02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:03.300]   I bought my pixel for about and I buy it for our reviewers too because I don't want to be
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:04.900]   uh
[02:21:04.900 --> 02:21:07.220]   In that you know pay pay for play
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:12.180]   Space but the truth is marca's brownly still gets more hits than I do
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:14.740]   It doesn't seem to matter at all
[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:20.980]   And it it doesn't because the thing is the way the system works now, especially with um
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.860]   YouTube like this light per se
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:26.980]   It's made by aperture and before even was for sale
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:31.700]   All the youtubers reviewed the same lights you see 30 different people reviewing the light
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:34.740]   And if it's a good product is going to make people buy it
[02:21:34.740 --> 02:21:41.460]   And that's just the way that it works. The new wave of influence is so different and sometimes subtle and sometimes overbearing
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.380]   But it works
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:49.620]   The number one idea about being on this show is when randomly like right now when we talk about influence and I I would mention how
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:51.940]   I make money off of
[02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:55.380]   Instagram selling accounts people always want to know how I do it
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:59.940]   And what the procedure is and I usually tell them and I just say it right here really quick
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:02.580]   So next time somebody asked me I can say check out the episode so
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:08.180]   I had no idea you did this have you mentioned this before oh, I've mentioned like four or five times from where we're talking about
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:11.140]   Obviously not page paying attention. No, no, no
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:16.260]   What does that mean? What does that mean? Nobody cares you create you create accounts and sell them?
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:20.660]   I make accounts. I get it up to 300,000 followers
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:24.180]   And I sell to someone how do you get up to 300,000 followers?
[02:22:24.180 --> 02:22:27.060]   I'm about to tell you the system. You want to hear the system?
[02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:30.660]   I got about to tell you how to do it. I never got more than 33,000 followers
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:33.940]   All right, I'm about to tell you how to do without having to buy followers
[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:35.460]   And I'm a real person
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:39.700]   You're a real person. Let's say you got zero followers. All right. Yeah, you open up Instagram account
[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:42.820]   You got zero followers. All you have to do is find a meme account
[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:48.180]   Or a pretty young girl and tell them hey, I'll pay you 20 bucks if you
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.860]   Post my account on instagram you make your account private
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:56.500]   You put 10 posts up there or either memes of funny videos or 10 hot girls
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:01.460]   You're going to get literally inundated with requests and people can't see what the content is
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.340]   You never accept the request within the first 48 hours
[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:07.220]   You wait long enough to people forget that they even sent a request
[02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:10.020]   You sit there for a little bit. You accept all the requests next thing
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:14.260]   You know you got two 3000 followers you do that process again after like a hundred bucks
[02:23:14.260 --> 02:23:17.460]   You're probably up to maybe about 10,000 followers. Do you ever go public?
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:20.820]   Oh, I all this is private. I don't let anyone know that
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:24.100]   You know, they've seen these posts so far
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:27.460]   Oh, no, no, you have to have it private because when people go click on it
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:31.780]   They'll go see you only have 10 posts or they'll watch your 10 videos and then they'll never follow you
[02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:37.780]   But if someone if someone viable posts you then you sell it and then once if you did it yourself
[02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:38.660]   Which is what I've done
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:40.180]   You bought a one account this big enough
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.980]   Then I could refer myself to new accounts build the accounts up
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:48.100]   And then you sell the accounts off to people that want them and just want the numbers and then they could reput their name on it
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:50.100]   Who's buying these celebrities or
[02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:55.460]   Sometimes regular people sometimes small businesses and then you start on that business and you want to have followers
[02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:59.060]   They go public after they buy it from you. They they make they take all your
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.380]   Stupid posts
[02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:04.020]   They delete everything off of it, but we have
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:06.020]   1000 followers. Yes
[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:09.540]   There was a really good
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:14.900]   Article of red on medium earlier this year about how somebody eats for free in New York City using python
[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:22.580]   Artificial intelligence and instagram and essentially he has a whole series of scripts where he follows people and then they follow him back
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:27.060]   And then after a while he unfollows them because there's a maximum number of people that you can follow
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:32.100]   And then he ends up with a massive number of followers and he gets deep for free
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:36.580]   He just goes into the restaurant and says ci have 300,000 followers. I'm an influencer
[02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:41.940]   Yeah, which I mean to me does not feel good. It's the same way
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:46.020]   It's you know like what you say Leo with you know people sending you free products to review
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:49.540]   I prefer to buy stuff myself. So I looked at this and I was like huh
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:56.340]   Interesting like from an automation perspective. I was really intrigued. Yeah how he was doing this amazing way you can do with python
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:25:00.900]   Yeah, and there are and there are programs you can pay for and get likes and stuff like that
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:04.100]   But those usually bots are not you're not buying you're not these aren't bots
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:08.740]   No, I get I get real people to follow my counsel at least they're real people
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:13.300]   It takes me a little longer, but they're regular people and usually the hot girl thing works the most
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:17.460]   It's a pretty big problem. It takes us a little longer, but they're real people
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:20.260]   Well
[02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:22.900]   Yeah, it's that's that's the way I look at it because again
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:27.380]   You could pay for systems that do a lot of automation for you and you're getting a lot of bots
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:33.060]   But you know that's also not useful because when a person comes and looks at it and they see that there's so many fake accounts
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:34.980]   There's no engagement that doesn't help you either
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:39.220]   And of course you have to expect some kind of drop off once people realize that they're following a
[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:43.300]   mom and pop cooking channel or something after six months, so
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:44.980]   you know
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:46.740]   It's amazing
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:50.660]   Yeah, I always found the less I posted on instagram the more followers I would get
[02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:55.220]   Since I post the same thing with twitter since you post something they go. I don't want to follow that guy
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:00.020]   Well, we've all learned something here today. Thanks to uh, thanks to our panel
[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:03.540]   Uh thrilled to have you rosemary orchard come back soon. Will you?
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:09.380]   Oh, definitely. Thank you for having me. I really enjoyed it. Is there anything you can't do with automator and shortcuts?
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:17.140]   I mean automator itself is kind of limited but switch it for keyboard maestro and your hello keyboard maestro. That's your secret
[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:20.420]   Yeah, you do regular coding too though, right?
[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:23.300]   Yeah, yeah, I'm a PHP programmer by day
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:30.020]   So I program for the web so I find that frustrating if you've coded with a real language. I find some of these toy languages
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:34.100]   Frustrating because it's different. You can't figure out how to do something
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:36.580]   It's like well, where's my for loop?
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.860]   I don't have a for loop. No, you don't repeat with each
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:45.940]   Thank you so much rosemary orchard.com and her podcasts also on
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:48.660]   replay or sorry relay.fm
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:54.340]   Uh the automator. I like that the automator and we'll get you back on real soon. I

[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:06.500]   Ooh, that sounds like good fun. I am always a for chocolate cake of any kind. We're taking a river boat from buddha pest to munic
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:11.140]   And I believe that vena is in the way. So we'll have to go go through it
[02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:18.020]   You you really bought into that whole experiences over items thing boy. You are no I haven't bought this
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:22.900]   I didn't live it myself

[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:31.620]   And I have my riverboat trip

[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.380]   Uh

[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:54.820]   I just throw out once a month
[02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:57.780]   But uh, I just like to remind you that it is the holiday season
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:02.020]   Break those phones out with grandma and get a story about what she grew up
[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:04.340]   Ask her about her for this job. Yes
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:12.340]   Remember all the things that you need to know about your family one project that I will be doing is instead of doing all these wedding photographers
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:15.540]   I personally am going to start a little small project of
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:19.780]   Home movies where I go and interview mother husband
[02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:27.300]   Video the kids interview the grandparents put it together like you would a wedding movie and do a nice experience and then hopefully
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.460]   Will smith or somebody takes me on her trip or maybe uncle leo takes me to viana
[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:35.780]   I get the video team family the background. It's together. Yeah, movie
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:41.540]   You know, so you have to remember that time in 4k. I can't do 6k or 8k unless we get to 52 000
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:45.220]   Mac but in 4k I can put together a nice little video in your family
[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:48.100]   You should do it at home. You're such a hot phone to do it
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:51.060]   You're a hoehead and videotape if you remind me of dolomite
[02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:53.140]   You're the dolomite of the tech here
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:57.700]   Uncle leo we can't all be as smart and as wonderful and create an empire like you
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:01.620]   So all I can do is drag on your coattails and get a free hustle. I love your hustle
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:06.100]   Get a video channel family. I mean, you got the camera. Let me take the picture
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:10.340]   You're out there with the galafagos. You don't need to be taking selfies with the
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:16.580]   Camera you gotta focus on I like taking selfies with the blue-fitted boobies. That's part of my part of the fun
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:20.100]   I can tell an instagram knows it too. Oh, it does
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:23.780]   I have given up on instagram as well as facebook

[02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:58.500]   Okay, boomer
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:10.100]   Dr. Do you want to give us a final farewell rant
[02:32:13.060 --> 02:32:18.260]   Is there anything it's on your mind these days? The only thing I want to rant about is what I was saying earlier
[02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:19.700]   um
[02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:20.740]   people
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:22.180]   Have the power
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:22.820]   to
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:24.580]   Record things that are important
[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:29.620]   And it seems like when something bad you'll see the comments everybody wants to talk about something bad
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:32.020]   You post something good people don't really have anything to say
[02:32:32.020 --> 02:32:36.820]   So even in your own world just take the time to actually talk to your kids
[02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:40.340]   Record conversations talk to your parents record those conversations
[02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:46.100]   I watched the video of the interview I did with my dad and he passed away seven years ago. I watched it so much
[02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:50.340]   Once every couple years that just makes me feel good. It makes my daughter feel good watching it
[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:54.740]   About when he first went to prom and his first job and when he joined the military
[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:56.420]   And have a so like that's important to me
[02:32:56.420 --> 02:32:59.620]   So I know like once a year I say it and some people like oh man you keep harping on it
[02:32:59.620 --> 02:33:03.220]   But I feel like people need to do it and it's important and at this time of the year
[02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:08.260]   It's a great time to say it because everybody's around family and friends and everybody's generally happy
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:14.340]   You know with the new year and christmas so that's not a rant of negativity is a rant of positivity
[02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:20.500]   Record and share these moments so you have them instead of just sharing cat videos all the time
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:23.380]   What is it? What is it the young say word?
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:26.340]   Words on words
