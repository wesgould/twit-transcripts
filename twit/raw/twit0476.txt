[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.720]   The show that covers the Tech news.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.480]   Boy, it's been a big week.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.640]   I'm still sleep deprived.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.200]   Waiting in line at the iPhone store for hours and hours.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.640]   Fortunately, all I have to do is sit back
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520]   'cause we have one of those panels where,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.880]   if I get a word in Edge-wise, I'll be damn lucky.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.920]   We're gonna start off with Jason Snell,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.080]   lately detached from Macworld Magazine and IDG now.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.160]   - I'm a free agent, baby.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.200]   - He's a free agent at sixcolors.com, cleverly named.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   - Thank you.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.880]   - I like it.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.720]   I know what the six colors are.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   - Yes, that's the old Apple rainbow.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.840]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.680]   - And there was a great video about Steve Jobs talking about.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.760]   - Hey, congratulations. - Thank you.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.520]   - I'm really happy for you.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.160]   I think this is good for you and...
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.000]   - I'm having a time.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.520]   - We'll talk about what happened to Macworld 'cause I'm curious.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.920]   John C. Dvorak's also here.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   He still writes for print magazines.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.000]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   - Are there some left?
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.680]   - No.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.520]   (laughing)
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360]   - I still turn them in, though.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.680]   (laughing)
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.720]   - I think PC Magazine Brazil is still in paper.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   - No.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.000]   - No, that's been long gone, actually.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.680]   I gotta turn this, how did I start?
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.200]   Let me get this.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.440]   - John likes to watch the show.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.600]   - No, he's watching his own livestream.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.080]   - No, I was going onto the chat room so I could say hello.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.920]   - Oh, good.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.740]   - That's nice.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.580]   - Anyway, it's good to be here.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.420]   - Nice to have you.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.560]   - Yeah, you have your, you got two of these iPhones.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.480]   - Actually, we have four 'cause Jason brought his two.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.320]   - Four.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.160]   - We have many iPhones.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   - And there's a bunch of the back.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   - And there's a bunch of the back.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.160]   - There's a bunch in the back
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.760]   and also here Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.360]   He's got his.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.560]   You opted for the little one.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920]   - Yes, I have tried plate with the big one
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.200]   and it's just too big.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.080]   I carry my phone like in my shirt pocket around
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.600]   and the big one would be like this, right?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.760]   - Yeah.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.800]   - I need to, and I'm trying real hard
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.920]   to get myself breast cancer so far I haven't done it
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800]   but this baby ought to do it.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.040]   - Yeah, baby.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   No, I couldn't keep this in my breast pocket,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.640]   even the big one.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.240]   But I'm used to it.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.120]   - It's easier to get to.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.680]   I hate getting it out of my jeans, you know, or something.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.880]   - I think it's dashing.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   It looks like a little pocket square.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   And if you put the camera side out,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.040]   people run from it.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.880]   - You make people nervous.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.200]   - Yes, they're nervous.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.680]   (laughing)
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.640]   - Actually, I thought you were gonna get the black.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   - There is no black.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.040]   That's black front and space.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.880]   - That's gray back.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.720]   - That is great.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.560]   - I thought that was as cool as that.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   - I thought that was as cool as that.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   - I actually thought the goal was nice.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.240]   There were very constrained supplies.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.160]   I was 41st in line at our local Apple store.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   Got up at three in the morning shocked to see
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.400]   there were people there since eight in the evening
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.360]   or earlier.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.960]   There were hundreds in line.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.120]   It was the longest line I'd seen in quite some time.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.480]   I think there was a lot of demand for this iPhone.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.000]   - Yeah, and you could also order it online if you wanted to.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.280]   I mean, I got mine delivered the next.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.600]   - Well, I had to wait till like 4.30 in the afternoon.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.440]   - Oh, no!
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   - Like a monster, like an animal.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.160]   - Why don't you be doing the morning in 4.30?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.920]   - Set up a webcam so I could just monitor my front door
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.520]   so I could be there in the moment.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.800]   - I actually thought up at midnight on Friday morning,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.880]   last Friday, and I couldn't get into the Apple store.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.800]   I kept pounding it.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.120]   The Apple store was crowded,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.920]   but I gave up at midnight.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.560]   I went from midnight to one,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.640]   and I did finally go to Verizon.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   I got one on Verizon.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.240]   I got one for my mom on Sprint that night.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.360]   But I thought, and you know,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.600]   it's fun to get in the Apple line
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.800]   and you meet interesting people.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   - Oh yeah.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.960]   - It's a very diverse line these days.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.920]   - I can't imagine anyone more interesting
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   than someone to be in a line since Tuesday
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   waiting to buy a phone.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.560]   - That's gotta be the most interesting people
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.640]   you've ever run across.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.280]   - Okay, I'll give you an example.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.200]   - Okay. - I can give you an example.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.040]   - I'm here.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.400]   - And they're talking to a guy.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.160]   We find out we're Yale classmates,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.920]   class of 1977.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   - That tells you everything you need to know about Yale.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.240]   - The guy, the guy works at MIT Media Lab.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.640]   His mentors were Marvin Minsky.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.840]   - Yeah, I met Marvin.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   - Yeah, brilliant guy and Seymour Pappert
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.800]   and Timothy Leary.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640]   - Uh huh.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.960]   - I mean, it was fascinating.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.400]   But there's a variety of people now.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.440]   - You're on these, you spent a lot of time with Leary.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.280]   - Yeah.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.120]   - Yes.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.640]   - Anyway, he actually showed me his app.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.600]   He's working on a very interesting AR app.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.920]   So, which we'll probably have him on once it comes out.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.680]   So, I agree with you Dwight.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.520]   Believe it or not,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   I thought I was gonna want the Six Plus
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   'cause I'd used Android,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.240]   giant Android phones for the last few years.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   And I kinda liked the little, what do you think, Jason?
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.200]   - Well, I mean, the one I've got the review unit of the Six Plus,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.920]   but this is the one I bought and it's the,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.640]   it's the knowing full well.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.480]   - You were one.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.120]   - Having used both of them, I bought the Six.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.760]   - Yeah, you know, I think there are people
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.600]   for whom the Six Plus is gonna be perfect
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.920]   because it's got longer battery life,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.320]   because it's got a bigger screen.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   Anybody who has vision problems,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.400]   there's basically a large print mode
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.600]   that'll scale everything up so everything's bigger.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.840]   Instead of there being more, it's just bigger.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.440]   The camera is a little bit bigger.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.120]   Like I said, the battery life is a lot bigger.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.680]   And for some people, two-handed use,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   which is really what it's for, is fine.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.080]   They don't use their phone one-handed and they can get by.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.920]   It's not for me.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.760]   It's not for me.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.920]   My understanding is that there are parts of the world,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.040]   especially in Asia, where there are a lot of people
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.200]   who only have one computing device and it's their phone.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.680]   They don't have a tablet, they don't have a laptop,
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.600]   they just have their phone.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   And for them, they want that battery
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.440]   and they want that big screen.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.760]   But it's not, the thing that shocked me is that
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.720]   I was kind of hoping it would be a mini,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.560]   like a nano iPad and it's not, it's a big phone.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.040]   Most of there are a couple iPad features.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.560]   Well, it doesn't do a bunch of stuff that the iPad does.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.280]   It doesn't have any of those kind of like
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.040]   the finger gestures or things like that.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.720]   It's 16 by nine instead of four by three,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.080]   which means you use it in landscape mode
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.960]   and it'll give you something that sort of looks like an iPad
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.920]   interface except above the keyboard,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.560]   there's almost no space for anything.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.400]   Whereas on the iPad, it goes a lot wider in that dimension.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.440]   So I don't know, it's a big phone.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.280]   It's just a big phone.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.800]   If you want a big phone and it wanted to be an iPhone,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   you can do that now.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.240]   I think some people are, it's gonna be their favorite iPhone
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   ever, but I think it's gonna be a niche thing
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.880]   and not for most people.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.720]   - It is kind of funny.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   I mean, they went from the smallest phones in the market today
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.320]   to one of the biggest.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   I mean, that's a big jump from four inches
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.160]   to five and a half inches.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.640]   - I mean, they saw how the Samsung Galaxy Note sells,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   especially in Asia and they wanted to be there.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   And I mean, from Apple's perspective,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.800]   I think Apple really believes that the only part
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   of the high end phone market that they don't rule on
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.160]   are these phones in sizes where they don't have competitors.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.720]   And so I think from their perspective,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.040]   they're like, we're gonna sweep in there
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.360]   and take those customers back from Samsung.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   We'll see if that happens.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.520]   - Jason, does the keyboard on the six plus
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.640]   do the thing that the iPad keyboard does
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.160]   where you can split it into two sides?
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.480]   - That's another one of those features
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.080]   that just isn't, it's an iPad feature and it's not in there.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.800]   They added some keys to the sides of the six plus
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.680]   in landscape mode, but you can't do a split keyboard,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.120]   which I think is a mistake because you gotta really
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.440]   stretch your thumbs to, if you're thumb typing on the six plus.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.720]   - Well, even on the six, I wound up having to rearrange
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.120]   my icons so that all of the most used apps
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.880]   were at the bottom of the screen.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.400]   I did that with folders on the second screen.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.520]   And I actually, although when I hold the five now,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.640]   it seems small, when I'm working with this,
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   I kind of miss the smaller size.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.320]   I mean, I almost wish they made a six
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.800]   that was the standard four-inch size.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.320]   I think they still would be people buying that.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.280]   - So I have a theory.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.160]   I mean, this year they came out with these two new phones,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   the six and the six plus.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   I'm not 100% convinced that the five and that size
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.440]   is just gonna fade away into oblivion.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.240]   There's nothing stopping Apple from updating that size
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.880]   in the future, maybe next year,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.600]   with something they might call a five,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.000]   they might call a six C, who knows what they'll do,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.200]   but I don't know if Apple's gonna abandon that.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   They didn't update it this year,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.000]   but I don't know if they're gonna abandon the four-inch size.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.960]   If you think about it this way, yeah, it's not new,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   but they have three sizes in their iPhone line.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.400]   They've got the-- - They still sell the five.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.640]   - They still sell the five S and the five C.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.080]   So those phones are still available.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.160]   They just didn't do new versions of them this year.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.120]   - Molly Wood in the New York Times said that the iPhone six
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.920]   is too small and the iPhone six plus is too big,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.600]   which is there was something in the middle.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.040]   - What is she use it for?
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.800]   I don't know. - I don't know.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.200]   - I think the six feels pretty good.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.280]   It takes a little getting used to if you're used to
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.040]   like an iPhone five, but I think it,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.160]   because it's thinner and because the edges are rounded,
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.480]   including the screen, the actual glass on the top
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   is rounded. - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.680]   - It doesn't feel enormous.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.720]   It feels different, but not enormous compared to the five.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.440]   - I actually think four seven is a sweet spot.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.760]   I used a Moto X for a long time and that was four seven.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.360]   And it just ergonomically, I think that's a good,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.280]   that's just about the right.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.400]   It's as big as you can get without feeling kind of big.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.240]   - Right.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.720]   - And you know-- - I don't think this thing
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.440]   feels that big. - Oh, but this feels like a jewel.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.640]   - This feels like a little jewel bond that I love.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.560]   - Dwight's absolutely right.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.240]   I mean, I thought the five answers.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   - Or the five was more jewel.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.920]   - A lot of iPhone users used to put their favorite
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.880]   of steps in the dock and then their second favorite
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.160]   of steps up at the very top.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.800]   And now the strategy, I'm hearing from everyone,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   is you want your favorite stuff down at the bottom
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   because that's where your thumb is gonna hit them
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.360]   and put the less interesting stuff at the top.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.000]   Of course, you can't place things arbitrarily
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   on an iPhone home screen.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   So you got to load a bunch of junk up into the top
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.960]   in order to push your things down to the bottom.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   - Oh.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   - I know. - Oh.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.640]   - Well, you can play the chase around thing, you know,
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.760]   you can kind of chase your icons around
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.480]   and get them where you want them, but it's a real pain.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   - Take things out of a folder.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.360]   - More million phones sold on Friday last,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.160]   24 hours in pre-order.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.480]   The estimates I saw were 10 millions phones on day one
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.640]   this Friday, 10 million phones.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   Is that unprecedented?
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   - That's a lot.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.320]   - Yeah, it's a record breaker.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   Look at all these things shaking.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.160]   See them shaking?
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   - Yeah, you never use an iPhone?
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   - I don't care about these phones.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.920]   - I have to say, there are a lot of people
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   feel the same way you do.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   I mean, when you're in the Apple news cycle,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   it's all you hear about.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.400]   - Yeah.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   - It's all you hear about.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.240]   - It seems obsessive.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.280]   - It's very obsessive.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.200]   - It is obsessive.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.040]   - Yeah.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.920]   - It is the single most popular technology product.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.760]   - Is it?
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   - I think the iPhone, I think it is.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.000]   - Is that rightly so?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   - Or not rightly so.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.920]   - Obsessively so.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.480]   - Who might have judged?
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.040]   - You got to admire Apple's marketing ability.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.920]   I mean, just, you know, they're still today.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.760]   - Well, they've always been there.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.600]   - There's still lines and some applications.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.680]   - I mean, they treat those bullcrapped lines.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.520]   There's no reason for that.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.680]   - There's still lines in Apple stores.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.520]   - There's still lines.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.280]   - There were no reason for that.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.440]   That's just to get attention.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.520]   I'm surprised the media keeps playing it up.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.000]   - Well, those are real lines.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.840]   - Yeah, they're real lines.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.680]   - Yeah, they're real lines.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.520]   - No doubt about it.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.920]   They're real lines, but it's not as though Apple couldn't
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.800]   have planned and had all these phones ready to go,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.840]   shipped them overnight and had everyone have their phone.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.680]   - Well, it's true.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.040]   - They had their store on the word line.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.960]   - On Friday morning at midnight,
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.400]   I wouldn't have had to get in line at all.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.920]   I could have just ordered them.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.800]   Anyway, what about this?
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.360]   Bloomberg Business Week, Tim Cook Cover.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.600]   (laughs)
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   Andy Bio of Waxie Links says,
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.920]   "Is the ugliest cover he has ever seen?"
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.760]   He thinks Business Week is slamming Tim Cook
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   by using this, it's a free font.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   You can download on the internet.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.800]   - You can download Cook's Apple.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.640]   And it's done with--
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   - Comic Sans, too classy for this cover.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   (laughs)
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.360]   - It's pretty lame.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.280]   - That's pretty bad.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.000]   Tim Cook's Apple, so it's in this kind of school-ish script
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.560]   and they've used a inner bezel or inner glow
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.680]   and it looks radiantly blue to yellow.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.480]   Something said, this was a slam at Tim Cook.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.320]   - I'd say so.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.240]   - A back-handed slam from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.080]   - I'm in on that.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.920]   - It's a very positive cover story interview.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.720]   - Somebody didn't like them,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   they put that cover up like that.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.360]   Figuring no one's gonna read it.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.200]   - It's become a meme.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.960]   - And look at this picture of him out in front of it.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.040]   These for victory hippie sign, that's bull crap.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.200]   - People were saying after the Apple event
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.400]   that this is now Tim Cook's Apple,
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.880]   that the ghost of Steve Jobs has left the building
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.720]   and that Tim, actually it hasn't
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.960]   because Tim hasn't touched Steve Jobs' office apparently.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   It's still the same as it was.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.120]   - This is a ghost in there.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.960]   - Yeah.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.800]   - Nobody wants to go in there.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.120]   - You don't wanna let it out.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   - It's gonna haunt everybody if they let it out of there.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.560]   - I think it's without a doubt, the iPhone 6 is,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.840]   and more importantly perhaps Apple pay.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.640]   - Well, and Apple Watch.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.400]   - And the watch are Tim Cook's first products,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.640]   their first Duke product category.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.960]   - Since he took over, Tim Cook has been the MC
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   at these Apple events and yet the September 9th event,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.640]   he gave the bulk of the presentation about the Apple Watch
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.920]   and then he handed it off to Kevin Lynch for a demo,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.560]   but that's the first time he's ever done that
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.240]   with a product and that's because that's his product.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.440]   He wants to be the one to usher that into the world.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   - Is it his product or Johnny I's product?
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.880]   - Well, I mean, I would say it's the product that he was,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.560]   I mean, look, is it anybody's product,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.880]   the huge team's product, but I think that Tim Cook feels
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.440]   an attachment to this product in a way that he didn't
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.040]   to the other products that he was rolling out
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.120]   'cause they were in the pipeline
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.920]   and there were continuations of products
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.000]   that Steve Jobs had worked on.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.960]   And I think this one is much more personal to him.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.440]   - Here is Andy Bios take on Tim Cook's Apple.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.520]   He rethought some other magazine covers
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.200]   using this crap font and here's the famous
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.600]   National Geographic crap font.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.240]   Picture with the hashtag war is hell.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.560]   - So it was really an homage to the National Geographic.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.320]   - Yeah, I wonder maybe that Bloomberg thinks it's cool.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.640]   That would be sick.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.200]   - Bloomberg did release an animated GIF of it
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.160]   as part of their press release when they announced it.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.000]   So there you go.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.080]   - What did it do?
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.360]   What was the anime?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.280]   - Oh, it just the words kind of fell in
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.120]   and there were multiple--
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.960]   - Zombo dot com.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.120]   - Multiple pieces of--
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.360]   - Zombo com.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.920]   This is Johnny Ive design.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.280]   Craig Grinnell did this one for Bloomberg.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.680]   This is the link.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.520]   Here's one.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.880]   Piketty mania, why America has wealth inequality fever,
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.440]   something like one of those teenage magazines.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   Karl Marx's new crush.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.400]   Sorry, Dr. Doom.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.560]   I like these, some jabs at the design.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.080]   So Tim Cook was actually Giddy at the end of that event.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.640]   - Well, he was only Giddy 'cause he got to touch Bono.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.480]   - Let's do it.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   - It's Bono, by the way.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.160]   - Bono.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   - Oh, I thought it was Bono.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.280]   - Sunny Bono was dead.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.120]   - Shh.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.960]   - Oh.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   - That hurts.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.520]   - That was another meme of the two touching like that.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.760]   - No, I thought that was--
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.880]   - No, he was Giddy 'cause of Bono.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.720]   I'm telling you.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.560]   - Really?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.960]   - Oh, you could tell as soon as you introduce him--
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.800]   - He was shaking.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.560]   - He was actually the fanboy.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   - Yeah, he was actually--
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   - In all the photos with the after beats
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   where he was shown with all these musicians and so forth.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.880]   He just has this glow on his face
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.160]   like he just got backstage.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.520]   - I think he is a music fanboy.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.440]   - All right, okay.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.560]   - I don't think he's Giddy about the products
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.960]   he's been living with him for a lot of gunnows.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.800]   How long do you know that?
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.160]   - But he might be Giddy because he's now officially--
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.480]   - He gets to save this book by--
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.760]   - This happened before with Apple,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   if you remember when Scully took over.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.400]   And what you have to remember when Scully took over
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.040]   is that even though they've ever been blaming him
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.720]   for all sorts of things, he took the company 10X,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.920]   bigger than it was.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.640]   Went from $800 million to $8 billion a year.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.000]   And then the board was irked about one quarter or something
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.080]   and they basically roused it, if you use that word.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.280]   They roused at Scully and put in a bunch of bone he has
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.120]   in the company and started going,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.640]   "That's what's gonna happen again.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.280]   This guy will probably be able to carry the company
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.200]   for a while, he's gonna irk someone,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.960]   he's gonna get roused and that's when you sell the company."
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.320]   - John Gruber who doesn't have the greatest track record
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.360]   in the last couple of months,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.960]   but did pick the iWatch for September launch,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.600]   is now speculating that there will be three levels
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.000]   of iWatch prices.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.920]   We know 3.49 is the starting point.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.680]   He says that's the cheapest, expect to pay $1,000
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.760]   for the stainless steel model, was it four or $5,000
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.320]   for the gold watch?
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.840]   - I think he said that.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.600]   He said that and then he also said he made a bet
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   with somebody where the over under he took was $99.99.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.040]   - $10,000?
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.880]   - It's possible.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.720]   - It's solid gold.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   - If it's solid gold, it's not gonna be cheap.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.160]   - Rolex shows a solid gold watch for like 35 grand.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.440]   - Yes, but it's working with Rolex president.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.480]   - And that watch, by the way, that president,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.720]   you can hand to your grandson,
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.000]   it'll work exactly the same.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.840]   - Yeah, poor one.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.160]   - That iWatch is obsolete in one year.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.080]   - That is the biggest problem I have
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.360]   with the Superhigh price ones.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.920]   - You can melt the gold down.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.760]   - You could.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.080]   - I watch drop it in a crucible and just let it bloop down.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.600]   - Maybe if you have so much money to spend
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.440]   on the Apple Watch edition, maybe that comes,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.400]   I mean, it comes with lots of things.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   It comes with a box.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.240]   - Special box.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.080]   - A leather box.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.920]   - It's a charging box.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.760]   - With a lightning plug on the back
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.080]   that you can plug in and--
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   - Now how much would you pay?
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.480]   - And charge and I think it comes with multiple bands.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.640]   And so who's to say it doesn't come with a replacement plan
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.560]   or a swap, they could swap it out.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.920]   - It's better, five to 10 brands.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   - Or something else, because I think the obsolescence thing
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.400]   is actually the biggest argument about why you wouldn't
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.240]   want to pay for that.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.760]   - The band will slip off.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.320]   So you buy the gold watch and you can slip the band
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.160]   is gonna be the world.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.360]   - Oh, so the band's worth $5,000.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.520]   - Yeah, you pull that baby off, you get to do his version.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.560]   - 18 carat rose gold.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.880]   - Yeah, they say that they're metal
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.320]   or just to solve many problems involving gold.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.360]   And I thought that was the most,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.880]   I talked to a guy who works with metal or just afterward
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.760]   and he was like, well, you know,
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.080]   this is what happens in this industry,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.200]   but I just thought that was the most Apple statement ever
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.800]   which is like after thousands of years,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.640]   we have fixed gold.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.040]   - Fixed gold.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.640]   - We've solved the problems.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.480]   - Wow.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.440]   - We consulted actual horologists.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   - Yes, horologists and metal or just involved.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.840]   - Unbelievable.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.880]   It's almost starting to feel like a parody of itself.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.960]   - I don't know.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.520]   And yet when we were talking about this the last time
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.360]   I was up here that there are these companies that will,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.560]   all of the parts leaks come from these companies
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.320]   that are, they replace the back plate with gold
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.400]   and they were or wood or something like that.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.160]   And I do think Apple looks at that and says,
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   well, why don't we eliminate the middleman?
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.480]   Why don't we just make a gold, whatever.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.880]   I mean, the next step, will they make a gold iPhone
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.680]   at some point and eliminate those guys too?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.880]   I don't know, but they risk people really rejecting them
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.360]   as being some, you know, just for the super rich.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.200]   If they do that.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.280]   - I feel like a $5,000 watch would--
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.880]   - Nobody's gonna buy it.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.800]   - I can't, man.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.640]   - Nobody's kidding?
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.000]   - Nobody's gonna buy the $5,000 watch.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.320]   They're all gonna buy the--
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.440]   - No, they're gonna sell a lot of those watches.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.240]   - Just like people buy $5,000 watches now,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.360]   they'll buy a $5,000 Apple watch.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.200]   - I think they're gonna sell.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.040]   - They won't sell.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   - They won't sell.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.720]   - Many of them, as the three of them--
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.560]   - It's gonna be a lot of money.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.920]   - It's a $9 watch, but they will sell a lot of them.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.120]   - Every CEO in Silicon Valley will probably buy them.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.960]   - Right.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   - I gotcha.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.640]   - So it may get very different.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.480]   - They're very different.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.520]   - To match their Tesla.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.600]   - Focus, then I think--
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.000]   - Although on one level, it doesn't sound any different
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.720]   from the Apple that made the iPod high-fi
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.680]   'cause they were mad that Bose was making all the money
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.480]   from off the sound dock.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   - Right.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.520]   - Or the reason that Apple sells cases now
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   is because it used to be, they sold other people's cases
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.000]   when they sold an iPhone and now they sell their own
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.280]   and they get to make that money too.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.200]   And it's a little like that.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   Like, look, we're gonna make this awesome thing.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.240]   Why would we not make a super expensive version
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   and take all that money out of the table?
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.960]   - The Apple store I went to had no third party cases,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.480]   lots of Apple cases.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   I then went to an AT&C store, lots of third party cases,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.200]   went to a Verizon store,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.720]   it wasn't that they couldn't get third party cases,
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.120]   they chose not to sell on it.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.600]   And they have leather, I hear the leather's nice,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.240]   I haven't seen it, they didn't have it at the store.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.080]   - Oh, is that the leather?
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.920]   - That's the leather.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.000]   - Oh, it didn't know.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.160]   - Yeah, I got a $20 Griffin reveal case
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.240]   that's best buy, great case,
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.720]   it's the same one I put my iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 in,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.280]   $20, works great.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.840]   - Yeah, how much is Apple charging for the leather?
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.680]   It's like 60 bucks.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.520]   - It's like 49?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.720]   - 49, 50, 49, yeah.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.760]   - What do you think, John?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   You're our leather expert.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.440]   - Many Apple cases never gonna be the best deal,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.840]   but they'll sell a lot of them.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.080]   - He's solved the problems with leather, yeah.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.920]   (laughing)
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.960]   - Yeah, my medal just did it.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.440]   - Interesting, interesting angle.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.560]   - John's been a horologist for years.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   - Yeah, I have been a horologist.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.360]   - So let's take a break when we come back, we'll talk some.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.560]   I wanna actually ask about the warranty canary,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.400]   not warranty canary.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.160]   - Oh yeah, that's actually a good story.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.600]   - Let's talk about that, all right.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.720]   Coming up, but first a word from our friends

[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.640]   We use it for our insight, TWIT, you cannot bring,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.000]   you use it for no agenda show.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.760]   No agenda uses it, you should have them
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.920]   try to bring down the site.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.760]   You've done this every time.

[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.840]   but we're gonna keep trying.

[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.120]   will Adam Curry pop up in front of me?
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.760]   I was gonna bring him to the studio.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.120]   I was gonna bring him down.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.960]   Should've.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.800]   And put him in the audience.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.160]   Oh my God, that would've been fun.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.000]   Is he there now?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.840]   Is that you Adam?
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.680]   He might be.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.520]   No.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.840]   All right, squarespace.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.400]   To get 10% off and don't forget to tweet,

[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.240]   That, you see there, those are the rules.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.360]   (laughs)
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   Ah, yeah.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   I'm glad you put them on the screen
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.200]   so we can quickly scan them.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.360]   Yep, yep, the rules are gonna be,
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   where are those rules, Chad?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.000]   Podtrack.com/rules-twit.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.280]   Podtrack.com/rules-twit.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.840]   Player.podtrack.com.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.680]   Oh my God.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.400]   I believe that if you go to the inside-twit blog,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   you don't need to know the rules.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.800]   Find a link there.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   You don't need the rules.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.640]   What do you need the rules for?
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.480]   It's the worst that can happen.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.200]   If you break the rules, what's gonna happen?
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.240]   Yeah, nothing.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.480]   Nothing.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.240]   I think it's limited to...
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.600]   Humans.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.680]   Wherever it's legal, humans in the United States,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.520]   wherever it's legal.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.120]   There's probably some state that's invalid.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.320]   Oh, I'm sure there is.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.360]   So I'm only legal where valid.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.200]   By law.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.040]   By law.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.880]   Yes.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880]   Yes, sir, you were going where?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.480]   I went over to this Petaluma market.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.840]   You know, I go there once in a while.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.120]   That is the grumpiest bunch of cashiers.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.200]   Have you ever been there?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.360]   I go there every day.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.960]   And you know, we were just thinking about this.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.400]   There's no turnover at that place.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.560]   Those people have been there for years.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.800]   That's probably why they're so grumpy.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.320]   I'd be grumpy if I'd been here for years.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   They don't smile.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.480]   They just growl.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.320]   Oh, it's horrible.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.920]   And then even the zombie-like baggers,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.760]   there's just a...
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.160]   Anyway, if you're coming in to check out the show,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   which a lot of people like to do,
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.920]   go over to the Petaluma markets right across the street.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.840]   And meet the zombie-baggers.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.320]   And tell me I'm not right.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.280]   Oh, they're great people.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.640]   I think they just, it's you, John.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.480]   No.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.160]   They're zombies.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.000]   It's horrible.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.280]   So what is it called?
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.680]   A warrant canary?
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.520]   Is that what we call them?
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520]   No, what was it called?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.840]   Was it?
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.920]   Yeah, a warrant canary.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.640]   A warrant canary apples.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.320]   Patriot Act.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.240]   Detecting warrant canary is dead.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.960]   Yeah, I mean, something happened.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.800]   Something happened.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   They do a transparency report, as everybody does now.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.160]   It was right after Tim Cook was on Charlie Rose.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   Did you see the interview?
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.240]   Yeah, I did.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.640]   And he says, "Well, it'd be over our dead body
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400]   before we cooperate with the government."
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.680]   You see, that's interesting.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.400]   So they have to take us out in a box.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.760]   It's, well, you know, I've been telling Tim,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.120]   and I thank God he listens to me,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.720]   for years, that the Apple's best market position
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.800]   is to say we're the privacy company.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.120]   We don't have to make money on your information.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.440]   We make money on our hardware.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.280]   It's what he says.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.120]   You can trust us.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.440]   And now he's, well, they've just now started
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.880]   to really pursue that as a marketing angle.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.720]   And then they can--
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   I think it's going to go for that.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   --all of that.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   So that tells you something.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.680]   The change in iOS 8, where they're not holding the keys
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.200]   anymore.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:12.700]   So they--
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.200]   Perfect example.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.720]   Because if they were holding a copy of your keys,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.080]   they could give those to the government
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:17.440]   unencrypted--
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.760]   Well, and there's a long queue of law enforcement officials
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.280]   asking for decryption of iPhones.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.920]   There's a whole process you would send an iPhone to Apple.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.760]   It was a several month wait, because it took a while to do it.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.480]   But they would crack the iPhone and send you the contents.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.360]   That Apple now, as proud to say, is no longer possible.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.600]   We no longer can do that.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.920]   We've made these secure.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.840]   And I think that's smart of them.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.320]   And by the way, it's very clear that the jab is
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.120]   at Facebook and Google.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.760]   He told Charlie Rose, we don't have to sell your information.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.520]   We don't sell advertising.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.360]   Of course they do.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.000]   But--
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.160]   Right.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.800]   There's even a little subset about I had
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.080]   and how it's walled off from a lot of these things.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.600]   I think it's fairly true.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   I think this is a differentiator for Apple.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.640]   It's a good marketing position.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.160]   So one of the things Apple did in their transparency report
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:12.320]   last year is they put a line in that said, we have never--
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.120]   we have never received a Section 215 request.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.720]   That's the secret request from--
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.240]   authorized by the Patriot Act for information that
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.560]   comes with a gag order.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.400]   That's specific to business information 215.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.240]   It says, we're going to ask you for information.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.160]   You must give us that information.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.440]   And you may not tell anyone.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.600]   Apple only-- That's only-- comes with the National Security
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:34.920]   Letter.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.420]   Right.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.480]   It's in NSL.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.440]   Apple put in their transparency report
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.360]   covering January 1st through 30th of 2014.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.520]   We've never received one.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.240]   And we at the time said, that looks like a warranty canary.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.520]   You don't say we've never received one
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   unless you expect to receive one at some point.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.320]   And what you'll do is you'll take that out,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.720]   because obviously you now cannot say it anymore.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   So yep, it's happened.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.240]   There is no warranty canary anymore
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.600]   in their transparency report.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.320]   So apparently they have-- I don't know what that means.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.920]   Big deal.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.040]   Well, it means something.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.000]   They've received--
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.120]   They've been-- the government's on their case
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.480]   to get all your information.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   They've received a request.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.840]   Fascinating to see that Yahoo was threatened
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.280]   with a quarter of a million-day fine for not cooperating
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.720]   with the government a couple of years ago.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.640]   That's coming out now.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.480]   It's kind of an expensive fine.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.120]   Quarter of a million dollars a day.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.040]   Yeah, it's high.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.920]   Over a refusal to give the data to the NSA,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.280]   or should it refuse, I think one can assume that Yahoo did.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.520]   The company released 1,500 documents
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   from a failed suit against the NSA over user data requests
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.680]   and cooperation with PRISM compliance
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.840]   in those documents, the information
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.040]   that they had been threatened with a quarter million dollar
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.000]   a day fine.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.640]   Of course, the threat is one thing.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.480]   So, Leo, do you think that if the feds came to Apple
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.120]   with a phone and said, here, we want this decrypted,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.840]   and Apple said to the feds, we don't have the keys.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.800]   We can't do it.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.840]   Do you think the feds would just walk away and say,
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.680]   OK, you can't do it?
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.040]   They'd want to make sure that they couldn't.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.640]   But I think that that's the point that Apple doesn't want
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.560]   to be put in that position anymore.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   Right.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.040]   At that point, it's up to the NSA
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.760]   to break the encryption, which they--
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.320]   They may well be.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.000]   --or find a bug that reveals this information.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So you can bet--
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Just take Apple out of it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.440]   --or waltzes through the back door.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.280]   Right.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.240]   We actually have in our audience a guy who works
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   in counterterrorism for the FBI.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   And--
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.960]   No, his name is Adam Curry.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.160]   No, what?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.880]   Where I just started reading the chat room, I got it.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.440]   Don't read the chat.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.120]   I highly amused by something someone said.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.440]   But, you know, and when I mean somebody like that,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.720]   I thanked him because I'm very grateful to the federal officials
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   who are doing their best to keep groups like ISIS
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   out of the United States.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.200]   Oh, my god, they'll be here any minute.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.560]   Those guys are scary.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.720]   Oh, please.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.280]   You don't think they're coming for us?
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Oh, brother.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.960]   What are you-- what have you been reading the wrong papers?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Well, they threatened me.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.560]   Are you just shaking in your boots
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.080]   because the ISIS people are going to be
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.360]   waltzing down the main street and peddle them off my head?
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.040]   They threatened me.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:10.840]   Those head chucks.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.720]   Twitter employees.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.960]   We're not only fake, but we finally got to the Turkish sitcom--
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.480]   and that was in the sitcom was a drama--
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.760]   where the exact same scenario took place.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.400]   And we think it's the exact same.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.680]   The whole thing was from this Turkish--
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.080]   I didn't watch it, so I don't know.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.200]   Of course you did.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.080]   Did it look real?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.760]   No.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.160]   Oh.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.000]   Was it real?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.160]   Where's our FBI guy?
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.680]   He's hiding.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   Oh, are we not going to see him?
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   I wouldn't have to admit it.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.520]   I wouldn't admit it.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.480]   All right, but I guess that's my point.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.040]   Is there's a tension between, on the one hand,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.160]   we want our own privacy.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.640]   We don't-- as US citizens, we don't want to be spied upon.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.960]   But on the other hand, we damn well want to be protected.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   I know you don't believe we're at any risk.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.840]   I don't believe we're at any risk.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.320]   I didn't want to put those words in your mouth.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:54.880]   You did.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.760]   I don't mind people writing for it.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.840]   Are we at risk?
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.720]   We're not.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   What do you mean?
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.040]   Is it theater?
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.880]   OK, just a question.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   All right.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.400]   One of these guys, they haven't got an Air Force.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.720]   They haven't got a Navy.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.080]   They've got a bunch of Toyota Airlines.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.280]   They've got a bunch of Toyota trucks.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.880]   All United Airlines is going to land over here in Petalume.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.720]   Most people that have a clue they would like to see these guys
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.320]   or hear so they can kill them.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.000]   That's true.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.280]   If we knew where they were.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.440]   All right.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.880]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.520]   And you should be.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:30.360]   It's like this every-- you keep inviting them back.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.080]   So you know you're asking for it.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.440]   Because you know how to work with me.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.000]   We work well together.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.720]   It's like a team.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   Leo's.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.600]   I was going to mention--
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.120]   I was going to mention Rick Perry, but I won't.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.640]   Rick?
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.560]   How's he doing?
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   How's that lawsuit doing?
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.840]   There are prosecutions of a prosecutor.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.920]   How's Texas doing?
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.080]   Oh, that thing was a fake.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.320]   Well, he's-- you know what he did, what he's accused of doing
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.160]   is telling this prosecutor in Austin
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.200]   that if she didn't resign, he was going to veto the appropriation
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.520]   for the office that was investigating some of the--
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.360]   I'll just defund--
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.680]   I'll just defund the office.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.800]   The office didn't have to worry about it.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   The defense he's taking is that he has the right to veto
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.520]   because he's the governor.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.640]   The prosecutor says yes, but when combined with the threat,
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.000]   it becomes something else.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.960]   And so that's-- it's all right now.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.920]   It's all just posturing.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.080]   It feels like a lot of politics, frankly.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.760]   It is a lot of politics.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.840]   But if he threatened somebody with a veto
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.000]   and his own friends, the appointees,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.120]   were being investigated by this group,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.880]   there's probably enough smoke there for an indictment.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.800]   At least that's what the prosecutor thinks,
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.000]   a special prosecutor thinks.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.080]   The other thing-- but the reason I brought up Rick Perry
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.760]   is Rick Perry has implied that ISIS is coming
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.280]   across the Texas border.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.680]   And there's even a sheriff in West Texas
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   who says that they found Muslim clothing and carans
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   in the desert where they--
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.560]   Why would they be leaving the carans behind?
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.040]   That's some sort of violation.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.160]   Yes, or they're clothing.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.920]   So the best tweet that I saw about this--
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.080]   So we have a bunch of naked Muslims
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.440]   roaming around South Texas.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.680]   Corranless Muslims.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.200]   I'm scared.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.840]   I'm looking for reading material.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.280]   I just wanted to give people a break from the iPhone.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   I don't know which one is more than the chat room
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:24.800]   suggest.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.040]   I'm talking about the Niners.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.200]   This is much less awkward this way.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.040]   Like this versus iPhone.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.080]   Moving along, actually interesting story
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.920]   coming out of a company that specializes in tear downs
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.680]   and understanding how the processors work in these things.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.800]   Chipworks is their name.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.720]   They've taken a look at the AA processor in the new iPhones.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.680]   And they say this is not a Samsung part.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.920]   iPhones have had Samsung parts in them since day one.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.560]   Or Samsung was--
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.120]   Yeah, they were--
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.880]   Chipworks says the AA processor was fabbed at TSMC.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.840]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.360]   It has 2 billion transistors in it.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.400]   Well, yeah, this is a smaller process than the A7.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's a 20 nanometer.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.920]   20 nanometer process.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.240]   And it's 89 square millimeters with 2 billion transistors.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.480]   That just-- that actually was more interested than anything
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   else.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.720]   That just blows my mind.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.160]   But obviously, Apple would like to have at least a second
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.440]   source for chips if not get out of Samsung's pockets entirely.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   Samsung's a big company.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.160]   The fact that they make cell phones to compete with iPhones
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.080]   in one division.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.280]   And the chip processor in another, that doesn't mean much.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.000]   It does.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.560]   Does it?
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.200]   Don't you think?
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   You don't want to give your vendor--
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.680]   you're competing with, making your chip?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.840]   Do you think they'll put a bug in it?
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.080]   I never thought of that, but that's not a bad idea.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.160]   Apple hates being reliant on anybody.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.000]   And even so much.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.200]   Especially a competitor.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.240]   So having other--
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.560]   But Apple doesn't own fabs.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.080]   Right.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.280]   Right.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.840]   They don't own-- there are lots of different parts
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.440]   that they don't own.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   But I'm sure that they're also talking to Intel,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.040]   because Intel's now said that they're
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.200]   willing to make other chips.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.240]   Yeah, arm chips.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.400]   They're willing to make arm chips.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.160]   Well, they got those big-- they got huge fabs.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.880]   Huge fabs, right.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.200]   And then--
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.240]   Would Apple build-- so a fab is the plant in which you--
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:08.720]   Right, right.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.400]   Apple doesn't use the factories that make the chips.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.080]   They design the chips, but they don't own the factories
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:13.800]   where they make them.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600]   They contract with somebody.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.440]   They're very expensive to build.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.520]   They're billion dollar factories.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   Right.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   And Apple is--
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.040]   Five billion?
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.920]   This is why all those assembly plants in Asia,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.640]   mostly in China that Apple uses, those aren't owned by Apple.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.280]   Either Apple owns some factories,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.400]   but others, they just rent out, essentially.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.800]   Obviously, Apple would like to own every--
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.080]   from beginning to end.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   Remember, they want to control it.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.360]   They want to control it.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.200]   I think they'd like to own it.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.720]   I remember Henry Ford, the big plant he built in Dearborn,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.520]   the box cars would come in with a Rouge factory.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.400]   The box cars would come in with wood and iron ore,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.120]   and that would come in Model T.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.240]   That makes sense, you know.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.280]   Very similar to Foxconn, by the way.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   Iron ore would come in.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.440]   They have their own smelter steel.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.960]   They're out the end comes-- there's an iPhone comes out of it.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.760]   I think that that's how Apple thinks.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.280]   It's funny.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.880]   I mean, the Sapphire plant is apparently an out of it.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.720]   They owned--
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Deal, but not the--
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.880]   Were you surprised that there was no Sapphire
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.280]   on the face of this phone?
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   Or is that?
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   Now that we know-- well, there is the touch ideas Sapphire
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   and the camera on the back.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   But that's always in.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   And the camera's always in.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   Not when we heard that the Apple Watch,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   two of the three models are going to be Sapphire screens.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   So what was everyone make such a big deal about the Sapphire?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   Why?
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   Because on your show, everyone-- oh, the Sapphire's going to be Sapphire.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   Well, people are excited.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280]   It's new material.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   It's new, and everybody's tired of their phones cracking.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   Mark was cracking and stepped on it.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   Yeah, and then they didn't use it.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   They didn't use it.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   And then you had a piece and you busted it and cut yourself.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   Well, apparently it wasn't Sapphire.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   So Apple's using Gorilla Glass, you think still?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   So what it sounds like when you tap it?
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   It sounds like if it's not Gorilla Glass, it's like Gorilla Glass.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   It's got a certain--
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   I'm not sure Corning has said whether this is Gorilla Glass.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   They never did.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   In fact, it was-- I didn't know this until I read the Walter
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   Isaacson biography, but Corning had shut down the Gorilla Glass
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   factories.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280]   There was no market for it.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   Steve Jobs came to them and said, I've got this thing I'm making
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   and I would really like some very hard glass for it.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   So it was really Apple that made Gorilla Glass happen.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   And what were a third version, which I think is a pretty strong
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   glass, what do they call this ionics change?
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   Ion, some ionics change, yeah.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   It must be good.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   It's not unbridible, but it's way less scratchable and breakable
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.280]   than the Gorilla Glass.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   But it's not Gorilla Glass?
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   Is it or is it not Gorilla Glass?
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   We don't know, because Apple doesn't sound like it.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   It sounds like when you tap on it.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.280]   What does that sound?
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   It has that plasticy sound.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   Gorilla Glass sounds like plastic when you're right.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   It doesn't sound like glass.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   So did you all see the video of the drop test of both of these
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   phones?
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   You mean the kid in Sydney, Australia got the first iPhone
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   was so excited.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   No, no, no, not the first one.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   He broke it.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   It was a drop test.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   That's an Australian for you.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   He dropped it.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   I don't think it broke.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   No, this was a different thing.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.280]   There's a blog that goes out and gets some of the first
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   iPhones in Australia and they always drop them as a drop test.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   I hate that.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   Well, except when they dropped it, yes, it broke, but it was
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   the way it broke that was interesting.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   The glass part separated from the case.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   It cracked, but it looked almost like something popped up
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   from within, like the way a battery would have a battery
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   expand.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   Like a delaminated or something?
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   So it broke differently than past iPhones, which I found.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   That's why I immediately went out to the case.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   Is that their new model?
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   Break differently?
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   Yeah, break.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   That's a good one.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   But if you haven't seen that, look for that video.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   It's really all the way it breaks.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.280]   I know people with a broken glass, fours and fives.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   Oh, God.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   Everybody who's had an iPhone has a broken.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   And so you can get them, I tell people this is a tip for
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   everybody who has one of these old phones.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   If it's broken and you want to get it, you can take it in.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   Just like it, right?
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   You can try, if you want to bleed, you can take it in to get it
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   replaced and they'll tell you no, they usually won't tell you,
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   but if you go in with Band-aids on as though you've been
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   cutting yourself on the glass, they immediately see it as a
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   liability issue and they give you a brand new phone on the spot.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   I know two guys have done this.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   Okay, kids.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   So Band-aids, if you want to really get cool out, it puts you
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   like, have blood, you know.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   Or your tongue.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   Also a limp.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   Have a limp and like a slit for your arm and just go all the way.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   My iPhone killed me.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   Do, do, do.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   Let's see, iOS, Apple confirms that the NFC chip in this
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   does nothing, so that's nice.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   Well, it's an only old word for Apple Pay and Apple Pay is not
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   available until October.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.280]   Well, for now, but so you've got an NFC chip.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   You're all in on Apple Pay, I bet you.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   Me?
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   Well, no.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   I like the, look, okay, I love the idea of not carrying a wallet.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   Just like the Queen England.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   I want to be like the Queen.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   But I don't think that just because Apple does it, it's going to
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   suddenly emerge into the world fully formed.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   We've been trying to do this for years.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   I think that's the wrong, I think that's the wrong word, though.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   I think one of the reasons Apple's doing it now is because it
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   thinks that this is a good time because they're also replacing
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   normal swipes with chip and pin in the US.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   That's true.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   By the end of next year, everything has to be chip and pin.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   And so this stuff is going to turn over and it's going to have
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   NFC built into it and it's going to have this built into it.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   And Apple--
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   Your timing is right because they have to buy new terminals
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   for chip and pin.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   Right, and they've gotten us clout too that as a very large
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   maker that can control the hardware.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   I buy that.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   I think it's timing more than it's like Apple's making it happen.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   It makes sense.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   Apple's helping it happen maybe, but it's also good timing.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   So if I'm a merchant, I know I'm going to have to get a new
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   terminal for chip and pin by the end of this next coming year.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   And it'll have an NFC.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   And I'm for sure going to make sure that it supports every
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   form of tap and pay I can get, which means Google Wallet,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   Apple Pay, whatever else there is.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   Exactly.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   Walmart and CVS have already said we're going to buy new
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   terminals, but it isn't going to have Apple pay.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   It's not good, but I think that's because they've already
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   done a deal with somebody else.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.280]   Probably so.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   But they're early on it.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   I think they're playing--
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   They're all agents.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.280]   These other guys have had this--
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   It's not until the end of 2015.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   Years and years NFC's been on these other ones.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.280]   But you see what Jason's saying is because chip and pin is
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.280]   coming, everybody has to buy new terminals.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   No, I am agreeing with this basic thesis.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   Just not early.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   And Google had a hard time because Google doesn't control
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   their hardware partners and not all the phones that had the
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   NFC.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   And I think Apple will push it along a little bit.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   And everybody who's got one of those NFC Android phones will
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   benefit too.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   So prediction, by the end of 2015, will we all be tapping and
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   paying whether it's with our Apple Watch, Apple Phone or
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   Google Phone?
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   No.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   I think it's going to be more of a convenience because they're
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   going to be places that don't take it, right?
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   I mean, it's just like now they're places that only take
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   cash and maybe now they're starting to have square.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   So you still have to carry your wallet.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   I think at some point it developed the bump and steal.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   But if I'm going--
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   When you've got the phone on somebody bumps you and they
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   boom, next thing you know, they've got--
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   Yeah, but you can't do that because you're not supposed to
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.280]   touch ID and stuff.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   That's going to be crap.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   But when I run to Whole Foods to buy some beer and peanut butter
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   or whatever, I might just take my phone for that because I know
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   I can pay that.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   So they said they're going to do it.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.280]   And if I forget my wallet and I have my phone, I'll actually
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   be able to buy something, which is nice, other than like
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   scanning my card at Starbucks or something.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   Well, and I have to say already, just purely psychological,
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   I'm sure, John, you're right that it's probably not
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   super secure.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   But already just the notion that I can touch my finger to this
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.280]   and my bank, for instance, is using it to unlock the banking
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:14.280]   app.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   It makes me feel better, last pass is using.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   It makes me feel better.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   I feel like that's better than a pin.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   Harder to-- right?
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   It's harder to produce.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   Yeah, well, and what you can do is then make your password
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.280]   something more complicated because you have to enter it a lot
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   less frequently.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   So like I used to have a four-digit code on my phone and now
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   I have a complex password because I only enter it when I reboot
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   and otherwise I just use my phone.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   So this is a good thing, I think.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.280]   Well, we'll see what we--
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   All right, enough Apple talk, we're going to take a break,
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   come back and talk about Kindle.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   There's a new one.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   Nice.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   I heard that.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   I haven't gotten it.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   I ordered immediately.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   Well, I think it comes out--
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   A month.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   A month.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   What's-- okay, you're going to tell us why it's special then.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   Yes.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   And a new Kids Edition that I have a unique warranty,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   but first a word.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   I'm doing it again, I'm teasing.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   Yeah, as this for your word--
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   As if people can't just fast forward.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   You couldn't just skip this ad and go right to the most
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.280]   interesting thing.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   You better just slipstream the ads a little smoother.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   This is why you need to watch live.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   Or--
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   Because you can't--
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   Yeah, but it's only the X number of people.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   Maybe if I teased really boring stuff.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   No, no, no.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   Because then people say, "Well, I don't want to get there,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   so I'll listen to the ad."
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   Oh, good idea.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.280]   No, you should grab--
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   Coming up, we'll show you how to make chopped liver
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   and onions with your iPhone.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   That's next.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   No, no, you should--
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   You should also--
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.280]   No, you should--
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   What is this ad?
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   You should just go--
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   Oh, here's an interesting story.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.280]   Citrix, go to me.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   Oh, that's--
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   I don't want to fool people.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   That's called native advertising.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   That's native, baby.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   That's native, baby.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   Do you?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   I think so, yeah.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   Now you're talking.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   Hey, did you hear this about Go to Meeting?
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   It's the proven solution for meeting and collaborating
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   with your team online from anywhere.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   Really?
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Tell me more.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   Tell me more.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   Tell me more.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   You know what I've always felt?
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   Good communication is crucial in business.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   Don't you feel bad?
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   I've always thought that.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   Especially when the people you work with aren't in the same
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   office.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   Yeah, what do you do when they're not in the same office?
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.280]   Miscommunication can happen.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   Oh, yeah, it can.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   And there could be misunderstandings.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   In fact, I find when people are in different offices,
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   sometimes they hate each other because they don't understand
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   each other.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   That's where Go to Meeting is bridging the gap.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   Bringing people to get--
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   Oh, I'm going on.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   It's all yours now.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   I dropped the script.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   Bringing people together, you're going to let me take this.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   Actually, millions of people rely on Citrix Go to Meeting.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   It's probably the number one way to meet online.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   It is great.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   Not only-- they've always had screen sharing, so you're on
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   the same-- literally on the same page when you're reviewing
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   documents or presentations.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   But they now have HD video conferencing, so it is a full
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   video conference.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   I feel so sorry for the people.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   And I know lots of them who spent $50,000, $100,000 on big
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   conference rooms with video conferencing.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   Yeah, no, I've seen--
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   I know that commercial Cisco systems.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   And they're not even as good as Go to Meeting.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   It's like, God, I feel bad for them.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   It's expensive.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   It's really expensive.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   Go to Meeting is so affordable.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   You pay once a month.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   I think it's $49 for as many meetings as you want, as often
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   as you want.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   You present.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   You demonstrate.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280]   You meet.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   It's so inexpensive.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   They don't time you.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.280]   So I know plenty of remote offices that just keep it running
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.280]   all the time.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   And they're like working together.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.280]   It's really great.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   You'll see why millions choose Go to Meeting when you start
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   hosting your own face-to-face meetings online today for free,
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   for 30 days.

[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.280]   The promo code is "Twit."
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   And we thank Citrix for their support of this week in tech.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Amazon has announced-- by the way, we should point out that Amazon
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.280]   dropped the price on the fire phone to basically $0.99 plus you
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   get a year of prime and they still can't sell it.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.280]   And I have one in the drawer.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   And if any-- you want a fire phone?
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   Yeah, I'll take it.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.280]   All right, I'll give it to you.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   99 cents.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   I got a dollar.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   You know what?
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   I'll give you a keep it penny.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   I'll give you a dollar to take it.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.280]   Okay.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   Thank you.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   You make it better every minute.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   I'll take it, but you gotta pay me $2.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   It's so sad because all Amazon is going to do is just make it a
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   regular Android phone.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   It's kind of regular, isn't it?
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   No.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280]   It's very similar to Android.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   No.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   It's like going off the deep end.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   It's got the weird--
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   It's got the kindle thing.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.280]   It is.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   It's the same OS.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   And there's no Google Store.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   There's their Amazon Store.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   So Leo, I'm going to be a contrarian here.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   I like the fire phone.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.280]   Really?
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   Yes.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   I like the fire phone.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   Let me go get mine.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   You tell us about it.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   I have a fire TV.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   I have the fire TV.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   I never hooked it up.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   The fire TV is actually--
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280]   Keep talking about it.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   He goes and gets it.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   Amazon is doing something different.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   They're building from scratch what amounts to an ecosystem.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   Similar to what Android and Apple have.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   And if you are an Amazon customer and use their products a lot,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   it's a great way to have a phone.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   It's a great way to watch their streaming video.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   And actually, on the fire TV, if you've never hooked it up,
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   you should because the picture on it is excellent.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   Well, it comes off the fire TV.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   It comes off the phone.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   No.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   Well, you can do that.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   You can stream from the fire--
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   You can stream from the TV.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   The phone.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   Yes.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   But also, the fire TV connects to Amazon Prime.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   It also has a Netflix app.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.280]   But the picture on it is when your connection is good is better,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   I think, than the picture on the Apple TV and certainly on what
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   I've seen on even the highest end Roku.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   It's a really good streaming box.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   And Amazon-- you know, this is version 1.0 for both for Amazon.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   And I would not discount them at all because as we've seen with
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   the release these new Kindle, they keep coming back and coming
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   back and get it right.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   What Roku box are you using?
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   The three.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   Huh.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   And you think there's a better image?
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   Yes, it has a much better--
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   And it has the same bit rate?
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   Have you checked-- have you watched the bit rate?
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   Because you can turn on that little feature,
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   it shows you all that.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   You can't in the fire TV, but you can on the Roku.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   I just-- it just looks better to me.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   It looks much more-- it looks much more--
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   What do they sell for?
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   Because I've never thought of--
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   99.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   Now they have the same--
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   Do they have the same fundamental linkage like to Netflix
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.280]   and all the rest?
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   Yes.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   Oh.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   I don't know how that misses.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   I can't hear the firefly is going to be available in the Amazon
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   app going forward.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   So that's the firefly.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.280]   It's not actually--
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   It's nice.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280]   And it's about the same size.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   It's a 4.7 inch screen.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   Same size with the iPhone.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.280]   It's not quite as weird.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   If it had people hand--
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.280]   But people hand--
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   I would say all of that was--
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   No, what is this issue, Guy?
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   What is this other thing?
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   Well, okay.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   So this is my simulation of what they knew--
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   They're doing a Kindle for kids.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.280]   Oh, I thought that was the next generation iPhone.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   It's a little big, but you can use it as a purse.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   Bigger screens.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   That's why they want Apple Pay, so you just use it as your purse.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   So I was writing about these new kindles,
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   and somebody pointed out to me that they actually changed
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   the branding, and only the e-reader is now called Kindle.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   All the rest of them are just called Fire.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   Oh, there's no Kindle Fire.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   It's just Fire.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   It's Fire HD.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   Interesting.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   So this is the new rubber-encased fire.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   Now, what I love about this is there's two--
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   First of all, it's 149 bucks.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   Six or seven inch Amazon tablet.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Free unlimited all.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   You can eat kids' content.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   And a two-year guarantee that means they'll replace it
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   even if the kid breaks it.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   I believe so.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   That's a pretty big selling point for any parent who's kids.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   Now, it is a case in rubber like this.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   Yeah, it's a match.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   It's ruggedized.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   I can see a kid breaking it.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   It's like what they use for people up on the top of telephone poles.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   It's like it needs to be that.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   That rug.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   But still, there's always a glass front that could be broken
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   with a determined child.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   That's what kids are for.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   So, you know, that got my attention.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   I thought-- I mean, I don't have--
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   I mean, I don't have-- my kids are 20 and 19.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   Yeah, I just--
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   I expect them to trust them.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   Want this.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   Yeah, probably not.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   I feel like this is something-- if you had a 2D role,
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   you'd be very excited about, right?
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   Two parents and four kids.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   There's a family library feature that means two parents and four kids
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   can share movies, books.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   This is kind of what Apple has done with their family sharing.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   But, you know, they've got all their content deals.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   And, I mean, it's smart.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   This is one of the things I like about Amazon and these products
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   is they're-- they're defiantly Amazon products, right?
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   They're not Android devices, even though Android is powering them.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   And they're using their ecosystem and their library of content
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   that they've got to power this stuff.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   And it's a really interesting idea.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   And for two years--
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   And then there's a $99 tablet, too.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   I mean, that doesn't look like a cheap tablet.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   It's actually a decent--
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   I'm impressed.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   I'm actually very impressed.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   I just want-- I was going to give this to John and see if you could break it.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   I can break it.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   No, you do not.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   Never mind.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   And they announced new readers, which are Kindles.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   Yeah, that's the new reader is--
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.280]   I'm--
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   I bought it immediately.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   I did, too.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   One is very expensive.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   Well, it's $200.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280]   It's $200.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   It's reasonable.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   The voyage.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   The voyage.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   I think Amazon realized that there are people who love these e-ink readers,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   and I'm one of them.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.280]   I saw a tweet that said, "Oh, new Kindle."
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   And I was like, "All right, order."
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.280]   Just-- because I love them for reading books.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.280]   And this one is 300 DPI screens.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   So it's--
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   It's 300 DPI.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   Now we're talking about what the latest--
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   Our buddy, Andy Inaco, went to the launch event in New York,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   and he said-- he did a double take, because it's one thing to see a backlit screen
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   that's at this retina quality where you can't see the pixels,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   but to see a reflective screen like an e-ink screen at 300 DPI,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   he said his brain kind of couldn't wrap itself around what he was seeing.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   It's essentially the same as a paper.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   It looks like you're looking at paper, except then you tap it.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   And now it doesn't have a button.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   It's got a pressure-sensitive haptic--
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.280]   It's a button that doesn't move is what it is.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   So you can turn the page just by pressing the sides,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   which is--
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   How is that different than the Kindle Paperwhite?
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   Paperwhite thing.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   No, paperweight, you got to tap the screen, which is the thing I liked at least about the paperwhite.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   Well, what are you saying?
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   Now, you touch the bezel.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   You push it on the bezel.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   The-- it's not white and black, though.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   I mean, it's not-- black text on white.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   It's dark gray text on a off-white background,
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   although they keep improving that over time.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   It's still higher contrast than before.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   Now, 199 means you're with special offers.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   You're going to get ads.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   If you want it without special offers, add 20 bucks.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   And if you want free 3G, the whispers sync over 3G,
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   which I think is great.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   You're at an airport or you're driving around and you want to get a book,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   you can do that.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   That's another 50 bucks.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   But yeah, and I think this is a pretty compelling product.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   You know it is the highest, most expensive E-ink Amazon Kindle in a long time.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   There's an audience for it.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.280]   Yeah, and they're still selling the cheaper E-ink Kindles.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   In fact, there's one below the paperwhite now.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   It doesn't light itself, but it's sort of based on the paperwhite.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   79 bucks.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   And it's got a touchscreen.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   But, you know, I go to-- I went to-- on a beach vacation with my wife this summer,
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   and everybody had these E-ink Kindles.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   That's where I see it is.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   Perfect on the beach.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.280]   Outside.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   That's where you want it.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.280]   Outside where it's sunny.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   You can't read an iPad outside.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   Split glass displays are not great on the sun.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   No, I'm a total agreement.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   I love the Kindle.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   I think it's a fantastic product.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   I use the paperwhite.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   I don't know if I should upgrade to this.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   If it's going to be that much better.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   Are you excited about the fire phone?
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   Do you think that's going to be something you're going to want to use?
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   I might use it.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   It's kind of locked though.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   Well, locked to AT&T.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   AT&T.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.280]   AT&T exclusive.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   That's one of the other problems with it is it's only available for one.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   I think that's why it's not selling.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   Well, a lot of people use AT&T.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   They're the second biggest carrier.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   Maybe the biggest now.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   Does it have a CDMA radio in it?
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   I doubt it.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   No.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:08.840]   I think Amazon's idea of why people are loyal to Amazon maybe is a little misguided and
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.120]   that something like their phone is just not.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   People just don't think of Amazon as the provider for that.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   I love Amazon.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   I've got lots of their products.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   It's a cry.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.400]   But I would never use an Amazon phone.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.280]   I am loyal to Amazon because of Prime.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Pure and simple.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.040]   I can get it in two days.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.520]   And they've got the video streaming and stuff, which is nice.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   It's okay.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520]   That's not the reason you got it.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   It didn't tell why I bought Prime.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   I bought Prime for second day delivery.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   Free.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   Free second day delivery.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   I mean, that's compelling.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.320]   Free with your purchase of Prime.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.320]   They lose money on it.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   They lose money on Prime.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.000]   It's a big user like yourself.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Right.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Sure.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.720]   I mentioned, I think I mentioned this before in Dogfight, the book about Amazon and Google
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.320]   and the battle I was talking about.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.760]   I guess it was in the Everything store.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.720]   It was in the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.920]   They priced Prime just randomly, basically.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.680]   People came to Bezos and said, "We don't know how much it's going to cost because you
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.160]   can't tell how much people are going to use it."
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.360]   He's got a sense of these things.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.320]   And he said, "We're going to make it 75 bucks."
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.320]   He just buy fiat.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   Yeah, that would be right.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   And it turned out to be about right.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.360]   I mentioned it was funny, but they get a lot of sales.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   Right.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.680]   No, I think that's the way a good entrepreneur does.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.960]   He doesn't study it to death.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.160]   They would have never rolled it out.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.160]   Yes, exactly.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.680]   But I do notice they're raising it to 99.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.160]   I'm still, I think that that's--
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   It's a push in it.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.160]   It's an elastic price point.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   We get so much value out of it.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.280]   There are so many people they lose.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.400]   I am getting a free year because I bought that fire phone, so that was a good deal.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.920]   You don't get that.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   Just the phone.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.560]   Oh, that's a chip.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.320]   You got something as gypsies?
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.360]   Oh, now here we go.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.320]   Oh, there we go.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.320]   Amazon is number one.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.800]   The number one search advertiser on Google.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.960]   That makes sense.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.640]   $158 million in search ads in 2013.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.280]   I guess there's nothing to say about that.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   Nope, yep.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   Are you surprised?
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.280]   Yup.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.320]   They have added a new top level domain name.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.760]   You know that the-- this was kind of crazy.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.520]   I can't decide that if you had enough money, you could make up a domain name.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   And it would be yours.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.280]   It's a quarter of a million, I think.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:20.400]   Amazon paid $4.6 million for dot buy.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   And--
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   Tech.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.680]   It got nothing but money to throw away.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:29.240]   $4.6 million for the dot buy top level domain.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   There was an auction.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.440]   That's why there's a certain fee.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   I think you should buy dot twit.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   I don't have 4.6.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   Well, I don't know how much it would go for.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.440]   No, I think it's a quarter meal.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.960]   I think that would maybe.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.120]   But I think that was bid it up.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   No, yeah, it was bid up.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.560]   In fact, the one that sold for the most was bought by a company called Dot Tech LLC.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   They got--
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   Dot Tech.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   Damn.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.760]   For $6.76 million.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.280]   This was a great idea to make money.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   Who's making this money?
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   I can.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   I can.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   Folks, I guess.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   What does I can't do?
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   Are they having big parties?
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.760]   Yeah, that's what I'd be doing.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:11.280]   Dot Tech beat out Google, Uniregistry, new.com, donuts, and mines plus machines for this.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.360]   Did they say we'll sell somebody the dot yacht domain if they'll buy us a yacht?
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.360]   Was there like a deal at the--
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   Dot yaw.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   I like it.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:25.160]   So mines and machines, having been out bid for Dot Tech, bid $3 million and got Dot VIP.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   Wow.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   Geez.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:31.320]   I guess they're a registry and they figure, well, we'll probably make it back by charging
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.640]   people $25 or $50 a year to have, you know, Leo Dot VIP.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   Who needs it?
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.440]   That sounds like a good domain name.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   Leo Dot V--
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.480]   The chat room the other day said, hey, I bought Leo Dot Ninja for you.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.480]   Great.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   Thank you.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.640]   That reminds me to buy Leo Dot plumbing.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:54.320]   Oh, Leo Dot Ninja's mine.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.320]   Oh, mine.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.400]   I did buy Snell Dot Zone the other week.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   Did you?
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   Snell Dot Zone.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   What did cost you?
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.400]   Oh, you know, a good 15 bucks.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   Hover has a ton of--
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.640]   Yeah, but yeah, I have a hover problem.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   You have a hover problem?
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   I do.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.880]   We need a 12-step for hover addicts.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.280]   I wish they bought a ad this week.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.920]   I could do the ad right now.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:16.320]   Let me log onto my hover and I'll show you-- let's see what I have here.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.720]   I should wait for them to sponsor before you tell us.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   Oh, oh.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.240]   The chat room says some poor ninja actually named Leo.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.440]   Oh, no, he's got a gold.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.440]   God damn it.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   Squatters.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   Squatters, I see.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.440]   Squatters.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.640]   I got verified Dot Zone because I was thinking and verified Dot Rocks.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.640]   It verified Dot Social.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.320]   I was thinking of a new social network where you have to be verified.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   I think I told you about that.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.720]   I'm verified Dot Rocks.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.040]   Or is that for a site where rocks are verified?
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.440]   And I guarantee this rock.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   That is a rock.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.160]   I guess I didn't get any other-- can I have somebody?
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.560]   Oh, twit.agency, twit.careers, twit.company.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.560]   I own these.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:11.740]   Twit.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:17.620]   I just had to sell them off, but luckily you were thinking ahead.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   You know, I've got a hover problem.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   You named it.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   That's exactly what's wrong.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.620]   12-step.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.620]   Let's take a break while I register.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:28.380]   You just take a break while the 49ers lose this game.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:29.900]   Oh, I'm just depressed.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.900]   They're about to lose it.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.100]   They were ahead 14 to nothing.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:35.380]   And they're 14 to 6, and the next thing you know, they lose the game.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.940]   They cannot score in the second half.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.940]   They're like a first half team now.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.980]   Well, I guess I'm going home to cold, hot dogs.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.420]   Didn't you go to the game?
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.420]   The big opening game?
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.420]   The big game?
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.220]   I wanted to talk to you about that when you get back from this commercial.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.860]   I'll tell you what, let's do right now.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.260]   This was such a good week on Twit.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.700]   I wanted you to just see some of the great moments.
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:57.900]   I didn't-- what is it?
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.900]   What?
[00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:59.900]   What?
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.900]   We call it a house ad.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900]   I like to see one of those.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.900]   In cam 3,000 of the future video podcast.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.900]   Rain Camry, thousands.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   I don't care anymore.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.900]   Previously on Twit.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900]   Tech News Tonight.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.180]   Microsoft's bought Minecraft for $2.5 billion.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:20.540]   It's about gaining access to this massive community of gamers and walk with them toward
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.060]   some of their other products.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.060]   Matt Break Weekly.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.060]   This U2 thing seems to me to be a fiasco.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.980]   Does it qualify as a fiasco?
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.140]   Does it qualify as someone should get fired from this?
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.180]   I think it's embarrassing that Apple had to publish a page that says, oh, oh, here's
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.420]   how you get rid of that.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.580]   Triangulation.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.020]   Our guest is Lawrence Kraus, physicist, author.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:44.180]   You know, I'm quite proud of the fact that the research I do has no practical use whatsoever.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.540]   Any more than a great symphony does or lack a beautiful painting.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.540]   Tech News Today.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:56.140]   You got to love this, Jason, because it's like all these attributes of the iPhones that
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.580]   have been around in the Android world for ages.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.380]   Welcome to the world of large format phones.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.140]   They're actually pretty useful.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.420]   Don't feel guilty about it.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   It's OK.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420]   Twit.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.420]   Now, where did I put my iPhone?
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   You were in New York.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.420]   No, no, oh!
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.300]   That was not the first drop test, but it was the last to come home.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.300]   So he didn't crack it?
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300]   No.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.300]   I thought he cracked it.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   Oh, that's good.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.300]   It survived.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.300]   It's very crackable.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.860]   Hey, does it sound plastic when you tap it?
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.860]   Yeah, it does.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   It's really awesome.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.860]   Everybody's got it.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.620]   There's nothing special back at real class.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.620]   We got the week ahead.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   Mr. Mike Elgin, our news director.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.020]   He's going to be covering some big stories.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.020]   Mike?
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.900]   This week, Blackberry is announcing new products on Wednesday, September 24th at events in
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.540]   Toronto, London, and Dubai.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:46.180]   We're expecting the company to unveil the Blackberry Passport, which is a wide boxy
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.540]   fablet with a physical keyboard.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.980]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:59.620]   So many people have said, "Leo, aren't you excited about the Blackberry Passport?"
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.620]   It's square, right?
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.620]   Or square-ish.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.620]   Um...
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.620]   Jokers.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.140]   I think people that are just making fun of you.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.980]   No, you think they're pulling my chain?
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.980]   Yes.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.140]   It looks like an onion thing.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   It doesn't look real.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   Yeah, it's an onion.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.460]   It looks like a parody.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.460]   I want it.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.460]   You know, I don't...
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.580]   I wish no eel to Blackberry.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.540]   I had a Blackberry pager in the early days.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.180]   I loved my Blackberry effect right up to the iPhone came out.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.180]   I was a Blackberry user.
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.180]   Um...
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:33.340]   But I look at this and I think, "Boy, is it...
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.300]   Is it like pop tart sized?"
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.860]   I don't say you could hurt yourself in those corners.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.860]   There...
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.540]   I will get e-mail from people who will say, "How could you be dissing the Blackberry Passport?"
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.940]   Are you going to get e-mail people saying something no matter what you do?
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.140]   You've learned this in your long and august career.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.140]   People hate you.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.140]   You...
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.140]   How do you deal with that?
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.860]   Because you've always been a lightning rod up.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.860]   You...
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.860]   I try to be...
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.860]   And you're doing this...
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:03.860]   You're trying to be annoying.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.860]   Not annoying, but provocative.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.860]   Provocative.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.860]   Provocative.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.860]   Yes, exactly.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:09.860]   I think that's a fairer.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.860]   No, maybe.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.860]   I try to bring up things that people are going to...
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.160]   But you must get hate mail.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   You must have been getting hate mail for the last 20 years.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.060]   I don't get as much as I used to.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.260]   Do you want to give out the e-mail address in case...
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260]   JonathanVork.org.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260]   I don't have a problem.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.260]   I'm the pump.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.060]   I get no spam.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   So, you know, and I can...
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.780]   I also block people.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.780]   I have a...
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.900]   The system where...
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.500]   It's Mark Perkel's e-mail system.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   You're still using that?
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.700]   C times C-T-Y-M-E dot com.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.340]   And I think he's a good e-mail provider.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.740]   And all the mail goes through there and his spam filter has been very effective for it.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.060]   Very good, yeah.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.060]   And look.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.060]   And there's the John C. DeVork.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.340]   I get no spam logo.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:52.780]   That comes from probably a 2006 episode of Twit.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780]   Before that, I think.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780]   Even earlier?
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780]   Even earlier.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780]   2005, maybe.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   When did you start?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   2005.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.620]   Yeah, it was definitely in 2005.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.460]   I get no spam.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   So, I don't carry.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.500]   I put my e-mail address here and they'll make any difference.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.660]   No, by this time, if they don't have your e-mail address.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.860]   Well, I get the biggest, you get people that can't find my e-mail address.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:17.460]   It's like, "Just like the day I get people who tweet me and say, "Whatever happened to
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.860]   you, Leo, do you do anything anymore?"
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.860]   And yeah, this is a...
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   This is always abusive to me.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.380]   I was a fan of the screen savers and I just lost track of you.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.820]   Are you around anywhere?
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.820]   Are you working?
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.820]   Are you...
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.820]   You're doing anything?
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.820]   You're doing anything.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820]   I really liked it back in the day when you were doing something.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.060]   Now you're not doing anything.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.940]   You're not doing anything.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.100]   There is a little concern in the Android world.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.260]   A cross website flop, browser flaw.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:46.780]   It's not in the Chrome browser that currently comes with Android distributions, but so many
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:52.300]   Android users, about half, still use pretty old versions of Android that they're vulnerable
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.300]   to this.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.260]   You have to be using the original Android browser that used to come with Android phones.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.820]   It's called the AOSP Android open source platform browser.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.420]   It allows malicious sites to inject JavaScript to other sites, which means that they could
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:14.500]   read cookies, password, fields, submit forms, grab, keyboard input.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.500]   It's a very bad...
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.940]   What version of Android did we talk about here?
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.420]   It was changing 4.2.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.420]   So anything...
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   That's pretty recent.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420]   Anything prior to 4.2...
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.340]   I don't even think my phone's...
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.940]   Now you can fix it very simply by just not using the AOSP browser and starting to use
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   Chrome.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:37.780]   However, I think there are still parts of the browser embedded into web views in other
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.780]   applications.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.340]   So you have to be careful about what applications you use.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.420]   Can you delete that browser in the older version of it?
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.420]   You can't.
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.420]   Well, you need the functionality.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.260]   So it's just like Internet Explorer and Windows.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.940]   It's used to render web pages and email and other programs.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.740]   So I don't think you can just kill it.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.140]   I've never heard this.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   Android browser is actually around half of all Android users still in pre-4.2.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.580]   Yeah, well, if I'm on 4.3, which is a...
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580]   You're on...
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580]   That's an XS5.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   Well, it's actually not.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580]   It's an older one.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]   A 4.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580]   No.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   3.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580]   No, this is...
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580]   The Galaxy.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580]   The Galaxy Nexus.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.580]   Well, that's pretty old.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.580]   It's as very old as 4.3.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.580]   It has...
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.580]   Look, there's not a scratch on it.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.300]   I keep my keys in the same pocket.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.260]   This phone is built to last.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.340]   This was the last great Nexus phone.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.300]   I love the Nexus 1, which was its predecessor.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   I agree with you.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   Well, you mean the...
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.700]   Yeah, a little track.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.700]   The original one.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.700]   Yeah, the original Nexus.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   That really old, crummy one.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   It was a great phone.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700]   Yeah, sure.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.700]   That was a great phone.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.100]   No, it was one of the most elegant, beautiful phones ever made.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.700]   It was a clunker.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.140]   All right.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.140]   Okay, fine.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.140]   Now look, look, look.
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.140]   Look, look, look.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.140]   Check this out.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.140]   Look at these different side-by-side.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   They're the same.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   They're the same.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.140]   They're the same.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.700]   This is the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:54.780]   That's the Fire Phone.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.180]   All phones are basically black slabs.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.660]   What difference does it make?
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.660]   It's a black slab.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.900]   Why are people buying new phones?
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.900]   Why buy an...
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.700]   Oh, because this black slab has more black.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   How much black could it be?
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.140]   The answer is none more black.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   Better black.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.580]   Anyway, now you have a Fire Phone 2.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.900]   You live it up.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.900]   I don't...
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:20.860]   Users of Android 4.0 and up can switch to Chrome, Firefox or Opera.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.540]   You want to be careful about other third-party browsers because they may be using the AOSP
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.540]   code.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.580]   Google has offered the following statement to Peter Breyer's Technica.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.140]   We have reviewed this report and Android users running Chrome as their browser or those
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.100]   who are on Android 4.4 plus are not affected for earlier versions of Android.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.780]   We've released patches.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.900]   So you'll want to make sure you've got those patches.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.060]   It's a serious flaw.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   I'd say.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.340]   Speaking of Android, the new Moto X is...
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.620]   Well, pre-orders began last week.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.900]   I'm getting my leather-bound Moto X Friday.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   I'm very excited.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   You're going to stand in line?
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   Oh, wait.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   There's no place to stand in line.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   There's no place.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900]   There's no store.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.340]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.060]   It doesn't surprise me.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.620]   I'm getting an unlocked version.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.820]   Oh, that's a good thing.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   Yep.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.220]   Actually, I found...
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.420]   You can tell me this.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.300]   When we were in line at the Apple Store, they said we have no unlocked phones.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.660]   I said, "What about the T-Mobile phone?"
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.940]   When the Apple guys, and I talked to several of them, said, "No, no, that's locked to T-Mobile.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.940]   It's not, right?"
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.940]   No, it's not.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.940]   They were lying to you.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.460]   Right, but it may be a variation that doesn't have all the frequencies, so it might not be
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.460]   able to do...
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.220]   So there are different skews of the iPhone 6.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.140]   I think that was true of the 5.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:41.020]   I'm not sure whether it's true of the 6 or not, but it may be that...
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.620]   It looks that way in the back of the box.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:49.500]   The T-Mobile iPhone might not work or might not work at speed on a different LTE network.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.420]   The other thing I found I'm very excited about.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   So this is the Verizon iPhone 6, and once again, the SIM slot is unlocked.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.900]   It's CDMA though.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:58.900]   No.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.700]   No, because LTC requires a SIM.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.700]   So I can put...
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.340]   But the phone itself is CDMA, if it's Verizon.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   They're not using...
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.820]   The main calling part of the phone is CDMA.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.820]   Yeah, so I'm saying.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.340]   Nobody uses the main calling part of the phone.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.540]   I know I'm completely in alien territory.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.260]   I put a T-Mobile SIM in this.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.700]   I was able to make phone calls.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.700]   What?
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   Yes.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:21.180]   It's been that way for the last, at least two years, two generations.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.820]   So there is an unlocked Apple iPhone from Verizon.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.820]   If you're traveling, this is a good choice.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.860]   It's Verizon, CDMA, and LTE.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.860]   Are they using voiceover LTE yet?
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.860]   They will shoot us.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.860]   I know.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   They're not yet.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860]   They're not switching it on in some market.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   Turn it off.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.820]   And then when you travel, as I'm going to be next week to London...
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:41.820]   You pop in a...
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:42.820]   It's going on in London.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.820]   It's from 3 for £10.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.740]   I'm going for the iTunes Festival.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.740]   I'm very excited.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:47.740]   Go see.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.900]   Plathad of the Minkavon.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900]   You go in all the way to London.
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.460]   Does it plathad of the Minkavon?
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   Okay.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   That's exciting.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   That's exciting.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.580]   Actually, a program note, this show will begin one hour earlier next week at 2pm Pacific
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.580]   5pm Eastern.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.060]   Did you take an off right after this show?
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.420]   I have a flight to catch.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.020]   I'm going to run out the door after the show and...
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   Ooh!
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.020]   Flight to see plathad of the Minkavon.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.020]   So you go to...
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020]   Don't you see him cheaper than a flight to London?
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:15.180]   We're going to London for vacation, but I will be seeing the last day of the iTunes Festival.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.180]   I'm very excited.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.700]   What is the iTunes Festival?
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.700]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.700]   The music the kids are listening to these days.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.700]   John, John, John.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.100]   Apple does this every year.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.980]   It's a bunch of people get together and download music.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.860]   Is Bono going to be playing?
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.580]   Bono will be there as will 50 cents.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.580]   50 cents.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   I think you'll enjoy.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.580]   Yes, I think you'll be able to watch it.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.580]   What are the old farts you're going to be playing?
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.300]   And this kids festival.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.220]   Have you seen the Robert Plant performance on iTunes from the iTunes?
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.220]   I haven't.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.220]   This year.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.220]   It's wonderful.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.260]   The guy's still got it.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   He was maybe by his album.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.020]   I saw it last night.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.700]   He was fabulous with...
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   What's your name?
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.700]   Allison Krauss.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.700]   Allison Krauss was a great album.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.420]   He's really into world music and all different kinds.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.820]   And if so, if you have Apple TV, it's on there.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.300]   The full performance.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   12 songs.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.020]   He does a really interesting version of Whole Lotta Love that blends in.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.420]   Bo Diddly's Who Do You Love?
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   It's really.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.220]   It's a great performance.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.820]   It's over now, but Dead Mouse kicked it off back.
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.020]   Was there Tony Bennett on the 6th?
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.260]   Tony Bennett.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.260]   You've heard of him?
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260]   Placibo.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.260]   Elbow.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.260]   Elbow.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.860]   I'm not kidding.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.180]   The kids, they got wacky.
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.100]   Feral, you know, Feral Williams, of course.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.100]   Maroon 5.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.500]   You're going to go check out some of the bands.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   You're going to be dancing.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.940]   You're going to be taking some E.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.500]   Placido Domingo is an opera.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   I'm going to take some E.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.500]   Or is it X?
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500]   He means vitamin C.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.500]   I might have been the E.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   He's talking about it.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.060]   Yeah, you're just good for the heart.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.140]   I'm in the molly.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.660]   And I'm going to see this guy, Kenny Rogers.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.900]   No, it's not Kenny Rogers.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   Placito Domingo.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   Okay.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900]   He's an opera singer, you know.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:58.900]   Yeah, I've heard of him.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.900]   Looking forward to that.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.660]   So, yeah, so that's just a program.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:08.620]   So you'll go to, when I was in London, I went to the like three, which offers prepaid
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.620]   for like--
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.620]   Exactly.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.620]   And Papa Sim in there.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620]   Unlimited data.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   Unlimited data.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.620]   Pounds.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.620]   30 pounds.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.620]   That's a great deal.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.620]   For how long?
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.620]   But you've got to have an unlocked phone to do.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.620]   For a month.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.620]   And you have to have an unlocked phone.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.620]   So I was very pleased.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.620]   And I didn't know because there was a rumor that Apple would or Verizon would be locking
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620]   the Sim slot.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.620]   Somebody told me on chat, and I don't know if this is true or on Twitter, that the FCC
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.620]   prohibits them.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.620]   It was a some sort of--
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.620]   Wow.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:38.260]   I think these locking things are silly at this point because you're in a contract.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.620]   You've got to pay to get out of it.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620]   Absolutely.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.620]   Why?
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620]   So what do you think?
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   It's hurting savvy people who don't want to pay the--
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.860]   Well, it actually saves them money because people can unlock the phone after the contract
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   is over.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.580]   But it's a rigamarole that costs them time and money to do.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.580]   Just leave it unlocked.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.180]   Put makeup sign at the dotted line and you're good to go.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.740]   Actually, and I don't know what carrier he represents, but a listener heard that I was
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:04.260]   going to London and they're going to drop off a MyFi card as well.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.260]   Oh, nice.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.260]   So we'll have Wi-Fi.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.260]   Oh, you'll be all wired up.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.260]   I'll be all wired up.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.420]   It's like you never left home.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.060]   But I thought I'd also bring the Moto X.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.060]   And--
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.060]   I might as well bring 10 phones.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.060]   I got the complete set.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.060]   So I got the Moto X--
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.540]   You want the fire phone back?
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.380]   You should get a-- you should get a-- somebody make a leather potter and you have all these
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.380]   phones stuck in like some sort of bandit-o.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.300]   It's the Pontiac leather back.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.740]   And then I got the leather back on the hint.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.740]   That's the--
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.740]   What's the hint?
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.860]   Well, it's like the Scarlett Johansson earpiece that goes in for them and you talk to your
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.420]   phone through it.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:40.020]   It's a Bluetooth headpiece designed for the Moto X.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.020]   So it has some additional features.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.020]   You don't have to touch it.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   You just say, hey.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   That's good.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.780]   And it will respond to you.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   And then--
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.780]   Diling mom.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.180]   You look like an idiot, but that's okay.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.900]   And then it only has like, I think three hours battery life.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:54.900]   So you can only leave one.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.380]   Well, you have enough phones on you.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.340]   It's not going to be a big deal that you would--
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.340]   I have good.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.940]   Can I get a utility belt or something like a Batman thing that just--
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:02.940]   Yeah, one phone.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.340]   And when it goes dead you get out of the next one.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340]   The Moto 360.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.420]   The round Moto 360.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.420]   They should lock you up.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.460]   Well, I have a little disappointed utility belt.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.460]   That you have to use a Pebble watch with the iPhone.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.460]   There's no other-- right?
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.740]   That's the only watch that will work with the iPhone is the Pebble.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:19.740]   Right now.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.740]   Right now.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.060]   Working great with iOS 8 again, finally.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.060]   Very nice.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.060]   The Pebble.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.060]   Yeah, they update other software for iOS 8 and it works really well.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.900]   Awesome.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.980]   And let's see.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   Yeah, OK.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.980]   And that's that.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.740]   Android browser flaw.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.740]   Google launched phones in India.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.060]   The Android one phones for $105.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.460]   It's kind of high.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.540]   It seems like it's not cheap.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.340]   No, it's too high.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.340]   It's unsubsidized.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:46.860]   Still.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.620]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.900]   You can buy phones for $100.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.460]   It's pretty useful.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.900]   Support seven local languages and offline YouTube playback,
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.900]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.620]   That's different.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:02.140]   And, Alil, what's not on your list,
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.500]   I'm kind of astonished that it's not here,
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.300]   is Larry Ellison quitting or--
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.540]   Oh my gosh, I forgot that.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   That's not on the list.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.580]   So let's talk about it.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.740]   When we come back, Larry Ellison exits Oracle.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.700]   He's the last of the grand horsemen of the computer era.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:18.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.300]   Well, you're one of the horsemen.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.300]   A no.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   I think you were--
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   I think you were--
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.300]   Horsebabies horse--
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300]   Horsebabies, horsebabies.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.580]   There was gates, there was jobs, there was Nolan Bushnell.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.100]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.540]   No, no, you don't even know.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.860]   I don't know where they are.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:32.740]   On your right.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.420]   That's why I'm going to ask you who they are.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:34.940]   I can tell you.
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:35.620]   When we come back.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.700]   The great-- the great-- the Mount Rushmore.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.740]   Where are we supposed to talk about the Niners or something
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:41.740]   after the last F?
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.660]   We pulled the TV away.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.500]   The game's over.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:44.860]   The game's over.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.700]   I have stopped watching.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.780]   You should just give up on these things.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:48.900]   And you renounce football.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.060]   I renounce football in all its forms.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:51.780]   I liked it too.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.500]   I think renouncing football is a good idea.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.660]   I have to admit, on the bus home after the last game,
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.660]   because we took the bus down to--
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.180]   Took the bus.
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.340]   Beautiful stadium, by the way.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:58.860]   Off the--
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.020]   You love the stadium.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.060]   They haven't won a game in it.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:01.860]   But yeah, it's a great--
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.380]   Now they've only played one game there.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.700]   Well, a few pre-season.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.500]   All right, you're right.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.500]   They haven't won a game there.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.100]   I did strip my Colin Kaepernick jersey right off of me.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:09.620]   No, you did.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:10.260]   You're a homeless guy.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:10.660]   No, you did.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.420]   You be number seven.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.980]   Nice try.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.740]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps--
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.420]   No, I didn't.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:15.780]   I know.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.980]   Is I'm not a fair weather fan?
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.700]   No.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.180]   I know.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.580]   You bleed the gold and red and purple and whatever.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.380]   Yes.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:25.820]   What are the Niners' colors?
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.140]   Anyway, no, I know that.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.420]   I was wearing my puffy gold jacket too.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.100]   A little puffy gold.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.300]   I throw back puffy gold.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.260]   I think, yeah.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.620]   That's my rapper name, by the way.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.900]   Puffy gold.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.980]   That's a good name.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.180]   They had Snoop Dogg at the halftime show.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.540]   What was he doing there?
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.700]   He sang.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.900]   What was he singing for?
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:44.500]   What did he sing?
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.060]   There's big hit.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.020]   The barks-- the barks stops here.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.220]   The barks stops here?
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:49.300]   What wasn't that?
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.740]   What's his big hit?
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.660]   I don't know.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.900]   Rough rough.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.660]   I'm Wolf Wolf.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.540]   We don't know.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.220]   Nobody knows.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.620]   Nobody cares.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.420]   Our show did you have parachute pants
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.220]   as somebody in the chat and runs to know.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:03.540]   You can't touch this.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.020]   OK.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.260]   Snoop was good.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.900]   It's kind of a different halftime show.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.540]   That's what he's doing.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.300]   It was all right.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.820]   It was good.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.260]   That would have been very bummed out
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:15.820]   by that particular game.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.260]   I'm going to call myself puff goldy,
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.500]   but then next year it'll be pea goldy.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.740]   Pea goldy.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.500]   Yes.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.220]   We're just going to have to stop now.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.340]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.300]   Why go to the post office when you can print your own US
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:31.900]   postage?
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.620]   That's what I say.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.980]   Right from your computer and your print.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.700]   And I ain't talking counterfeit in here.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.260]   And I ain't talking a postage meter
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.180]   with special expense special, and quote, special ink.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.020]   That's very expensive.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.020]   It's just your regular thing.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.220]   In fact, Stamps.com is so great.
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.380]   You know, sometimes postage meters,
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.700]   I think they charge you when the postage rates change.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.260]   You have to bring it to the post office.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.900]   And they go, I hope they've changed that by now.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.780]   No, they haven't.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.460]   Stamps.com, it's automatic.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.420]   And they don't charge you.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.900]   In fact, it's the best way to buy and print postage.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:03.540]   If you are in the business where you're mailing stuff,
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.780]   even if it's brochures or bills,
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.620]   but especially if it's packages, if you're
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.580]   selling on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:14.820]   if you need Stamps.com, it turns your mail fulfillment
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.260]   is something that's professional, works well,
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.740]   and looks great.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.580]   In fact, you can even print those right on the envelope
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.500]   if you're presenting something in a mail in an envelope
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.740]   with your company logo, the return address,
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.900]   print for any size package, print for any style of mail.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.980]   You even get discounts you cannot get at the post office.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.260]   And unlike the post office, Stamps.com never closes.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.620]   So at 24/7, you're able to do your stuff.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.700]   Important addresses from your address book
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.700]   use cost codes to track postage by spending
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.980]   by customer, automatic address verification,
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.460]   and discounted package insurance.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.020]   All in one click, plus you don't have to hand write forms
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:53.220]   ever.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.300]   And I always think that looks a little amateurish.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.380]   You want to-- it's all printed out,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:00.260]   including the customs forms for international mailing,
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.820]   the certified mail return receipts.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.180]   They'll send an email out to your recipient saying,
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.220]   here's the code, it is great.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.940]   You save up to 80% compared to a postage meter
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.380]   and no more time consuming trips to the post office.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.100]   Say, uniformed representative of the federal government
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.420]   will come to your door, aka your mail carrier,
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.100]   and take your mail away.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.740]   Right now use my promo code, Twit.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.300]   We've got a special offer for you.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.020]   Just click that microphone in the upper right hand corner.

[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.260]   have exactly the right postage.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.220]   No more extra stamps, just so you don't get it returned.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.300]   And $55 in free postage to use over the first few months
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:40.780]   of your account.

[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.580]   Go to stamps.com before you do anything else.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.940]   Click the microphone.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:52.300]   Type in Twit, stamps.com.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.180]   No longer have to create a Google+ profile
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.700]   when you sign up for Gmail.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.260]   Google's really backing down on Google+.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.460]   I don't understand why.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.260]   I like Google+.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.380]   Why would they--
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.940]   I don't understand why they would go to all this trouble.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:04.940]   And then just--
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.060]   That's what they do.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.020]   I think there's some bad--
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.540]   I think they're admitting that they let their corporate strategy
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.220]   beat out good user experience.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:12.540]   Maybe that's it.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.940]   Like shoehorning too much into it.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.820]   They just assumed everything Google was going to run through there.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.900]   I don't like people having them race like that.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:19.540]   You know?
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.020]   And it crippled some of their other features.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.140]   Like Hangouts is actually a really great feature.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.940]   And yet it was extremely confusing on how to use it.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.500]   Because it was so intertwined with Google+.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:32.100]   And since pushing them apart a little bit,
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.100]   it's improved Hangouts.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.540]   So I bet there were people inside Google saying,
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.340]   why do we have to do it this way?
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.780]   And finally, they backed off a little.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.100]   So Larry Ellison, stepping down at Oracle, Mark Heard,
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.700]   and somebody named Sassefras are now--
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:47.660]   I have to go over D.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.420]   I have to go to the cat.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.780]   Oh, sorry.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:50.580]   Sassegas.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.300]   What?
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:52.380]   Sassefras.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.820]   What cats are running Oracle now?
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:55.860]   Was it Heard?
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.100]   Heard the H.D.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.100]   H.D.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.740]   CEO that was forced out of HP.
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.300]   Yeah, for being a Texas guy.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.420]   For harassing--
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.660]   --in this day of age of--
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.140]   I think he's-- what was he--
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.220]   I can't remember the details.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.220]   But then he then moved it.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:08.700]   He followed up.
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:09.140]   He came in.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.060]   He was the cleanup person behind Carly Fiorina.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:16.260]   And then someone had to come in and clean up behind him.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.780]   There was a sexual harassment suit.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.340]   Right.
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.220]   Hired somebody who basically was there
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.020]   kind of to be his hanger on.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.660]   And he was accused of harassing her.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.060]   And I remember Larry Ellison at the time,
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:33.180]   when Heard was fired, saying that's the stupidest thing
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.260]   I ever heard, I'm going to hire him.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:35.760]   Right.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.700]   And next thing you know, he takes me
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.660]   and he's running the company.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:38.540]   So Larry was serious.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.460]   Well, Heard was also the CEO while all that stuff
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.300]   with the pretexting with the board was going on.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.700]   Right.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.220]   So that is that as well.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:49.980]   Heard will run sales marketing and strategy.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.220]   Safra Katz will be chief financial officer
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.940]   and oversee legal and manufacturing operations.
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.660]   Ellison, of course, is not leaving the company.
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:59.220]   He'll be chairman of the board, replacing Jeff Henley,
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:01.180]   who's going back to his career at the Eagles.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.700]   And he's also going to take on the title Eagles.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.500]   And Jeff Henley of the Eagles.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.060]   Hotel California?
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.180]   That's not that, Jeff Henley?
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.180]   I don't think so.
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.420]   He's also going to take on the title of chief technology
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.100]   officer.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.940]   Now he is 70 years old.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.740]   He's a vital, good looking man for that age.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.260]   Ellison?
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.340]   Ellen Tony Stark.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.220]   He's Tony Stark.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:20.060]   Is he Tony Stark?
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.980]   No, he's not Tony Stark.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.060]   Must kiss Tony Stark.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.380]   Larry Ellison, one of the richest guys in the world, he--
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.180]   He gave up on trying to catch Bill Gates.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.900]   The company, Oracle, I don't know
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.100]   how has a capitalization of $185 billion annual revenue
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.820]   of $38 billion.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.100]   This is big iron databases.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.500]   Wow.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500]   Is it a good product?
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.380]   I can't afford it.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.940]   It's dominant, I guess, at that price.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.940]   So is he not like Bill Gates, like Steve Jobs, one of the guys?
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.260]   He founded Oracle in 1977.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.340]   He ran it ever since.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.380]   He's always big iron, though.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.780]   He doesn't count as one of the--
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:02.820]   He's an enterprise guy.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:06.580]   There's a lot of enterprise guys.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.340]   I mean, he wouldn't call John Acres, for example,
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.180]   some founding father of the computer revolution.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.660]   Gina Smith worked with him.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.340]   It was very close to him.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.420]   I can't remember if she worked on a book with him.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.220]   No, no, Net.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.340]   She's got a net ink.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.340]   Net, which was a--
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.140]   something.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.020]   Which was a thin client--
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.420]   Thin client, right?
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.780]   She was the champion.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.700]   He was a big champion.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.980]   He was a big champion of the dumb terminal.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.380]   We'll run our software, which ultimately
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.180]   has become cloud computing.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:39.020]   Which is why I think he was always annoyed with the term
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.260]   cloud computing, because it was like he's kind of playing
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.340]   that game all along.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.260]   And then this comes along with this.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.980]   There's a difference between client server computing
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.820]   and cloud computing.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:47.700]   There's really now.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.420]   I do think so.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.380]   I think a cloud computer is still a computer
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.700]   with a CPO, its own storage and memory.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.100]   But data is synced and stored in the cloud.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.420]   Google Chromebook.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:00.620]   That's more like a thin client, I agree.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.460]   But it does have its own CPU.
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.740]   The processing power--
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.940]   Well, there hasn't been a terminal made since 1980
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.340]   that doesn't have a CPU in it.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.740]   Well, but how much of a CPU?
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.980]   Usually it's just enough to communicate with the cloud.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.460]   This thing is a full-blown computer.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.460]   I mean, it could do all the same--
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.420]   The Chromebook.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.220]   But you're right, it's much more like a thin client
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.620]   than anything else.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.700]   And I think it's the same thing.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.580]   Just repackaged.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.100]   Larry owns the island of Lanai.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:27.620]   Yes.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.120]   Nice.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:28.980]   He bought that in 2012.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.540]   It's a leper island.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.060]   Very, very--
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.300]   No, that's from a car.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.300]   --that's from a car.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:33.900]   Wow.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:34.540]   It was a nice--
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.140]   Lanai is where Bill Gates got married, right?
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:36.500]   Yes, it is.
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:37.500]   Bill and the Gates got married.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.460]   They went it up in the island.
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:42.300]   It's not that Larry is going to build his super secret layer.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.500]   He's become up and down and James Bond has to go in.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:44.860]   It's not secret.
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.500]   It tells everybody about it, Leo.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:46.860]   Oh, yes.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:49.340]   He only bought it because Gates got married there.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.620]   And he says, I'll up the anti-on bill.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.860]   It turns out he's going to build hotels there.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:55.100]   It's going to be very lucrative.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:56.420]   It's a business decision.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.860]   It sounds better when you say he bought his own island
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.740]   like he's going to live--
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.980]   A lot of people own islands.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.340]   A lot of these really super rich guys.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:02.780]   I love them.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.460]   There's actually some--
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.380]   that doesn't surprise me.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.380]   There's some mud out in Petaluma River that's available.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.020]   I want an island.
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.940]   Yeah, an island next stop for Leo.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.460]   What's a good price of an island?
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:14.740]   Doctor Evil's Island.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.660]   You can buy Red Rock Island over here off the Richmond Bridge
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.700]   for five mil.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.060]   That's not bad.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:21.740]   No, it's not bad.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.620]   It's always been for sale.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.300]   Nobody ever wants to buy.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.220]   That's a little more than this building would be.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.100]   And this one's for sale.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.100]   So you're going to buy this building?
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.780]   No, I want to buy Red Rock.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.900]   Red Rock Island.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.260]   Island.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.500]   Yeah, you have to build on Red Rock.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.860]   Is there any internet on Red Rock?
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.300]   No.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:35.820]   Yes.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.780]   Wireless.
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.820]   Wow.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.860]   Yeah, you have wireless internet.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:44.740]   Larry is worth $46 billion, according to the Bloomberg
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.660]   billionaire, Jin Gick.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:50.460]   He also built-- and Gina told us about this,
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.700]   that Japanese inspired home.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.500]   She said it was beautiful in Silicon Valley.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.140]   Yeah, you can't--
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.060]   he won't let you in.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.180]   Can't give him there.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.060]   I've been to his apartment doing the Pacific Heights.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:25:59.740]   Really?
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.940]   Yeah, and it's pretty aesthetic.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:02.780]   And he's a yachtsman.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.500]   He competed in the America's Cup.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.460]   He used to?
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.180]   Well, does he--
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.180]   And he still runs the boats?
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.300]   Yeah, he runs the boats.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.900]   He's the sponsor of the team that won, I think.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.180]   He also owns one of these.
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.140]   He's owns a bunch of jetties.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.660]   He's a rich guy.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.420]   Rich guy has shown it off.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:18.820]   Flomping.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.940]   If I were 70 and that wealthy, I think I might retire.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.020]   What are you going to make more money?
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.460]   What?
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.060]   I think you should go for it.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.500]   Some say, according to San Francisco Chronicles website,
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.820]   the SFGate, that it's not, in fact,
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:40.420]   he's not really stepping down.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:41.380]   He's--
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.500]   Well, he's the chairman, and he's got these co-CEOs.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.780]   So he's obviously still in control.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.580]   He's technical off, technology off,
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.180]   it sounds like he's still pretty much involved.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.500]   But why do this at all?
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.540]   I mean, if he's still--
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.300]   Obligity.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.540]   If he's still involved, I think there are other ways
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:26:59.940]   he could get--
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.700]   Mike Wilson--
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.620]   He's all of them.
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.140]   Mike Wilson--
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.140]   He's winding down.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.140]   Mike Wilson, who wrote the book, the difference
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.500]   between God and Larry Ellison--
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.300]   God doesn't think he's Larry Ellison.
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:11.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.460]   It's classic.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:12.940]   That's the--
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.340]   Yeah, it's very classic line.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:17.500]   Actually the name of the book, he says,
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.140]   you can give him titles or take away titles,
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.100]   but Larry will have a profound influence in that company
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:21.820]   for a while to come.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.500]   I doubt there's a founder with more power, even Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.700]   than Larry has mentioned.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.180]   Mark's pushed around by a bunch of people.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:31.220]   Is he?
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.060]   Larry only gets a dollar in annual salary.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.140]   Oh, that's always annoys me.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.060]   It's like a scam.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.100]   Steve Jobs, I love you.
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:37.780]   Yeah, it's like--
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.540]   And I get a dollar--
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.020]   Seven million shares of stock.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.180]   That way you get to avoid taxes.
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:47.980]   I'm telling you, I'm advocating wealth tax,
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.100]   because if a wealth tax goes into play,
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.100]   these guys who keep saying they want to be tax more--
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.060]   Only make a book.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.060]   These guys-- well, it doesn't make any difference
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.060]   on the wealth tax you get to--
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:58.060]   And the government still takes half of it.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:58.860]   They don't take any--
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.140]   Because you know, 50 cents this year I paid in taxes.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:02.220]   No.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.980]   Rob Enderle says he's the highest paid person in the valley.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:12.860]   And that he thinks this is all stage managed to make investors
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.300]   who are mad at his, in fact, very high salary, calm down.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.540]   The big investor group says, Enderle,
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.540]   we're having a cow over how much he was making
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.500]   and how badly Oracle was doing.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.860]   Well, if Rob Enderle says it--
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.500]   Must be true.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.500]   --must be true.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.740]   I think it's Rob Enderle.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.180]   It is that there's no wrong--
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.180]   It's Rob Enderle.
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:31.700]   It's Rob Enderle.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.220]   They're just trolling Rob Enderle now.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:33.900]   They're just making a--
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.900]   Ron Enderle.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.660]   --and he really and really soon.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.380]   I think Rob's got a very good take on some of this stuff.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:41.860]   Really?
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860]   I'm sure you do.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.500]   No, he's famous for being quoted.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.100]   Too quoted.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:45.900]   He's quoteable.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.500]   Yeah, because he's got his lines open.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.180]   He's got a phone.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:49.660]   Every phone that goes right to him.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.020]   You can always get a hold of him.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.340]   And he says, what do you want to quote for?
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:53.380]   That's how he answers the phone.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.540]   What do you want to quote for?
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.460]   I give you a quote.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:55.940]   Anything.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:58.860]   And then you say anything you want, and he got a zinger.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.580]   That's good.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.580]   That's a good game.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:02.460]   That's--
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.860]   He started Oracle in 1977 with just $2,000.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.660]   Yeah, that's what he says.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:08.940]   In his pocket.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.500]   Did he write the database?
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:10.820]   Or did he just--
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.060]   Not that I know of.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.620]   What is his skill set?
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.900]   Is his salesman?
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:16.420]   He's Tony Schar.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.020]   Well, definitely a lot of sales skills.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.420]   And--
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.500]   Schmoozer.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   He's a schmoozer.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.780]   Although he's the CTO, so he must hopefully--
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.700]   Yeah, that does get some technical--
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:29.780]   It's like Bill Gates.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:32.260]   It's questionable whether he knows anything, how the database
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.420]   even works anymore.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:39.500]   If anybody gets his brain in a jar,
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.700]   it'll be very Allison.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:43.700]   Tony.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:44.860]   You know, like--
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:45.660]   What did you like?
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:49.860]   If you're a drama, the guy's going to be the president in 3,000.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.300]   Together, brain in a jar.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.420]   Yeah, yeah, I got your brain here, Allison.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.700]   In a jar.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:03.580]   What is a strange way to compliment someone, Leo, really?
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.940]   This is the strangest I've ever heard.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.500]   I don't know what I mean by that.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.780]   Yeah, that guy's a real jar-brain guy.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.540]   You know what I mean.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:14.900]   Everybody gets his brain in a jar.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.940]   I think I'm punchy still from staying up all night for the iPhone.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:21.020]   Totally the iPhone.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:24.220]   As long as I'm on the San Francisco Gate, this is a story.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:26.180]   Now, I know John will have an opinion on this.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:30.900]   But apparently, the taxi industry is just dying in San Francisco
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.460]   because it will be--
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:32.300]   Oh, the three of us.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:33.540]   Oh, man.
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.100]   3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.140]   San Francisco is city with the--
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.260]   that was the worst served by its taxi.
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:40.340]   It was terrible.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:40.860]   Terrible.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.340]   How about it?
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.940]   Big surprise that somebody found an alternative.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:48.700]   The number of taxi trips plummeted 65% in 15 months,
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.220]   according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.140]   Agency.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.700]   That's a big slide.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.940]   The average number of rides per taxi in March 2012
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.860]   was 1,424 a month.
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.820]   It's down to 500.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.580]   I feel bad for the cab drivers whose livelihood is affected
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.020]   by this.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.740]   But this is an example of a city that was not served well.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.420]   There were never enough cabs.
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:15.180]   The way they gave-- they sold the cab medallions.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.220]   It was all this kind of artificial constraint.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.860]   Nobody wanted to change.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.460]   And the fact is, San Francisco's were just tired.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:24.300]   I mean, you could never rely on a taxi in San Francisco.
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.780]   And their taxi savvy people.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.780]   And Uber and Lyft came in.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.940]   And people just embraced it because now they
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.260]   could get a car.
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.340]   So I feel bad for the taxi drivers.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.940]   But this is an example of a market that
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.660]   was being terribly served by traditional taxis.
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.140]   And people got an alternative and took it.
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:44.660]   It's not surprising at all.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.940]   So many cabs now have electronic handling apps similar
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:48.540]   to Uber and Lyft.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.300]   I was in Portland.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.740]   And they have what used to be called taxi magic, which
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.260]   is now called some bumper or something.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.820]   I don't want to have a different app for every second.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.260]   I guess if I live in San Francisco.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:00.380]   But if you're in Portland, you get that app and you use it.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.820]   And that worked great.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.180]   Actually, it worked just as good as something like Uber did.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.940]   But in San Francisco, it's just been a very backward taxi
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.540]   culture.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.660]   Well, this is another example of technology replacing
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.860]   as something that wasn't working.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:19.180]   I feel kind of bad.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:23.140]   The NFL made a deal with Microsoft
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.780]   for saying everybody in the NFL will use surface tablets
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:27.580]   during the games.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.340]   And they use them in all the pre-shows.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.180]   And they have them.
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.700]   You see all the brad shots.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.900]   And they're in these special blue rubber things
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.580]   with-- it says surface on the handle.
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:39.660]   That's like your little loan?
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.380]   Unfortunately, the TV announcer just keep going on my pads.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:47.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.700]   That's a great thing.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.540]   That's a great story.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:50.740]   That should have been in the contract,
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.620]   because the NFL does a deal with the TV networks,
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.820]   and they should have put in the contract.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.820]   If they start doing that, then you're not getting this money.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.940]   They didn't do that.
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.820]   Week one, Fox commentator John Lynch
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.900]   told viewers the New Orleans Saints quarterback
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.900]   Drew Brees was not watching movies on his iPad during a game.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.380]   He said players had iPad-like tools.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.860]   Well, that's a fact.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.500]   Trent Dilfer on Monday Night Football
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.500]   wondered how long it took Cardinals assistant head coach
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.940]   for the summer to learn how to use the iPad.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.860]   And at Sunday's game between San Diego Charger
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.860]   and the Seattle Seahawks, a local television announcer
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:26.060]   balked when told the teams were using service devices.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.420]   What, he said, I thought it was an iPad.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.300]   Well, the problem you're going to run into,
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.180]   if they just keep calling everything an iPad, that's a tablet,
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.820]   is they're good.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.940]   That Apple's going to have to stop them from doing it,
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.420]   because they're going to lose their trademark.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.140]   Goes public domain if you do--
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.780]   And then they all will be I-pleans.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.460]   Yes.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.420]   That's what they'll be called.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.620]   Microsoft paid $400 million to be the official--
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:46.340]   Oh, crap.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.980]   This is what they call it, the official sideline technology
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.140]   of the NFL.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:52.980]   We see the problem right there.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.140]   That's $400 million.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.140]   It's this weird divide, though, where
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.060]   like you can't tell the announcer to use--
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.420]   it's like product placement.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.620]   Like the announcer can say whatever they want.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.700]   They could call it a tablet.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:05.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.020]   They're probably somebody should advise them
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.900]   that those aren't iPads, and they shouldn't say that.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.660]   All the tablet, please.
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:11.140]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.020]   Actually, a lot of people are saying
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.260]   good things about the Surface Pro 3.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.620]   It seems to be selling very well.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.860]   They may have turned it around with a Surface Pro.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:21.060]   I don't know about selling, but I do know that people--
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.060]   Like, it's over my head, too.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.300]   It's sold out in many markets.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:23.980]   It sounds like it's--
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.220]   They bring 10 in 10.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:30.500]   Cleveland, and they sell them out.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.980]   Sold out.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.060]   That was just the shipment for the Browns.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.740]   Yeah, for the football team.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.700]   We see no evidence of this.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.820]   We see no evidence of success.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.860]   We see no evidence of success.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.860]   They've lost a lot of money.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.660]   Where's your Surface?
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.500]   You must have one, because you buy every new income job.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:48.300]   You don't have a Surface.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.900]   You buy everything that comes out.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.100]   Everything.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.540]   I thought about buying one of those Surface Pro's.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.420]   But you don't have a Surface.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:56.940]   When they cut the price to super cheap for the old model,
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:57.860]   I thought about buying one.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.620]   But you didn't.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.380]   I thought about it.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:02.380]   You got 10 iPhones in here, and you got everything else.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:03.580]   You got a Kindle you already had.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.500]   You can assemble all the iPhones into something
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.380]   that's the size of a Surface.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.500]   This amazes me.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.260]   This is where Apple's really strong.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:16.180]   This-- the high end iPhone, the big 5 1/2 inch,
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.460]   if you got the 128 gig version, $950.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.700]   I mean, people will not spend $300 for a PC.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.740]   Oh, that's too expensive.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:27.260]   You got a $250 one?
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.380]   But $950 for a phone.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.100]   That's why their numbers are so high.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.500]   That's why Apple's doing so well.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.900]   That's why it's a giant company.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:34.660]   It's stunning.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:37.140]   But most people don't see the $950.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:37.700]   Right.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.140]   Still buying the contract.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.740]   And so it's what?
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.380]   It's $4.99.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:41.860]   So--
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.340]   Which is still pretty high.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.340]   I got off the subsidized plan last year.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:51.460]   And so this was the first phone I bought, where I no longer
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:53.500]   was on that AT&T plan.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.900]   And I told my wife, well, we're paying $35 a month
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.380]   for the phone I'm going to get.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.500]   And that when it ships, I heard her call from the other room,
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.260]   you paid $850 for this phone?
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.740]   Yeah, those people thought people can do math.
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:11.580]   $35 a month, dear.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.500]   And that's OK, right?
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:13.860]   Yes.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:17.140]   My phone here, this little phone--
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:17.620]   Is this like a--
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:18.420]   Is that why I gave you?
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:18.940]   No, no.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.660]   The one you gave me is--
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.940]   Anyway, this little phone--
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:24.740]   No, someday, I--
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.060]   $30 a month--
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:27.460]   Your brain is going to be in a jar.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.540]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:29.820]   Any minute.
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:31.500]   This 30 bucks a month.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.540]   30 bucks a month with a T-Mobile plan.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.300]   Oh, you have that 100 minute plan?
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:35.940]   It's-- yeah.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:36.860]   That's a great deal.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.180]   Don't talk much on the phone.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.180]   Unlimited text?
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:39.900]   Unlimited text?
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:40.740]   Unlimited data.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.860]   Limited data.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.460]   And 100 minutes.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:43.060]   And 100 minutes.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:43.580]   Phone calls.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:44.460]   For 30 bucks a month.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.700]   And if you do talk too much, because sometimes you travel--
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.060]   Does the phone stop working?
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:51.220]   It tells you to call in and add some money.
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.020]   Because it's a go phone.
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.580]   That's why it's not a regular contract phone.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.420]   It's a month to month.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.180]   So you call them up and tell them I want 10 bucks more
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:58.620]   of talking.
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.180]   And they say, OK, no problem.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:02.260]   And if you don't use the old 10 bucks worth--
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:02.940]   Talk like that?
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.020]   OK, no problem.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.500]   You used to be a taxi dispatch.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.260]   And so when you give them the 10 bucks extra for some more
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.780]   minutes and you have like-- you didn't use only but 8 bucks
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.980]   of it, they put the 2 bucks credit on the 30 for next month.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:19.020]   It's like, why would you do anything else?
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.700]   This is why T-Mobile is the number one carrier in America
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.860]   today.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.740]   Nah, right?
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.580]   No.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:25.100]   Are they?
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:25.940]   I don't know.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:26.740]   They should be.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.660]   They should be.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.060]   I don't think so.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:34.220]   They are the biggest driver of change in a month carriers.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:36.300]   But they're the ones who are kind of forcing the rest
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.860]   of the industry to come along.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:40.260]   I think they're number four around the--
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.180]   Yeah, they're not big.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.860]   But everyone likes working with them.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:45.940]   I love these plans.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.420]   It works.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:48.900]   And they don't steal your money.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:49.540]   That's what I like.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.460]   Yeah, no, I think I like T-Mobile a lot.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.700]   And that's why I was trying to get a T-Mobile phone at the Apple
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.020]   store.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.380]   And they had sold out.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.700]   And even though they lied to me and said it's locked,
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.020]   I know that I can go to a T-Mobile store with a T-Mobile phone
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:03.820]   and they'll unlock it.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   They're not sure what I like.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.420]   Go to with this anyway and put a T-Mobile card in.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.380]   You said so yourself.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:08.900]   You're right.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.740]   Well, I didn't know that.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:10.180]   I had a time.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.180]   That's what I'd want is a Verizon.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.540]   You got CDMA plus GSM.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.340]   That's the phone you want.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:16.940]   I agree.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:17.660]   That is the phone you want.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.140]   Best of both worlds.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.180]   That's what I'm taking to London.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:22.900]   And unless that Moto X calls my name and--
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.180]   --your Hanson's voice.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.980]   And it seems unlikely.
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.620]   Oracle has a new kit.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.060]   I'm sorry, Oculus.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.140]   I have Larry Elson on the brain.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:37.220]   The new Oculus Crescent Bay VR--
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:37.740]   what do you call it?
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.380]   Visor?
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:39.700]   You don't have a visor?
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.300]   It's not a headset.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:41.740]   Helmet.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.220]   Headset.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:43.580]   All right.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:44.620]   Clunky headset.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.220]   Let's get-- it would be more specific.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.140]   Now, 360-degree head tracking.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.540]   So you can look all the way up.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:50.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:50.700]   And all the way down.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.060]   And then throw up.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.100]   And this one looks a little more like a snorkel mask.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:56.140]   And it's got audio.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:58.580]   Look at that little built-in headphones there, huh?
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:58.940]   Yep.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.700]   Now, how much would you pay?
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.860]   I think it'd be funny to put one of these on somebody.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.420]   And I don't know how you'd manage this.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.660]   Maybe you'd drug them.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:06.940]   And then leave them sitting there,
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.860]   and then take their clothes off.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:10.860]   So they don't know.
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.060]   And they can't tell.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:12.620]   They look around.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.180]   They look around.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.020]   They got clothes on.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:14.860]   Yeah, they're looking around.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.900]   And then they take--
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.740]   everyone's standing around a huge group like this,
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.460]   laughing at them.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.380]   I'm just imagining these kinds of scenes.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.740]   When is the Samsung--
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.420]   Samsung made a version of the Oculus.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:26.140]   They're working with Oculus.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.020]   When is the Samsung Gear VR Gear come out?
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:30.660]   Is it soon?
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:32.180]   Did you buy 200 bucks?
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.380]   But you have to have a note.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:35.020]   Is it next year?
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.700]   You have to have a note, which is--
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:38.620]   You have to have a note from your doctor probably.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.460]   Well, they do make me nauseous,
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.500]   so my doctor would probably get involved.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.060]   Oculus strip.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:46.060]   Is this a gimmick?
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:46.900]   I don't think so.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.740]   I think we're not quite all the way there yet.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.700]   It's just early days.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.620]   I think it's-- yeah, and there'll be early adopters.
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.620]   I think for gaming, it's going to be big.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:59.060]   I think it's going to be in either PCs or consoles or both.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.820]   But I do-- the people I've talked to who've used it
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:02.820]   have been blown away by it.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.180]   And they say the latest version is just that much more impressive
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.740]   that it's going to be a really immersive gaming experience.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:12.620]   I don't think we're going to all be like in Neuromancer
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:15.620]   or something where suddenly everybody is in the matrix
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.180]   and we're all seeing things like that.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:18.740]   That's going to be a long time, if ever.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.180]   But as a gaming accessory, yeah, I think it's going to be big.
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.180]   A Japanese company, Obayashi, is going
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.500]   to build a space elevator.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.380]   Should be up and running by 2050.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.220]   Yeah, sure.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.700]   My mind will be in a jar by then.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.060]   Yeah, probably.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.140]   But you could put that jar in an elevator and send it to space.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:37.060]   Send it to the moon.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.700]   Send it to the moon.
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.100]   A lot of science fiction is posited
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:46.060]   that instead of this-- the whole problem of space travel
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.260]   is the Earth's gravity.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:47.980]   When you write these--
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.660]   Do you use the word "posited"?
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.500]   Yeah?
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.620]   Is that an incorrect question?
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.580]   Why would you say "posited" or something like that?
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.100]   Positive.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.020]   Positive.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:56.740]   Isn't that correct?
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.220]   Sounds like leaving a dog--
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.220]   Not deep-pause somewhere.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.780]   That's positive.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:02.660]   I posit.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.220]   Well, I'm just saying, I just pointed this out because--
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.860]   No, no, no, I'm sitting here with three writers.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.300]   I'm not a writer.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.220]   Do you ever use "posited" when you write?
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.020]   Never.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.380]   Never, being honest about it.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.180]   Extremely, rarely.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:16.340]   I'm just trying-- I'm all for you, Leo.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:17.140]   It is a verb.
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.140]   I'm trying to help.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.740]   The forward is a basis of argument.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.140]   As fact, put forward as a basis of argument.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.820]   It's like postulate, advance, propounce,
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.620]   submit, hypothesize, propose, or assert.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.860]   Which would you prefer of those?
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:33.860]   Here, let's play the audio.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:34.340]   I don't know.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:35.260]   Posit.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.300]   Posit.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.420]   Posit.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:37.940]   Posit.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.820]   It just sounds like "deposited."
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.620]   Posit, I have to go into the bathroom.
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.380]   Yeah, positive.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:43.820]   Yes, I am pausing.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.580]   Exposited.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:45.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:49.300]   Now I'll get blamed for taking the show off the track,
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.020]   just by bringing this out.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.740]   All I remember is I was talking about a space elevator.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:53.940]   I think space elevator's--
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.940]   This is bogus.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:57.660]   This is the idea is that the physics totally work.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:02.020]   If you can make a material strong enough to run that cable.
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:04.860]   And even if it's a fusion, right?
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.860]   It's always 30 years away.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:07.860]   And that's actually what they say in this story is,
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:10.260]   we think we can get the nanotube strong enough to do this
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:11.420]   by about 2030.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:14.700]   So really, it's just coming in 15 years.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.860]   All according to Mr. Ishikawa, all you have to do
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:20.740]   is get something 100 times stronger than a steel cable.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.420]   No, it's-- the physics work.
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.300]   No problem.
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:26.020]   The physics work, you drop a cable from space
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:29.300]   and tie it on at the equator somewhere.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.660]   And it's way cheaper than firing off.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.060]   What is it in a bucket?
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.900]   And then raise it up?
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:35.100]   Well, there's--
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.140]   Yeah, you get in a bucket.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.300]   Well, you've done it.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:38.300]   It's counterweighted.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.300]   Something flying around--
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.100]   There's two buckets.
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:40.940]   There's two buckets.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.740]   A couple of thousand kilometers.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:47.100]   Yeah, and for the next five weeks, you're being towed up.
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:47.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.700]   How fast is it?
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:49.900]   Well, it's not going to be very fast.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.340]   Cars powered by magnetic linear motors
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:56.060]   will carry people in cargo to a newly built space station
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.780]   at a fraction of the cost of rockets.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.460]   It will take seven days to get there.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.420]   No problem.
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:02.580]   It's a big deal.
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:05.180]   But super cheap once you build it.
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.300]   Just in space, I guess.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:06.900]   They can do it.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.420]   It cares.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:09.700]   Right now, we can make cables that strong,
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.980]   but we can only make them three centimeters long.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.620]   Yeah, they need to be a little bit longer.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:14.780]   Yeah, well, if you can do it for three--
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:15.780]   it's just a matter of time.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.620]   This is one of those--
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.340]   It's a little tiny space elevator.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.580]   This is one of those things that it's like--
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.300]   Like, if they figure out a way to make this stuff,
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.420]   then they could totally change the technology
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:25.340]   of the 21st century.
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:28.460]   But it's probably more likely than not that they can't.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.460]   But if they could, wow, that would be awesome.
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.700]   Yeah, it cost a space shuttle $22,000 per kilogram,
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.620]   because the rocket fuel is so expensive.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.980]   It's a cake cargo in space.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.980]   For the space elevator, a couple hundred bucks.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:41.340]   Ah, that's the payoff.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.020]   Nothing.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.220]   Of building this facility there.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:43.820]   Nothing.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:45.660]   And why just have one?
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.300]   We should have them all over.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.860]   Yeah, everywhere you can get to take a quick ride.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:50.900]   And where do they imagine the disaster movies?
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:53.420]   Because then they'll crash the space elevator
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:54.380]   and the cable smash.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.460]   And this thing comes from super awesome.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.180]   Falling down and the shammances go.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.260]   It's out the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:58.900]   Well, always done.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:01.340]   And because once you've got the disaster move for that,
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:01.820]   yeah, it's already--
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:05.180]   Once you're up there, then it's cheap to go fly around.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:06.660]   Yeah, because you're in space then.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.940]   There's no gravity well.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:10.820]   You just-- you know, you could take a can of Pam or--
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:11.820]   Yeah, Pam.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.660]   That's what we needed space.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:16.220]   It's good for the environment to space Pam and the answers.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.620]   And when your brain's in the jar,
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.100]   it'll be a lot less weight for that Pam.
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:21.100]   I like Pam.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.100]   The Pam rocket.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.100]   The pam rocket.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.100]   Yeah, it's exactly.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.100]   I'm going to the moon.
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:26.100]   See you later.
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.260]   Have a match in the pam.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.500]   Then you get a little thrust off of that.
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.540]   It's good physics.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.900]   No, for that, you want to use final net hairspray.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.740]   That would work.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.740]   Very good.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:37.340]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.420]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:40.860]   Someone's been watching "Gravity."
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.580]   That was a good movie.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.060]   What?
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:43.420]   Gravity.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:44.220]   I like gravity.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.340]   Yeah, I love that movie.
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:47.540]   I like gravity, but I didn't like the movie.
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.420]   You like the fundamental force of nature?
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:52.420]   Yeah, I'm with you on that, John.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:53.420]   We all get--
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.660]   That's how I keep all my stuff together.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.140]   That's how you keep your brain in the jar.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.780]   Otherwise, we'll just float away.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:02.300]   Our show today is brought to you by Audible.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.460]   Love Audible Books.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.180]   Of course, first thing I put on the new iPhone,
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.860]   the Audible app, put it on every phone, sign in.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.500]   All the books I've ever listened to on Audible
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.820]   since the year 2000.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.500]   Mike Elgin and I were having a battle over
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.740]   who joined Audible first.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.340]   And it's very close.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.820]   We both joined in the year 2000.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.860]   But I think I joined in February 2000.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.580]   And he joined in March or April.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.780]   It was that close.
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:28.380]   Audible has over 100,000, 150,000 now.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:30.260]   Books in its library.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.660]   I just finished Graham Nash's biography,
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:35.380]   autobiography, "Wild Tales About His Rock and Roll Life."
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.100]   Quite enjoyed that.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.740]   My next one, and everybody's been saying,
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:42.620]   get to it soon as WTF at Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:43.660]   Have you read that yet?
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.420]   Because I hear really good things about it.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.740]   The story of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.980]   sounds like something ripped from today's headlines.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:57.740]   Well, let me-- I'll tell you what.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:59.900]   This is David Shafer's new novel.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.860]   The committee, an international cabal
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:05.220]   of industrialists and media barons,
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.740]   is on the verge of privatizing all information.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.660]   Dear diary, and an idealistic online underground
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.580]   stands in the way of that takeover
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.340]   using radical politics, classic spycraft,
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:21.540]   and technology that makes big data looked like dial-up.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.540]   Sounds really good.
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:23.020]   It's a techno thriller.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.020]   It's a techno thriller.
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:24.180]   Nice.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:25.500]   Exactly what it is.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.420]   Now, here's the reason I mentioned these books
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:30.780]   is because you can get two books free right now.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:34.580]   A lot of us have been raving about the great new novel
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.100]   from Mark Grissinovich.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.940]   He is at Microsoft.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:40.020]   In fact, he's the kind of the guy who
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:42.580]   is responsible for Azure at Microsoft.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:45.380]   He did the incredible Sis internals.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:48.700]   Microsoft bought them, hired him, and got him writing his books,
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.980]   Zero Day Trojan Horse and Rogue Coder.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:54.300]   Great, because they, again, are ripped from the headlines.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.780]   They're about hackers.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:01.340]   In Rogue Coder, Mark Grissinovich talks-- actually,
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:03.860]   about high frequency trading.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:08.060]   And hackers who get code into the stock market--
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:09.500]   it's just, I can't wait to read it.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:10.540]   Are you an honorable listener, right?
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.340]   Yeah, so I want--
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:11.980]   What's your book?
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.900]   Nexus, since you mentioned Microsoft,
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.500]   and Ramesh Nam, who used to work at Microsoft, I believe.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.940]   And he's got a great series that starts with a book called
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:22.140]   Nexus, which is about what, if you could implant,
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.940]   basically code your brain to be an operating system.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:30.420]   And what would happen when you can start hacking your brain
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:31.500]   and other people's brains?
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.540]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:33.620]   It's a pretty awesome book.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.780]   Great speculation.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:35.220]   You liked it.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:35.860]   Yeah, very good.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.580]   You've got great sci-fi recommendations.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.660]   And it's got the ups and the downs of that technology
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.900]   and how it would affect people on the government
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:44.140]   once to control it, and really good stuff
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.140]   from somebody who is from the tech industry.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.700]   And is also really--
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.220]   Well, that's why I like percent of his books.
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:49.820]   Exactly, same thing.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:50.820]   They're so accurate.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.540]   You know this is all true.
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.060]   I'll tell you what, there's an infinite amount
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:55.820]   of great material.
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.220]   Well, not quite, in 150,000 titles,
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.420]   more than you could ever listen to in a lifetime.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.060]   Classics, like the Heart of Darkness,
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:07.460]   read by Kenneth Branagh, the Legends of King Arthur
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:11.060]   and his knights, Robert Louis Stevenson.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.020]   There's all sorts of great stuff.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.020]   And of course, modern novels, all the big novelists,
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:17.340]   novels come out in audiobooks, same day and date
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:22.780]   as the books come out on the bookstore shelves,
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.100]   the new Jonathan Kellermann novels
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:28.300]   come in soon, the golem of Hollywood.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.500]   I think the thing to do is to go to audible.com.
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:32.740]   Oh, Peter Thiel has a new book.
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.420]   Actually, I've been reading excerpts of this.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.980]   He says speeches from Stanford.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:37.340]   It says speeches, OK.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:39.220]   Zero to one, notes on startups are
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:40.140]   how to build the future.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.780]   Peter Thiel, of course, the man most famous for funding Facebook
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:45.300]   right in the earliest days.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.580]   But he's a very successful--
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.980]   Is he an angel?
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.860]   He was the guy that died on the--
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.140]   Yeah, so it could be allyshive.
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:55.060]   That character was--
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:55.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:57.420]   He was supposed to be Peter Thiel, yeah.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.340]   This would be really great.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.380]   So these are speeches that he gave or a talk he gave.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.340]   He was a guest lecturer.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:06.220]   Oh, so there were lectures.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:07.300]   It was four hours and 15 minutes.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.260]   There was a good amount.
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.060]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.020]   You can get two books free.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.100]   We're going to send you to audible.com/twit
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:19.100]   and the number two, audible.com/twit2, all one word.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.620]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.300]   That's a subscription plan that gives you two books a month.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.660]   You also get the daily digest of the New York Times
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:27.620]   or the Wall Street Journal as part of your subscription.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.380]   That's awesome.
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:30.340]   But the first month's free.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:33.900]   So you get two credits and get two books
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.340]   and cancel any time in the first 30 days.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.220]   Pay nothing with those books.
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.740]   It will always be yours in your library.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.740]   I think you're going to stick around.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:43.580]   There's so many great things to read and learn and enjoy.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:46.980]   If you've got to commute, if you go to the gym,
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.860]   if you walk the dog or do the dishes,
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:50.580]   there's nothing like it.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:54.940]   Audible.com/twit2 and get started listening today.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.060]   I think you're going to like it.
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.820]   Two books free.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.260]   You've heard us talk about it.
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.060]   Do it.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.020]   Don't put it off any longer.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:05.900]   How Google works by Eric Schmidt.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.460]   You should know.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460]   You should.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.460]   This isn't out yet.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.460]   You should get through this again.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.460]   Yeah, but this is out.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:14.100]   This is coming out in a couple of, like, two days.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.100]   Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.780]   He does all his writing.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:17.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:21.300]   Alan Eagle, Google Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO,
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.900]   Eric Schmidt, and former SVP of Products, Jonathan Rosenberg,
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:28.500]   came to Google over a decade ago.
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:33.180]   So this is how they put together that first decade at Google.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:35.540]   That's interesting.
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.540]   Joan Rivers.
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.540]   I hate everyone starting with me.
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:40.820]   She wasn't too bitter.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.820]   Good stuff here.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.780]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:47.860]   So pass this along to your friend, Adam Curry, and Vidi is new,
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:52.300]   GPU proves there really was a moon landing.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.780]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:55.100]   Well, I don't know what I am either.
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:56.100]   Let's see here.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:00.740]   It says, "Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, there's still some people who
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:06.380]   believe that the moon landing was a hoax, a TV drama, produced by Stanley
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.940]   Kubrick and presented his fact to dupe the Soviet Union giving up the space race."
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:11.940]   Huh.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.740]   I never knew this.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:16.300]   What does Adam think?
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:17.300]   I don't know.
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:18.300]   All right.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:19.300]   I'm going to ask him.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.300]   You should bring him on the show.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.300]   No, I asked him.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.300]   I asked him.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.300]   It didn't go well.
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.300]   Well, I was because you voted him.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.300]   You hated him.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:26.300]   I didn't go to him.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.300]   I asked him.
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:28.300]   You would hate him as obvious.
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:29.540]   Very obvious to me.
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:32.860]   This deliciously ludicrous conspiracy theory, I guess in gadget.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.860]   Is that what it says?
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.860]   Deliciously?
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:36.860]   What a writing is that.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.420]   But now it's advocates.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.420]   Well, it's delicious.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.420]   It was tasty.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:42.900]   Now it's advocates have one more refutation and I.
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:50.780]   NVIDIA's voxel global illumination tech demo, a GPU powered recreation of the Apollo 11
[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   landing site that uses dynamic lighting technology to address common claims of moon
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.780]   deniers.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:01.020]   This is a publicity stunt for NVIDIA.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.420]   It seems like a bit of a paper tiger.
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.140]   They're jousting at.
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:06.140]   And you joust at paper tigers.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:08.500]   And those people are just going to say, well, that's what they want you to think.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:09.900]   Hey, Jason, yeah, you haven't been.
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:13.140]   You go work on YWTC seven fell down.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.620]   That would be more contemporary.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:15.620]   I know.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.620]   Makes that sense.
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:21.860]   It would collapse at gravity speeds.
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:27.500]   3D rendition of a photograph showing Buzz Aldrin descending a ladder to the moon's surface.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.700]   They show that the light is exactly right and so forth.
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:31.700]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:32.700]   It is.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.700]   It's a publicity stunt.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:38.620]   That's one of my favorite videos is the one of Buzz Aldrin punching some guy out who was
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:41.660]   telling him that the moon landing wasn't real.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:45.180]   Well, that's exactly what you'd expect if he was lying about the whole thing.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:46.740]   He'd hit the guy exactly.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.580]   Yeah, it's proves it.
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:53.380]   But my mocking just a poor innocent public.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:54.380]   Buzz Aldrin there.
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:55.380]   There's there.
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.180]   There's the real one and there's a simulation.
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:58.220]   It's actually the opposite.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220]   This one is a simulation.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:01.300]   And this one's what that's that's my point.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.980]   You can't tell the difference.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.980]   Amazing simulation.
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:04.980]   It's almost point.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:08.020]   I actually know it says it and the video it's actually flipped.
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:09.580]   No, the on the description down here.
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:10.820]   It says it's the same size.
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.460]   It's really hard to tell.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.180]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:15.900]   Oh, no, no, right.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:16.900]   Which one's right, which was left.
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:17.900]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:22.100]   I'm just like an internet retailers are facing new rules from the Federal Trade Commission
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.740]   requiring them.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:24.740]   This is important.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:30.180]   You should know this to ship your order on time or order or offer a refund.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:34.340]   Online sellers are going to be required to ship merchandise within 30 days of price.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.340]   I didn't know that they weren't.
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.340]   30 days.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.860]   Within 30 days of purchase or else give you the option for a refund.
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:39.860]   It's nothing new.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.900]   Apparently not.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:45.940]   The rule prohibits sellers from soliciting mail internet or telephone order sales unless
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:50.540]   they have a reasonable basis to expect they can ship the ordered merchandise within the
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:51.540]   time stated.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:59.140]   You know that this affects somebody like coin who raised a lot of money at $55 a pop for
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.500]   a that charge card that you could pre program and they still haven't shipped it.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:06.620]   They were supposed to ship it this summer and if they say no, that wasn't.
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.300]   That was a that was that was not merchandise.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.300]   That's raising money.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.300]   Yeah, it's different.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.820]   It's not selling something.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:15.540]   I think a lot of people who paid 55 bucks thought they were going to get a coin.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.340]   Well, they still might and they still might.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.340]   All right.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.340]   But not within.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:20.340]   Yeah, this doesn't seem to affect that.
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:21.340]   This is not that.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.340]   No, it's not.
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:23.340]   It's not a purchase.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.340]   So, okay.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:25.540]   So you're right, John.
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:30.300]   This is has been a rule, but only for companies that sell merchandise through catalogs and
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:33.420]   then telephone sales that did not extend to the internet and now does.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.420]   So that's what's new.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:39.500]   Oh, which is to take the old law and make it a wide internet and internet makes it with
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:42.300]   it and tip and cool.
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.020]   I think we're done for the day.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:46.180]   I thank you so much.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:48.900]   Tell us we didn't talk at all about Mac world.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:50.060]   We just kind of mentioned it.
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.060]   Tell us what happened.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:53.220]   Oh, well, a bunch of us.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:57.060]   I've been thinking of leaving for a while and it turns out that there was a, the timing
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:00.420]   was, was such that I left along with many of my colleagues.
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:01.420]   They laid off a bunch of people.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:04.340]   IDG actually in general laid off a bunch of people.
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.340]   Why?
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:06.340]   You'd have to ask them.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.340]   I'm not sure.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.340]   Oh, come on.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.340]   There's gossip.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:10.340]   He doesn't want to speak for that.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.340]   Well, I mean, I don't, he's not working for a name.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.340]   Why?
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:14.500]   I don't, I don't know if I can profess to understand the reason this time.
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:15.980]   This is the, the latest in this series.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:17.620]   Well, there's no question that print magazine.
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.620]   Sure.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:19.620]   You were editor in chief of Mac world.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:21.380]   You were at IDG for 17 years.
[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:22.380]   Yep.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:26.660]   I think it's more complicated than anyone reason, but you know, and, and honestly, the founder
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:30.780]   and owner of IDG passed away earlier this year and he had a really soft spot for the
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:31.780]   media and Pat McGovern.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:32.780]   Pat McGovern, yeah.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:33.780]   I didn't know he passed away.
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.780]   Six months ago.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.900]   And so, and so, you know, the people in charge now do not have the same priorities.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:44.180]   They have different priorities and I think they're funding his foundation.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:45.180]   And so what happens to you?
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:46.180]   What happens to Mac world expo?
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.340]   I don't know the answer.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:51.660]   That's a run by a separate part of IDG and I haven't heard what they're, they're continuing
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660]   to do that or not.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:55.420]   They haven't announced that PC world has stopped, stopped publishing.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.700]   So what happened to Mac world magazine is that it went out of print just like PC world
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:55:59.700]   did last year.
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:01.780]   They're still going to do a digital edition on the iPad.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:03.980]   So if I go to Macworld.com, oh, there'll be an iPad.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.700]   And Macworld.com and PC world.com are still there and tech hive and green bot.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:08.700]   They're all still there.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:12.100]   But, but the staff, the staff is much smaller than it used to be.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.100]   Yes.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:14.100]   Tech hive was yours.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.100]   Baby.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.900]   It was a little painful that happened the day after apples iPhone announced.
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:23.780]   So, the day people have portrayed that as being sort of a calculated thing about Macworld.
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:25.340]   Gold-blooded is the way we've seen.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.140]   But well, I mean, laying people off, you can judge that however you like.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:34.300]   I'd say those layoffs happened across IDG everywhere in the US and that's the date they,
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.300]   that's the date they picked.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:36.860]   It wasn't tied to just Macworld.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:37.860]   So, well, no.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:44.460]   And in fact, you know, there will be, we, we, I think here October 25, 21st, a new Apple
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:45.460]   announcement.
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:46.460]   I hope so.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.940]   Those guys won't be there to, to cover that.
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:48.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:51.460]   So, there are a lot of great people that I work with at Macworld.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:55.220]   I've been planning my next move for a while now, but a lot of great people I work with
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:58.060]   there who are no longer there and hopefully will be finding great new things to do.
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.980]   I was really glad to hear Serenity Caldwell went to go to work for a rich.
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:01.980]   Yeah, she was leaving.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.700]   Actually, before this was announced, she was, she decided she was leaving.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:06.380]   I would just have a tech TV.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.060]   People started seeing the writing on the wall before the actual.
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:10.060]   That's exactly right.
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.700]   Sale and they, they started looking for work earlier.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.220]   Chris Breen, what's it?
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.700]   Chris Breen's still a, still at IDG.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.700]   He's still there.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:17.700]   He's still there.
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.700]   Good.
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:22.740]   And Dan Moore, why don't you put him on the network?
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.420]   Well Dan Moore and actually is working already with Jason on a podcast.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:27.420]   You guys do it.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:28.420]   Yeah, we've got a, we've got a podcast.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.420]   You got the incomparable.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:33.860]   You have a new website called six colors aptly named the Apple colors.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:34.860]   Right.
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:35.860]   Exactly.
[01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:36.860]   Six colors.
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:39.780]   And is it going to just be you on this, but this, you already do in reporting.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:44.700]   This is, this is just me for now with some guest stars since I've got a lot of friends
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:48.900]   who are good writers who are currently without a place to write.
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:53.420]   And over time, who knows if it can grow and be a place that I can have other writers,
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.420]   then that'll be great too.
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:58:00.500]   Well, I remember very well when I got my first Mac in 1984, there was a, a blowing card
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:05.140]   for a new magazine called Macworld.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:06.340]   Might have even included the magazine.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.700]   I'm trying to remember and I've read Macworld ever since since 1984.
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.700]   So it is.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:12.700]   It is.
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:13.700]   It's the end of an era.
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.700]   I'm getting those.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:18.340]   There was a time when I wrote this piece that you're looking at right now for the Verge.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:21.180]   You know, I tried, I tried to mention there was a time when there were no tech blogs.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.180]   There was no website.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.180]   So you learn.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:28.980]   And you know, products would get announced in six weeks, two months later, you would,
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.620]   you would hear about them and you'd pour over every page of the magazines because that's
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:35.500]   all the information that we got about new technology.
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.500]   I did it.
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:37.500]   Absolutely.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:42.100]   My first job was at Mac user magazine where the back page column, this was this cranky
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.660]   guy named John C. de Vorac.
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:44.660]   So it's been all.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.660]   He was the right.
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.660]   He was the anti anti-aditor.
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:50.580]   I was hired for the specific purpose of being a troublemaker.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:51.580]   Yes.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.580]   And you did a great job at that.
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:53.580]   Yes.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:54.580]   Well, that was the idea.
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:55.580]   You can see.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:56.580]   That was a good choice.
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:57.580]   You hate me.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:58.580]   Wow.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:00.620]   These guys hold a grudge.
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.980]   Is there anybody, anybody printing computer magazines?
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:07.660]   Future is still printing Mac addict or Mac life, although it's done out.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:11.260]   I believe largely done out of their UK offices now that people do Mac format.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:13.140]   I think in England you can find them.
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.620]   In other parts of the world there are.
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:17.860]   But here in the States we just don't read paper magazines.
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:22.580]   Well, there's still lots of paper magazines out there, but I think as tech magazines go,
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:24.620]   the rest of the industry follows.
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:27.780]   Because those are the cutting edge.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:31.820]   Those readers are a little head of everybody else on technology.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.460]   And the rest of them will get there.
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:36.380]   I have to say I haven't got a paper newspaper in three years.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:39.220]   I get the New Yorker, but I don't get the paper New Yorker.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:40.220]   I get the description.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:46.860]   And I just remember why I didn't take these subscriptions because I ended up with piles
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:47.860]   and piles of paper.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:51.100]   You can bring it next time because the only bad thing about not subscribing to the newspaper
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.060]   is I can't start my barbecue anymore.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:54.060]   Fish wrap.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:57.260]   So I really need to hurt my soul.
[01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:01.420]   Well, of course Dwight Silverman, who is an inked stained red from way back, why not
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.420]   the Houston Chronicle?
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:04.460]   But even the Chronicles gone through changes.
[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:06.460]   And even your role there has changed, Dwight.
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.460]   Yes.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.580]   And increasingly we're online.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:16.380]   But what's interesting about at least in Houston because the economy is so good, we're actually
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.380]   doing pretty well.
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:20.980]   We may be an unusual case for newspapers.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:25.500]   Actually, the one category that still seems to print magazines is gaming.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.420]   Aren't there a couple of gaming magazines to nail?
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.820]   Oh, and also it's kind of like Mitch.
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:30.420]   I think like high end isn't.
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:32.580]   I think there are some inner prices.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:33.580]   Yeah.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.660]   Because actually a lot of the old school enterprise guys would rather get it, I think, on print
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.660]   than--
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:42.420]   Yeah, that way they can have their feet up on their desk and have the print thing in front
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.300]   so nobody knows they're sleeping.
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:45.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.300]   I can't do that.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.940]   Well, it's the end of an era.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:51.860]   And Jason, I'm so glad you live nearby and we expect to see a lot more of you here because
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:52.860]   I think you'll have some free time.
[02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:53.860]   Can you drive on it?
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.860]   I love being here.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:55.860]   Where did you move to?
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:56.860]   Oh, I've been living.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   I live in Marin, I live in Mill Valley.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.860]   Oh, in the middle of Allee.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:00.860]   Oh, just a short drive.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:01.860]   I don't have to cross a bridge or anything.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:02.860]   So if there's an earthquake, I can still get here.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:05.660]   You know, I was talking to Jason Heiner at Tech Republic.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:08.780]   He's writing a book about media and startups.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:11.380]   And it was very kind like I think it was going to include me in the book.
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:13.380]   And we were talking about my history.
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:14.380]   Your history.
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:19.500]   Starting with you back at K&BR in the '19 early '90s.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.260]   And I started talking about computers and you very kindly gave me some credibility by
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.260]   letting--
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:26.260]   By hanging out.
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:29.420]   Well, by just letting me answer some questions, some cute peer questions as they came up.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:30.660]   You were a tech nerd.
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.460]   You're much more so than than now.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.460]   Now you're just a phone guy.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:36.620]   I never wanted to be a phone guy, believe me.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:39.580]   But it seems like he was a priest and children's much anymore.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:40.940]   Who would have figured that out.
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:41.940]   But I thought that.
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:45.100]   But you-- and at the time, I think you were writing a column a day.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:46.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.100]   I've gone through different phases of writing a column.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:49.100]   A column a day.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.780]   Not for any one pre-radical, but for a bunch of them.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:52.780]   Yeah, I had all of them.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:55.780]   You were in every--
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:56.780]   Yeah, I was all over the place.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.780]   I think I called you the world's most prolific computer writer.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:58.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:01:59.980]   You should be surprised.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:00.980]   It's not that--
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.420]   You still write it all?
[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:04.140]   Yeah, I write for a PC magazine.
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:05.620]   I do a little writing for Gina.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:08.700]   For last year, I was writing for a PC magazine on a daily basis.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:13.060]   I write for the online, and then they have a tablet version of the magazine, which is
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.060]   different.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.060]   How's PC Magazine doing online?
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:16.820]   I mean, it's not as big as it used to be.
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.820]   No, of course not.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:18.820]   When it had a print.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:19.820]   I think it's competitive online.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:20.820]   I think it's competitive online.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:21.820]   Is it?
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:22.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:23.820]   Is it for anybody else?
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:24.820]   So it's possible to make stories.
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:25.820]   Make revenue doing it.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:26.820]   PC World has a lot of traffic, too.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:27.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:28.820]   It's on the web.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.820]   And honestly--
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:30.820]   CIVE is great.
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.340]   As I left IDG, I mean, we were so focused on the web.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.220]   It was funny that the story was "Macworld print" is shutting down, because the fact is
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.100]   the editors have been focused on the website for years now.
[02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:43.220]   And the print magazine was always a best of the website compilation every month.
[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:44.220]   But it's still sad.
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:46.060]   Well, I'm so glad to have you here.
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:47.500]   And we'll see more of you.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:48.980]   And people should go to Six Colors.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:50.220]   Did you just move to Marin?
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:51.220]   What's the deal?
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:52.220]   No, no.
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.220]   I've lived in Marin since '99.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:54.220]   A long time.
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.220]   It comes up a lot.
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.220]   Six Colors.
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:57.220]   I'm checking out.
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:58.220]   I'm checking out.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:02:59.220]   Let's just figure you'll have more time now.
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:01.220]   I'm not commuting into San Francisco anymore.
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:03.540]   But it's show on the thing.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.100]   It's a distribution network.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:06.100]   It's technical.
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.100]   Put the show on the thing.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.100]   Put the show on the thing.
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:13.580]   Put your mind in the jar and put your troubles at ease, because the world is moving into it.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.580]   All right, moving into it.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.580]   We're taking down here.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:16.580]   We're taking down here.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.580]   We're taking down here.
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.580]   Any day now.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:19.580]   Or you should go to the world.
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:20.580]   I'm going to have a list of cars from here today.
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.580]   Channeldevorect.org.com.
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:23.580]   Channeldevorect.com.
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:24.580]   The No Agenda Show.
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:25.580]   No Agenda Show.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.580]   Try to bring the site down.
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:29.580]   It's square space.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.580]   And we never bring it down.
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.140]   We're talking about all kinds of stuff.
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:34.620]   Good to see you once again.
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.820]   Always a pleasure, Leo.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.980]   That was so insincere, I thought.
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:40.980]   No, wasn't.
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:44.020]   You really should attempt to be more sincere, I think.
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:46.300]   And Mr. Dwight Silverman, always a pleasure to have you.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.180]   I'm glad things are going well at the cron.
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:51.940]   And, man, if you live closer, I'd like to have you in here, too, more often.
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:56.660]   Well, I think sometimes I think I may just say the hell with it and fly out there and
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.660]   break into the studio.
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:58.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:03.300]   I think the last time we pressed the flesh was in 2010 at the iPad.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.300]   It was the iPad.
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:06.660]   It was the first time I've been launched.
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:07.660]   It's been a while.
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:08.660]   It's been too long.
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:09.660]   So I need to get out there.
[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:14.500]   It used to be because of CES and Comdex and people who get together a few times a year.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:15.980]   Oh, yeah, it's more social than today.
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:18.740]   Not anymore, it was in their own little tech hive.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:19.740]   Right.
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:20.740]   Right.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:21.740]   Our brains are in jars.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.740]   That's the...
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:24.340]   Oh, just a bunch of brains in a jar.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:28.640]   Hey, we do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2 p.m.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640]   2,200 UTC.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:33.880]   Once again, a reminder that next week will be an hour earlier because I'm going to try
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:37.340]   to get out of here and fly to London shortly after the show.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.340]   I will not miss a show, though.
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:39.340]   On a jet.
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:41.040]   I'll be back before the next twit.
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.240]   On a first class, right?
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.040]   Upper class, we call it.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:46.840]   I'm on Virgin at London.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.840]   Virgin upper class.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:49.600]   Do you have to sing and dance like they used to do?
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.600]   Remember that?
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.600]   What?
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:53.200]   You used to have sing and dance.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.840]   You get a free ticket and get an upper class.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.840]   To get on the plane?
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.640]   If you were like, you know, you're a clapton.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:58.640]   Oh.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.920]   Virgin Atlantic.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.320]   I want to fly with you.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:04.320]   Something like that?
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.320]   I don't think that's going to get me a ticket.
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.320]   2 p.m.
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.320]   I'll be starting.
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.080]   And I do invite you all to join us live.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:16.000]   But if you can't, we got on-demand audio and video after the fact every week at twit.tv
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.760]   and wherever better podcasts are aggregated.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.320]   Look for iTunes and that kind of thing.
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:23.240]   I posit you will be back.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.240]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:25.240]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:27.040]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.040]   Thank you.
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.040]   Thank you.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:29.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:30.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:32.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:35.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:36.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.040]   [Applause]
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.540]   - Quit, baby.
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.400]   Do as a Twitter, alright.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.900]   Do as a Twitter, baby.
