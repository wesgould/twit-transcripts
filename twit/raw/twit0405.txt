[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   It's time for Twit this weekend.
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.080]   Tech Ryan Block from GDGT joins us along with
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880]   Cedric IngrÃ³n and Patrick Bejoff from France.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880]   We're going to talk about the latest from Google.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.380]   What's Google I/O going to bring?
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.240]   We'll find out.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.480]   Adobe's decided to stop selling software,
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.980]   only sell it by subscription, and YouTube
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.280]   has some new paid channels.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.180]   What does that all mean?
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.320]   We'll talk about it this week on Tech.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   In--
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   Ha ha, no!
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.820]   [APPLAUSE]

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.020]   It's time for Twit this week in--
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.820]   hey, hello, everybody.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.580]   Welcome to the show.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.860]   We've got a great panel for you.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.260]   The French invasion has begun.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.580]   Sitting next to me from Planet Crenne, an LCI TV,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.180]   their technology editor, Cedric Engrintz.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.420]   Can I say it French?
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.100]   Cedric?
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.620]   Cedric?
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.340]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.420]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.420]   How do you say, "brickhouse"?
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.300]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.700]   To "brick the twit."
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.860]   The French are coming.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.260]   It's great to have you back, Cedric.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.860]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.820]   Also with us from Paris.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.700]   It's Patrick Bejah.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.820]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.060]   Patrick, who is the most famous French podcaster in the world.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.820]   Absolutely.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.380]   Patrickbejah.com and does about 800 podcasts, some
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.980]   in French, some in English.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.420]   Nice to have you.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.940]   Thank you.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.980]   Welcome back.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.060]   And then Ryan, it's just you and me on the other side.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.380]   But hey, it's great to have you.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.620]   Ryan Block, formerly at Gadget, I guess you're still
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.180]   a gadget, founder of Gadget.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.700]   But you're also editor emeritus now at end gadget,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.860]   because congratulations.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.340]   AOL acquired you.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.620]   Thanks.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.740]   Yeah, it was a couple months ago.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.540]   Technically, I never really gave that title up.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.340]   I just never really used it either.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.300]   So now I have to get the word out
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.340]   that I'm working on a gadget stuff.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.660]   All editor emeritus means is used to be editor,
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.460]   but that actually has some import.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.260]   Yeah, it's like an honorary editorial title.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.060]   Are you going to write it?
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.860]   I did occasionally contribute stuff.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220]   So you'll still write a little bit?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.780]   Yeah, I've got a piece that I'm working on that'll have up
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.100]   in the next, I think, one to two weeks.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.260]   It was about taking a road trip in a Tesla model
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.380]   last time in Southern California.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.580]   And it was better weather.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.140]   Yeah, you survived.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.580]   And Gadget, how is that going to change with the AOL acquisition?
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.780]   It's kind of to be determined.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.580]   I think more than anything specific to Gadget,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.620]   AOL acquired us because we have some know-how around some kind
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.100]   of key areas in the media space that they want us to help
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.940]   kind of beef up.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.420]   And I think they have the right DNA receptors for what we do.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.180]   So, yeah, I mean, if Gadget is around for a couple more years,
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060]   that would be a surprise if Gadget eventually gets
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.500]   folded into end Gadget.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.780]   It wouldn't be a surprise either.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.940]   We're just going to kind of figure it out as we go
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.860]   and do the best thing for both communities.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.220]   Yeah, you pivoted a little bit with Gadget and made it really
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.500]   more about products and kind of rotten tomatoes for products
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.860]   where you get reviews from real people and the critics'
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.620]   reviews and you have a score.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.460]   And that does fit very well with what Gadget is doing.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.860]   They're doing more of the longer-form stuff, articles,
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.780]   and so forth.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.220]   So it seems like there's a natural pairing, actually.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.660]   Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you see us starting
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.900]   to apply that model to some other verticals as well over time.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.820]   It's worked pretty well.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.180]   It's unique and it's like, you know, we don't want to be noisy
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.660]   and there are plenty of sites out there to, you know,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.460]   do original product reviews and stuff like that.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.300]   And, you know, we find ways to add value that are not kind
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.060]   of in that exact same format.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060]   Well, congratulations.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   Thanks.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.620]   You know, I mean, you left AOL, you left in Gadget.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.100]   Is it a little weird coming back?
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.580]   Are you happy to be back?
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.460]   Well, you're going to say you're happy because it'd
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.900]   be imprudent to say otherwise in the politics.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.740]   I would be honest.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.580]   I'm actually having a lot of fun.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.620]   It is a very different company.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.140]   It's like it is like literally a completely different company
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.820]   that just happens to have the same name from when I left.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.700]   It literally could not be any different from the inside out.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   It's still a big company.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.860]   It's still a big internet company.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.340]   And, you know, they're still figuring a lot of stuff out.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.900]   But I'm actually really stoked to be able to kind of help them
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.300]   figure some of these things out.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.220]   Must be fun.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.380]   It's nice to have a big budget to spend.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.340]   Well, I don't know how big my budget is right now.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.940]   But spend a very honest money.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.500]   So we're getting ready for Google I/O. I presume--
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.100]   I know Cedric's in town for that.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.820]   And I presume you're going to be going to that, Ryan.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.260]   I will be there for a little bit.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.740]   We'll be there covering-- what we're
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.100]   going to do on Wednesday, which is thank goodness
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.460]   Google decided to consolidate what
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.900]   was three keynotes into a single keynote
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.140]   that we can actually cover.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.180]   Three hours.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.900]   It'll be long.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.020]   It starts at 9, right?
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.060]   And it'll go to noon.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.180]   And we'll cover it live here from the studio with Tom Merritt
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.060]   and Sarah Lane and I as actor.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.740]   And then Gina, Trappani, and Jeff Jarvis,
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.220]   and I will be at the keynote.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.420]   And then we're going to drive back quickly after the keynote.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.580]   And we'll do this week in Google shortly after to kind of analyze it.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.540]   Unfortunately, I think Google might have made a mistake,
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.180]   because in previous Google I/Os, this
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.820]   is their big developer conference.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.220]   They gave away a ton of stuff.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.780]   They gave away almost $1,200 worth of stuff last time.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.140]   And the focus now on Google I/O is all about, well, what
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.820]   are we going to get, at least for the press,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.660]   maybe not for the developers.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.980]   But it seems to be, instead of what's Google going to announce,
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.300]   we know they're going to talk about glass.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.060]   We know they're going to talk about the next generation
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.420]   of Android, which is probably just not Keyline Pie,
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.340]   but just another Jelly Bean update.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.820]   We know they'll probably--
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.700]   I hope they'll talk about Google TV and Android and tablets.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.020]   But mostly people want to play the game.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.300]   What are we going to get under our chairs?
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.780]   Well, they're going to get an excellent seminar.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.260]   It's a mistake, isn't it a free publicity?
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.500]   They're probably going to give away Nexus 7s,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.780]   the new version of Nexus 7.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.700]   And instantly, the whole world is going
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.940]   to know that there's a new, better, cooler version
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.540]   of the thing.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.140]   So I don't know if it's really a mistake.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.620]   It would probably be a mistake if they didn't have anything
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.100]   to give away.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.220]   Well, at this point, that's unlikely to happen anytime soon.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.540]   We got a queue last year.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.780]   That's a nice collector's item, paperweight.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.140]   What a beautiful one.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.060]   Beautiful paperweight.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.180]   Heavy, wonderful.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.340]   What else do you think we'll see?
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.260]   There's been some rumor.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.500]   And I think they need to.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.660]   The Nexus 4 came out late last year.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.380]   It's not old.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.860]   It's not ready to be replaced.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.860]   But when you look at the high-end Android phones today,
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700]   the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One, it doesn't look like it's
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.780]   quite up to that.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.900]   Doesn't have LTE.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.860]   Would we perhaps see a new developer phone from Google
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.020]   and Nexus--
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.940]   well, the rumor is X?
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.860]   It wouldn't make sense.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.540]   I mean, they've waited so long before actually having Motorola
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.500]   come out with a Nexus--
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.540]   It's time for Motorola.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.660]   It's time to step up.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.300]   Absolutely.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.100]   And they can't really announce one
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.700]   without releasing it.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.060]   So it would make perfect sense for--
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.180]   and it would be a real comeback for Motorola,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.740]   who actually needs this.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.060]   But among the rumors, I read something
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.900]   about a Nexus 11-inch tablet from Samsung.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.420]   Ooh.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.460]   That would make sense as well.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.700]   And of course, we need to know more about the glasses,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.540]   although even Robert Scobel last week said, no, no, no.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.980]   There's no way they're releasing the actual glasses this year.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.620]   They'll talk about it.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.580]   But--
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.260]   Eric Schmidt kind of let that leak a couple of months ago.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.500]   They had been saying late 2013, and he said, no, not till 2014.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   And now they've all aligned behind that.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.180]   That seems to be the consensus.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.460]   And anybody who's played with Glass realizes,
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.060]   for this to be a consumer product,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.260]   they need to do a little bit more.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.420]   Well, they need applications.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.380]   So they actually need to put it in the hands of developers.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:32.740]   No, do they?
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.540]   Because he can't--
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.180]   What?
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.060]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.900]   I mean, we were talking to Gina Cepani, who has hers.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.100]   And she said, I put the New York Times.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.140]   And I don't want to see headlines while I'm walking down
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.660]   the street.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.140]   What-- there's a limited number of things
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.500]   you can do with this device.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.900]   I mean, they don't do everything.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.940]   I mean, all we know right now is that the keynote is going
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.940]   to run three hours.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.820]   That's a long time to talk.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.100]   That's enough time to announce a bunch of stuff.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.380]   Yeah, but Google also has a gazillion products.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.820]   And it is the Google conference.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:06.500]   So with an Apple keynote, we know that it's going to be--
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.380]   it's very hit-striven, right?
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.620]   Like, all they really spend time announcing
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.300]   is either how many things they've sold or new products.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.460]   And with Google, they have a gazillion small new products,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.820]   that most of which I think kind of get forgotten about
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.780]   pretty quickly with a three-hour keynote, man.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.580]   They're going to have a really hard time keeping
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.500]   people's attention.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.700]   You're going to forget about it before the keynote's over.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.300]   Seriously.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.380]   What do they talk about?
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.900]   Better take good notes.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.340]   What about-- do you think they'll talk a little bit about their
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.140]   gigabit internet initiative?
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.620]   It's gone, it seems to me, better than they had thought.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.220]   They really initially said we're going to pick a city as a
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.340]   demo.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.220]   And they've announced two more cities.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.980]   And it feels like it's getting some steam.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.380]   It's getting some headway.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.420]   What is the French internet situation?
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.380]   Do you really want to know?
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.740]   No, it's actually really good.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.340]   And I don't want to know.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.380]   It's cheap.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.340]   It's as fast as DSL is fast.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.820]   It's government sponsored.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.260]   Not really.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.420]   No, no, no, no.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.180]   Well, most-- yeah, most are all of it is private.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.620]   But most of it is DSL.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.540]   Cable is maybe 5% to 10%.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.220]   And there's no fiber?
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.500]   Is there fiber out there?
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.380]   There is fiber.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.860]   But it's taking a good long while to be rolled out, because
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.780]   it costs a bunch of money.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.900]   So basically, what you get now in France for 30 to 40 euros a
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.220]   month is all you can eat internet on DSL plus TV, plus
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.500]   unlimited phone service.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.260]   Well, that's pretty good if you get all of that.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.460]   It's what you do.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.020]   What is the DSL speeds?
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.260]   Because in America, DSL speeds never really--
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.060]   It just kind of--
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.660]   It sort of depends on how far you are from what you call
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.940]   it PBX.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.380]   So it's, I don't know, maybe between 3, 5 and 20 megabits.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.660]   Yes, typical DSL.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.820]   Yeah, typical DSL.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.860]   And you have a DSL, too, I think, for the most part.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.940]   And VDSL is coming out.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.980]   I mean, we're OK.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.060]   So right now, Google Fiber, if you go to the Fiber page,
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.500]   is in Kansas City.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.140]   Both Missouri and Kansas, I thought that was funny, as
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.740]   well as some of the suburbs.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.140]   It's going to Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah next.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.180]   I-- what do you think, Ryan?
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.860]   I mean, you think this is a business for Google?
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.260]   I mean, initially, it just felt like they wanted to show
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.420]   other ISPs.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.420]   Hey, it's possible to do gigabit.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.140]   And maybe even customers want this.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.740]   This is a weird one.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.580]   This normally will take a long time to recoup costs.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.460]   Very expensive.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.900]   Google is in a very unique position
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.260]   to throw cash at these kinds of initiatives.
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.940]   In some ways, this kind of reminds me of where Microsoft
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.540]   was about a decade ago, where they just had all this money
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.620]   sitting in the bank and burning a hole in their pockets.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.660]   And very few companies have the luxury of being able to say,
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.460]   all right, well, let's take on a multi-billion dollar bet
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.060]   that will take us 10 years to achieve some kind of market
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.300]   dominance.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.100]   And Xbox was one of the projects that came out of that.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.540]   And they still haven't made the money back.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.060]   No, actually, Xbox is profitable for them now.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.220]   But they haven't made the money back.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.340]   Oh, they lost so much.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.420]   Yeah, I don't know if they ever released or will release
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.900]   something saying that they made it all back.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.860]   But the point is really, when you reach a certain level of size
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.100]   as a company and a certain amount of excess capital,
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.260]   you have to put it to work.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.620]   And this is a really interesting way to put it to work.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.580]   Will it make them money?
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.300]   Will it eventually be profitable for them?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.820]   I don't know.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.580]   But I'm glad somebody's doing this, because, man,
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.140]   this is pathetic.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.580]   Nobody's built new infrastructure, new communications
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.740]   infrastructure in this country in quite a long time.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.620]   Google's kind of unique in the capitalist world,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.260]   because I think they seem to be a little longer-term focused
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.620]   than a normal company.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.900]   And certainly not quarter to quarter.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.460]   When they started in Kansas City, it made sense,
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.180]   as sort of an experiment.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.260]   It's an experiment.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.740]   But now they're rolling it out in several markets.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.060]   That's what puzzles me.
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.580]   What more information are they going to get from Provo
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.380]   than they got from Kennedy?
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.260]   They say, we make money if you're using the internet.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.380]   That's all we just want you to use the internet more.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.300]   And so if we roll out faster internet,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.940]   you'll use it more.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   We'll make money.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.380]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.940]   But one of the reasons might be that at some point,
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.180]   the internet is going to somehow have to overtake,
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.780]   or at least seriously compete with TV.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.540]   And in order to compete with TV, you
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.780]   need HD, reliable HD streams, and possibly fairly soon
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.900]   ultra HD, 4K.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900]   And that needs really, really fast connections,
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.740]   which we don't have.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.660]   So testing it in a couple of towns
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.180]   and then maybe expanding it, not as a business,
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.020]   but as a way to pressure other ISPs to up their game,
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.620]   might make sense in the long run in the grand scheme of things.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.500]   That might be about video.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.460]   I'm just speculating.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:01.860]   I agree.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.740]   It might be about balance of power.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.460]   Google's showing the ISPs and the telecom world.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.020]   Don't mess with us, because we could actually be the network.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.740]   Tomorrow.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.140]   And they have to be a feared, as I am, of bandwidth caps,
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.700]   which could kill stuff like what we're doing right now.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.980]   Totally.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.340]   And these-- you have in France the--
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.620]   is it Hadoopi?
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.100]   Hadoopi.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.580]   Hadoopi.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.180]   Hadoopi laws.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.780]   Not too popular.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.300]   By the time this show comes out, it might not exist anymore.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.500]   That would be a great thing, although we have the carriers
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.300]   voluntarily.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.860]   The ISPs voluntarily agreed to support a six strikes, not
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.300]   a three strikes, but a six strikes law here in the US.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.980]   Even though nobody was demanding it of them,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.460]   they said, oh, well, we'll do it anyway.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.020]   That way you won't bother us anymore.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.100]   It's better than passing a law.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.780]   It's easier.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   Quickly.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.820]   It's actually even a little bit worse.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.060]   The power that the ISPs have-- we have one issue here in France
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.660]   with Free, which is one of the biggest ISPs, which is purposefully
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.140]   throttling YouTube to the point that it's unusable.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.500]   So that might be also reason for rebalancing the power,
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.020]   at least making a show of force.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.300]   This kind of regressive policymaking
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.740]   is really bad for YouTube.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.500]   It's not merely that we're going to make it faster.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.300]   That's good for us.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.900]   It's also that it could go the other way and actually be bad for us
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.580]   if we don't really show people what a free and open and fast
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.900]   internet really can be.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.620]   Sure.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.540]   All right.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.220]   We all agree.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.260]   And it's actually worse on mobile.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.140]   And mobile-- well, mobile's a whole nother.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.580]   Totally.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.180]   Kettle a fish.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.020]   That's a tough--
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.460]   Well, I mean, with 4G, it shouldn't be.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.260]   I mean, it has to be a little more managed than your DSL,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.340]   fiber, and cable network.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.780]   But the cost is you have to get high-speed data
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.660]   to each of these cell towers, right?
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.980]   But notice how for mobile people are just getting used
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.300]   to the idea that what they can do on the network
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.540]   is just different from the wide internet.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.740]   They're not expecting as much.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   No.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.180]   No, no.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.420]   Time Warner apparently is--
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.700]   according to Stunwin in our chat room
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.780]   has been confirmed that they are throttling YouTube
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.580]   and Twitch, the Justin TV gaming.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.700]   It seems so aggressive to me.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.260]   Well, in France, some people--
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.180]   Go ahead, Missy, but I can't.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.380]   Let's start speaking French.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.580]   So I should go right ahead.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.220]   Just take over.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   I told you.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.580]   You have been wrong.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.860]   Another thing that Free is doing in a real bout with YouTube
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.100]   and Google is that they actually activated, by default,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.460]   an adblock service on every-- all of their users' connections.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.660]   And they ended up deactivating it because they're not
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.620]   completely insane.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.740]   They were logging the apps that we were using.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.300]   No, they were blocking ads.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.060]   They're blocking adblock.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.140]   OK.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.460]   I thought you said adblock.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.460]   Right in your DSL box.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.180]   Enable body default.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.140]   So who's ads were they blocking?
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.420]   Everyone's.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.580]   Well, mostly Google's.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.500]   Again, you can see why this is suddenly more than a hobby
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.780]   for people, right?
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.500]   It is absolutely makes perfect sense.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.780]   It should be more than a hobby.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.460]   The thing to remember, though, is they're
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.500]   going to call it a hobby.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.220]   They're going to keep calling it experimental,
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.300]   because the moment they say, this is a thing that we're doing,
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.100]   and it's a business for us.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.300]   Not only do they have to start meeting market expectations
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.340]   in terms of being a public company,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.900]   but then they also have to actually deal with regulation
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.780]   in a very different way.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.100]   Right now, they don't really have to deal with that regulation,
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.580]   because they're having the cities come to them.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.900]   They're saying, hey, we want to do this in your city.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.700]   If you're interested as a city, come apply.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.900]   And so now they don't have to deal with all the red tape.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.060]   They can just come in and do their thing.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.740]   That's a really great position to be in.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.180]   Obviously, it limits your rollout,
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.860]   but nobody else is doing this anyway.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.060]   So what's the difference?
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.540]   Right.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.740]   Well, and those who have tried-- and especially cities who
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.700]   have tried to roll out their own public internet
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.300]   have been thwarted by laws.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.860]   I mean, as soon as Philadelphia rolled out free Wi-Fi
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.100]   in the town where Comcast is based, Comcast went to Congress,
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.860]   and they made sure that this was illegal.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.300]   You're competing with a free market
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.660]   by providing a good service.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.140]   That's bad for our business.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.220]   And you can bet that that's the next step.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.380]   It's like, whoa, maybe we shouldn't let--
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.340]   we should get to do something about this Google.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.500]   This Google guy.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   You're in San Francisco, Ryan.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.820]   I noticed the other day I was very impressed,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.660]   went to San Francisco with an AT&T phone,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.260]   was getting amazing LTE speeds.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.380]   They've really upgraded their backbone.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.820]   Yeah, they've been able to maintain a really great LTE.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.740]   I remember the first week I had the iPhone 5 last year,
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.940]   and I was getting like 50, 60 megabits on it.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.060]   I was just blown away.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.420]   I mean, that's actually faster than when I get it home on cable.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.580]   I was a peer deli square with HTC One.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.620]   Got 50 megabits down and 8 megabits up.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.140]   It's crazy.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.100]   It's a great time, because it's a great time to be alive.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.420]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.740]   You know, used to be-- well, that's the thing.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.900]   I think in San Francisco, it was a real struggle
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.660]   when iPhones were so popular.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.700]   AT&T really wasn't prepared for the amount of data
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.140]   that iPhone users used.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.340]   And for the first three or four years of the iPhone,
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.660]   it was horrible.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.260]   You couldn't-- it phoned it didn't even work,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.020]   let alone the data.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.900]   And I think AT&T jumped.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.540]   It takes a while, especially in San Francisco,
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.580]   to get through regulations, like several years,
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.980]   to put up a new cell tower.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.500]   So they probably started working on this in 2008 or 2009.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.420]   And finally, it's starting to click.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.740]   And I think that's probably true nationwide.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.780]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.460]   It means it is possible, as a mobile provider,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.060]   to give better high-speed internet than a land-based
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.220]   provider.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.540]   It's incredible.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.660]   It all depends, right?
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.260]   It depends on how many people are on your mobile
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.700]   network, depends on where you are,
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.180]   and also depends on what your landline is.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.060]   If your landline is Google Fiber,
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.060]   then you're always--
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.620]   Well, always.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:21:14.980]   But your chances of getting better internet than a
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.380]   mower are far higher.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.580]   Or Verizon.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.180]   Verizon was rolling out Fios.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.020]   It was estimated it cost about $5,000 per new customer.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   OK.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.420]   I know that there are still people getting Fios.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.540]   I just don't think it's as aggressive.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.260]   I mean, they actually-- they advertise Fios all over the
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.700]   new Iron Man movie.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.540]   Really?
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.700]   Like his product placement?
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.500]   You mean like Tony Stark says, boy, if, hey, goodness, I have
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.180]   Verizon Fios in my suit, does he really?
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.980]   He'd definitely-- he'd not Verizon Fios, but they show
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.540]   the branding.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.820]   And then he talks about searching the Oracle Cloud.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.620]   No, please.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.220]   No, I'm not going to see that movie.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:52.660]   That's it.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.660]   Seriously.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.220]   The fun thing is when you watch the movie again--
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.020]   It was not my favorite.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.540]   Sorry.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.620]   The fun thing is when you watch the movie again 10 years
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.860]   later, it gets so late.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.460]   Yeah, it's dated.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   It's like Wall Street.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.980]   Look at my Sony, Ericsson's small phone.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.260]   I hate that.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:05.740]   Yeah, especially.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.140]   And then you look at those robot suits.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.660]   Like, man, my robot suit's way more advanced.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.020]   Oh, that Tony Stark was nothing.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.780]   No, I was watching.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.060]   There's a Showtime show that I really like with Don
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.380]   Cheetel about management consultants.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.220]   And unaccountably, everybody in the show is carrying a
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.900]   Nokia Lumia 920.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.700]   Like, you never see those in real life.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.380]   Anybody have a 920 here?
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.060]   No.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.620]   But in the show, everybody has a 920.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.220]   House of lies.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.460]   It's actually a good show.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.100]   You've seen it?
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.260]   They have it in France?
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.060]   No.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.500]   That's because it has Le Nude-tie.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:39.980]   No.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   We love nudity.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.820]   We don't have a problem with nudity in France.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.300]   But you know, I have an internet connection.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.020]   It's just weird.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.420]   That's why product placement-- it jars me out of the
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.220]   reality of the show.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.460]   And they make a point every once in a while of showing
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.300]   the screen so all its windows, phone, you could see the
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.780]   contacts are nice and big.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.380]   And I mean, just it's--
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.420]   Larry Ellison had a cameo in one of the earlier Iron Man
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   somebody's telling me.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.180]   Is that true?
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.500]   So did Elon Musk?
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.220]   Well, Elon Musk is Tony Stark.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.540]   So that's appropriate.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.100]   Well, that's who John Favreau modeled tonight.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.540]   Really?
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.340]   That makes sense.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.740]   That interpretation of Iron Man was modeled after
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   Elon Musk.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.420]   It's perfect.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:16.940]   Who else?
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.820]   Who better?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.820]   We're going to talk--
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.260]   I guess we'll see what Google I/O brings on Wednesday.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.620]   And we'll cover it here.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.100]   And I'm sure you will on gadget and you guys will on
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.500]   PlanetCrant.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.220]   So you're out here just for Google I/O?
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.700]   No, no, no.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.220]   We're also doing a show on Big Data and going to see
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.340]   companies in Valley.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.980]   We rarely come here to do just one thing.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.540]   One thing.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.340]   Right.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.220]   Last time I saw you was E3 in Los Angeles.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.660]   Of course.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.460]   And you'll be back in June.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.380]   And you'll see us again.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.460]   And then Patrick Beijas just stuck in his small three--
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.140]   That's sad.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.700]   We should get him out of the kitchen once in a while.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.380]   Come on over.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.020]   United has a new direct flight from Paris to San Francisco.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.500]   It's so sad.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.020]   Can come here for 750 euros.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.780]   Return.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.620]   That's cool.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.020]   7 euros 50?
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.180]   No 750, my friend.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.460]   You need to get up more often.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.300]   That would be a good deal.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.460]   That would be a good deal.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.860]   So Mars Worm says there's a show that has lots of
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.900]   Windows 8 product placement.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.860]   I haven't seen Windows 8 yet in TV, but she says--
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.540]   and I'll see--
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.380]   Air-O.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.900]   Air-O.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.380]   I haven't seen it.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.660]   Air-O has a lot of Windows 8.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.940]   Elementary, really?
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.700]   What's happening-- and I know this for a fact--
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.980]   is that television ads don't work.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.780]   So these guys are looking for ways to get--
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.980]   because they know everybody gets up or fast forwards
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.460]   with the DVR.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.860]   So they know nobody's watching those ads,
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.980]   so they've got to get them into the content.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.100]   I think that's really the future--
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.300]   It's a native advertising.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   Native advertising.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   Like for instance, if when we want to mail things out,
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.620]   we always use this really nice scale,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.460]   and we use a site called stamps.com.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.220]   And it just-- you know, whenever--
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.500]   That's a nice segue.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   Win it!
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.940]   What?
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.820]   A professional.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.660]   You're rolling it with the lower third, Jack.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.100]   You want this guy honking you right?
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.140]   I did not see this coming.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.460]   I really thought at some point that we would be doing--
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.460]   like we'd be coca-cola, the refreshing break.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.900]   And that never really took place.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.300]   We tried some energy drinks.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.820]   I wear Haynes underwear, but none of it really caught on
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.460]   until we found stamps.com.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.460]   And then everywhere you go on the Twitbreak house,
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.220]   you see our stamps.com/uspsk.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.700]   Actually, we do use stamps.com.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.940]   And anybody does a lot of mailing.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.500]   It wouldn't be good for your Christmas card list.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.740]   But if you do a lot of mailing in your business,
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.180]   it's crazy to go down to the post office to buy stamps.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.300]   Worse, it's crazier to get a postage meter.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.260]   That's everybody in business.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.140]   So you have a postage meter, right?
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.060]   I see people in the post office waiting in line with their
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.820]   postage meter.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.220]   That's really dumb.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.820]   Why lease a postage meter?
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.900]   Why buy special ink?
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.220]   Why go to the post office at all?
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.380]   You'll save up to 80% compared to a postage meter with stamps.com.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.580]   And think of it as postage on demand.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.740]   You could print your own stamps and labels right from your
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.340]   computer and your printer.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.420]   You always have exactly the right postage, because you've
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:02.980]   got the scale.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.460]   The USB scale tells you exactly.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.460]   Never again, postage do.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.180]   That's very embarrassing in a business.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.980]   It'll print right on the envelope so you can have your
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.300]   return address, the company logo, special offers, that kind
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.260]   of stuff, the postage, and of course the recipient's address.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.700]   And it'll pull that from QuickBooks, your address book.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.860]   If you're doing fulfillment like from eBay or Etsy or Amazon
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.420]   or PayPal, it'll pull it from there.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.140]   If you're doing international mailing, it'll fill out the
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:28.500]   form.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.340]   Do you have anything like this in France where you have a
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.820]   private company that you print postage?
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.060]   No, that's not a website that actually sells your
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.420]   cool.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.140]   Exactly which stuff that you should use for what kind of
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.140]   postage you're going to purchase.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   Does it all have classes of mail?
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.340]   No, we don't have sends of calls.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.340]   You need stamps.com.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.820]   It's only in the US right now.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.820]   Oh.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.340]   Well, for now, until the USPS goes out of business.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.340]   Yeah, it should be international.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.580]   Use it well, you can't.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.660]   No, it can't go out of business.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.500]   It's in the Kankstokpushin.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.180]   Kankkokpushin.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.740]   You're sitting up thing there.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.020]   It's a part of the--
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.700]   We have a constitutionally derived right to junk mail.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.460]   It's really true.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.780]   What does the post office do besides the liver junk mail
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.100]   in my house?
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.300]   Well, they also deliver things that you're sending
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.260]   through stamps.com.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.980]   But yeah.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.420]   Well, I'm too kind of killing your own that right now.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.300]   No, I don't know.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.060]   No, people still use the post office.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.740]   If you're shipping stuff to use the post office.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.580]   I'm trying to save it.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.420]   Maybe I just said--
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.260]   No, no.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:22.940]   But it is true.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.780]   When I look in my mail box, that's why I go to Amazon
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.700]   and buy more stuff.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.980]   So I'll have some good stuff in my mail.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.900]   The mail care is going around.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.420]   So on their regular rounds, they'll pick up your packages.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.540]   You don't have to make the trip to the post office.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.460]   Even-- and there's a rule in the US, you cannot mail a package
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.140]   more than 13 ounces in a mailbox because they want to kind
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.940]   of look you in the eye and make sure you're not mailing
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.540]   something bad.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.180]   But because you're using stamps.com, that rule is waived.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.460]   The mail care will come to you, pick up the packages
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.460]   of any size.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.140]   You can even schedule free pickups.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.220]   It is the best way to use the Postal Service.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.260]   And I want you to try it free.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.580]   Now, you're going to go to the stamps.com page.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.540]   But you're going to see here this $80 value.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.340]   You may be kind of saying, that looks pretty good.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.260]   I'll take that.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:05.940]   No.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.980]   Click the cool old fashioned microphone
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.860]   in the upper right hand corner and enter our offer code
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.860]   TWIT, T-W-I-T. And that $80 bonus value turns
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.540]   into a $110 special offer.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.020]   Oh, my god.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.100]   Yeah, that's a pretty good deal.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.220]   You get $55 in free postage.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.620]   It takes over the first few months of your account.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.060]   You get the scale, which is nice.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.820]   You just pay shipping and handling for that.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.660]   $50 value.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.900]   And by the way, you can cancel and the scale is yours.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.820]   Get to keep it.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.020]   $5 supply kit and a four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.020]   There's no better way to mail stuff than stamps.com.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.340]   Try it today.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.860]   No, it is true, though.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.100]   I don't get-- see, I don't get magazines.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.260]   I just got today-- I got our restoration hardware catalog
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.260]   that was this thick, weighed 10 pounds in the mail.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.140]   And I thought, this is such a waste,
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.060]   because I could just go online.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.980]   Why are they killings?
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.060]   All these trees, this beautiful four color catalog.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.900]   So I found a program, an app, on Android or iPhone,
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.540]   is called Paper Karma.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.420]   It's so awesome.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.060]   You take a picture of the junk mail, including
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.540]   the person who sent it, and then you--
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.700]   Paper Karma cancels it for you.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.820]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.020]   They send-- you need this in France.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.980]   So you scan the mail, and then it says,
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.540]   it actually sends off a thing to the people.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.580]   So I just requested that restoration hardware
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.340]   stop sending me its catalog.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.340]   This is all junk mail.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.140]   There's another one called catalog choice
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.380]   that I've used that's pretty good, too.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380]   Isn't that kind of the same thing?
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.500]   Isn't that cool?
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.980]   Maybe it's putting the post office out of business.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.780]   I don't know, but I think it just seems like a waste of trees.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.620]   Are you sure they don't just get your address
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   and then send you more junk mail?
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.020]   I have been using this for a year, and yes,
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.500]   it's really made a big--
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.820]   there's a law in the US that says that you can--
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.180]   actually, it's not a law.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.660]   It's the Direct Marketing Association,
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.820]   the people who-- all these guys are members of the DMA.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.700]   They agreed.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.500]   It's kind of like a do not call list.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:10.940]   They agree.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.620]   If you say specifically, if you write us a letter or whatever,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.260]   and I don't want your catalogs, they have to honor that.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.180]   So that's all they're doing.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.980]   It's taking advantage of that.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.700]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:26.180]   Vince Surf says we're going to have an interplanetary internet.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.140]   We watched before the show, and I recommend this.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.500]   Commander Chris Hadfield, who was leaving the International
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.060]   Space Station after some time there.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.020]   He was there for months, right?
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.780]   And he's the Canadian commander last day was today, who did--
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.500]   he showed you what it looks like when you cry in space.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.300]   He did all these great videos, and he
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.060]   did a last farewell video to the ISS.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.460]   He did his version of David Bowie's space out of the ground,
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.500]   controlled, and majored.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.420]   Incredible.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.740]   Because here we are for the first time
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.940]   seeing this song about a guy up in a tin can in space,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.860]   and he's actually in a tin can up in space
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.740]   with beautiful views of the Earth.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.100]   Wow, is that a great video?
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.380]   Just went up today.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.460]   Five months he was up there.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.060]   He is the kind of guy you want to have.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.380]   Maybe Vint will go next time.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.700]   He's the guy you have.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.380]   I'm going to talk about Google having a long view of things.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.540]   They're actually building a space network.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.020]   And Vint Cerf says, this project started in 1998.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:33.660]   He asked himself, what should I be doing now
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.100]   that will be 25 years from now?
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.020]   He said, when Bob Kahn and I created the internet in 1973,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.860]   we were creating something that wouldn't really
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.220]   reach fruition for 25 years.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.780]   So in 1998, 25 years later, he said, what should we
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.380]   be doing for the next 25 years?
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.300]   He got together with the Jet Propulsion Lab
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:57.700]   and started thinking about an interplanetary internet.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.060]   The question was, would TCP/IP work
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.140]   as an interplanetary protocol?
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.740]   And it turned out the answer is no.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.820]   That means for good reason.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.500]   If you send a packet to Mars, it's going to take what?
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.740]   30, 40, 50 minutes to actually get there?
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.820]   It's not robust enough.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.820]   Hell of a ping.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.380]   So they have a new protocol called the bundle protocol
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.180]   for interplanetary internet.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.380]   They're big bundles of information, but it's
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.540]   storing forward so you don't need the kind of the act
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.860]   and the knack and all of that.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:38.180]   But it has bigger storage and it can hold it for a longer time.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.100]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.380]   That is taking the long view.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.540]   And there are devices out in space, apparently,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   that are going to be starting to use that.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.260]   And they've been working on it for like 15 years,
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.100]   which is even more amazing.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.900]   I just love the vision these guys have.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.220]   They've read a lot of science fiction.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.820]   I think he was saying that some of the rovers on Mars
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.460]   are already using it.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.100]   And they even found applications for it here on Earth
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.580]   with some Sami tribes in Lapland that
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.540]   don't have regular access to the network.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.100]   So they take these bundles of data
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.460]   and then we transmit it whenever they get back into the network.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.620]   It's fascinating.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.900]   It's a fascinating read.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.660]   Looking ahead, we got Google I/O this week.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.820]   And then in a couple of weeks, May 21,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.100]   we're going to see the next Xbox.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.340]   You're going to come out for that?
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:30.820]   Nope.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.320]   Nope.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.620]   You're going to watch that on TV.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.500]   I'm going to watch it live from Redmond.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.260]   What do we know about the next Xbox?
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.420]   One of the questions a lot of people were asking is,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.340]   will it require an always on internet connection to play games?
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.260]   Now we kind of know it won't.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.060]   I mean, at least for like first person games.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.940]   They're saying very clearly, we'd know.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.420]   That was a mistake.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.900]   You misunderstood.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.100]   An internal Microsoft email sent to all full-time employees
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:08.220]   working on the next Xbox, which meant basically, leak this.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.500]   Right?
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:08.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.700]   What do you think?
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.060]   Absolutely.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.060]   Definitely.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.740]   Definitely leak.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.140]   You don't send it to everybody on the team,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.620]   unless you say, you know, it wouldn't be a bad idea
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.860]   if you know a journalist.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.980]   Quote, Durango-- that's the next Xbox--
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.940]   is designed to deliver the future of entertainment
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.860]   while engineered to be tolerant of today's internet.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.860]   There are a number of scenarios our users expect
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   to work without an internet connection.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.340]   These should just work regardless of their current connection
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.380]   status, including, but not limited to, playing a Blu-ray
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.740]   status, watching live TV, and, yes, playing a single-player game.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.660]   It says right here.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.180]   And, yes, playing a single player.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.740]   It's like they want this to be released.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.980]   So it will, interestingly, Blu-ray--
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.340]   Xbox did not have Blu-ray.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.260]   PlayStation did.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.060]   Well, I mean, it sounds like that.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.700]   Does that mean--
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.060]   Resurrect HD DVD, you know.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.740]   Right.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.700]   They're too late for that.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.220]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.260]   Microsoft made the wrong bet, didn't they?
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.540]   They bet on HD DVD.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.900]   Well, because they were betting against Sony.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.500]   Yeah, that's what that was.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.460]   It wasn't that they were betting heavily on HD DVD.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.100]   It's that they just want to disrupt Sony's game plan.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.620]   And they did.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.540]   For a couple of years, they made Sony's live health.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.420]   Not just Sony, the rest of us, right?
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.540]   Yeah, sure.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.100]   But, I mean, come on, it's Microsoft.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.220]   Have you reused Windows?
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.780]   I'm using it right now.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.220]   Much to my chagrin, but I'm sorry.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.380]   I know the chat room is going to leave.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.300]   Not a very nice machine.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.380]   No, this is the-- I've shown this before.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.460]   My Acer S7 is very thin and light and beautiful.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.860]   And I really wanted to use Windows 8
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   and give it a full chance.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.020]   But it is still a little bit touchy.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.380]   Microsoft says, we've sold 100 million of them.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.820]   What do you want?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.260]   And in fact--
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.300]   Well, that's actually a good question.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.180]   What do you want?
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.180]   I don't know why people dislike Windows 8 so much.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.220]   There's this whole thing about the menu screen, which
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.260]   is really the--
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.860]   I'm sorry, the start screen, which is really the start menu,
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.820]   expanded.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.620]   So how is it so much worse that it's become unusable
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.980]   because it takes the whole screen?
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.180]   I'm not sure I understand what's so bad about Windows 8.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.340]   Do you use it, Patrick?
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.100]   Not as my main machine, but I have--
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.180]   That's why you don't understand what's so bad about it.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.260]   If you had to force yourself, as I did, to use it.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.980]   OK, but you can tell me.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.380]   You're the tech guy.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.140]   I can tell you.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.500]   I don't know how to go through that.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.780]   So I consider myself someone who
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.860]   should be able to get around an interface.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.820]   I mean, there are very few interfaces
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.820]   I've ever not been able to get around.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.900]   I sat down to my wife Veronica's Windows 8 machine
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.580]   because I had to change--
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.420]   It's a long story.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.300]   First of all, why is Veronica using Windows 8?
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.620]   Is she like Windows 8?
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.660]   She uses it for gaming.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.340]   She has a gaming PC.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:55.820]   Oh, of course.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.300]   I do too.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.260]   Yeah, of course.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.900]   So yeah, that's her primary.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.500]   She doesn't really--
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.340]   She has a gameplay, skyroom, and bio-shock infinite on a Mac.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.940]   Yeah, I don't think she really uses it for anything
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.540]   other than that.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.740]   So anyway, she was gone.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   She wasn't around.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.220]   I was all alone with a Windows 8 machine.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.460]   I had honestly--
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.020]   it's kind of weird to think that I had never used one before,
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.860]   but I had.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.420]   And this is a couple months back.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.500]   And so I sat down and I tried to use it.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.140]   And I had no idea how the gems system worked.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.220]   I had no idea how to basically get around the startment charms.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.540]   The start menu was gone.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.380]   I was just completely befuddled by it.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.180]   And I left feeling more frustrated
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.580]   in about 10 to 15 minutes of using it
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.540]   than I've ever felt using any piece of software in memory.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.260]   I mean, I literally could not think of a time
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.580]   I was more frustrated using anything.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.660]   And yeah, OK, maybe it's because I
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.740]   have these preconceived notions about how Windows should work.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.260]   But the reality is if somebody who's been using Windows
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.220]   for the last 20 years is having this hard of a time
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.020]   just doing basic discoverability
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.420]   around the operating system, there's
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.460]   some serious issues there.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.020]   You know, every time we bring this up and I bring it up
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.780]   a lot, we'll get people to say, I
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   don't know what you're talking about.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.460]   Use Windows 8.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.060]   I love it.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.740]   It's great.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.180]   I haven't had no trouble with it.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.060]   Many people say, give it a little time.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.580]   You will learn how to use it in half an hour.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.940]   But I'm with you, Ryan.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.300]   And I've been using it for six months now.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.860]   And it's not that I don't know how to use it.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.180]   I do.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.340]   But it's not-- what it feels like is this kind of mishmosh
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.340]   hybrid between a touch-based tablet operating system
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.940]   and a desktop operating system.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.020]   It's as if Microsoft couldn't make up their minds.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.340]   I think they wanted to.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.500]   And I think they're going to try to move the world towards
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.740]   touch-based tablet operating system, a Windows RT style.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.140]   But even on RT, they could not bring themselves
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.940]   to a band in the desktop.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.820]   And they're right.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.780]   Because the majority of Windows users in business at least
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.860]   are using the desktop.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.500]   That's what they want.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.380]   I felt really dumb.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.980]   I mean, it made me feel dumb.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.140]   It made me feel incompetent.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.900]   It made me feel like I--
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.540]   what business did I have using a computer?
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.420]   It was just not-- it was not positive.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.980]   It left me feeling like I never want to touch that again.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.620]   It made me feel negative about myself.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.980]   And that's kind of a weird thing for a computer to do.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.780]   But it did.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:13.300]   It happened.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   And again, that's something that really happens very often.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.940]   And especially not in my world where I play with everything.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.060]   Right.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.900]   Here is this trend.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.860]   And I think it's a bad trend.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.620]   I mentioned this before, where companies are starting
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.180]   to tell people, no, no, get over it.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.180]   We're going to tell you how to use it.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.260]   And in this case, Microsoft has said, well,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.820]   we're going to give you an update, Windows Blue.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.460]   I don't think they've actually said this,
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.620]   but the rumors are strong that Windows Blue will include
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.700]   two features that people have been begging for.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.340]   One is boot to desktop.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.380]   So you don't boot into this Metro Start screen.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.460]   You boot into the desktop you're used to from Windows 7.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.580]   And then start button, not a start menu,
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.860]   but a start button on the desktop that when you click it
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.540]   brings you to the Metro Start screen.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.900]   And I think they're hoping that that will get over at least
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.780]   some of the problems.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   The reason this comes up-- and we've talked a lot about it--
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.660]   but Frank X Shaw, who is-- and this is the weirdest corporate
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.060]   title I've ever heard of--
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.740]   corporate vice president of corporate communications.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.820]   That tells you a little bit about Microsoft.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.620]   Corporate vice president is a rank.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.260]   It's a rank.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.340]   So he's a corporate vice president of corporate communications.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.180]   I mean, Ryan's not only enough to remember,
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.020]   but AOL used to have a vice president of cool.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.780]   Yeah, that's better.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.020]   In the corporate vice president of corporate communications.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.220]   But anyway, yes.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.740]   So you're right.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.740]   It's a rank.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.020]   But it sounds like he works at the Department of Redundancy
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.020]   Department.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.260]   It's a little strange.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.580]   Anyway, he says it's not a soda pop.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.180]   He says, and this almost feels like he's begging,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.100]   Windows 8 is a good product.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.860]   And it's getting better every day.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.500]   Unlike a can of soda--
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.820]   a computer operating-- I didn't compare it to a can of soda.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.380]   But anyway, apparently, somebody has--
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.540]   unlike a can of soda, a computer operating
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.580]   system offers different experiences
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.180]   to different customers to meet different needs.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.420]   I'll agree with that wall.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.220]   And this is-- if you listen carefully what Microsoft's up to--
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:11.580]   moving the entire industry toward an exciting future of touch.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   It's embarrassing to hear them actually explain to you
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.180]   why this should be good for you.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.620]   This is good for you.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.500]   But it's not soda.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.460]   It's carrots.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.500]   But I mean, I want to encourage this.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.380]   I want to encourage Microsoft to try--
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.300]   actually try new things and not just do a Windows 8
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.860]   that's like Windows 7 repackaged.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.180]   So of course, Windows 8 very much
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.980]   feels like a transition.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.140]   Hardware-wise and software-wise and interface-wise.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.900]   I guess Windows 9 will sort of homogenize all that.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.620]   Well, at least we can hope.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.740]   In a world, he says, where everyone is a publisher,
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.660]   there's a trend to the extreme.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.420]   In a world.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.380]   In a world where those who want to stand out
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.860]   opt for sensationalism and hyperbole over nuanced analysis.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.660]   In this world where page views are currency,
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.980]   heat is often more valued than light.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.860]   Stark, black and white characters
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.180]   are sometimes more valued than shades of gray.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.340]   Reality, saying bloggers are going after the page views.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.260]   And so they make things be--
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.980]   and so he says it's been a week like that.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.860]   And he-- and who are the two sources that have been going
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.940]   for the page views?
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.340]   Stark, not true, the economist and the financial times.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.500]   He uses as the examples of two publishers.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.780]   And then he says, but Gizmodo got it right.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.340]   He says, don't listen to these people on the edges
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.860]   like the financial times and the economist.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.020]   Listen to the center.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.540]   In the center, listening to feedback and improving a product
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.660]   is a good thing.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.420]   Heck, he says.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.100]   There was even a time when acknowledging
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.940]   that you were listening to feedback and acting on it
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.020]   was considered a good thing.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   Now, I might point out that Microsoft has not, in fact,
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.380]   listened to feedback.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.660]   And in fact, that's been the problem,
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.860]   is that they really did this without asking people.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.980]   In fact, even Julie Larson-Greeno, who's currently
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.980]   running the Windows 8 team, admits
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.220]   that they thought they didn't listen to people who
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.100]   use the desktop enough.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.740]   And when Steve Jobs does it, everyone applauds him or did.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.540]   Yeah, I mean, that must be what's going on
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.580]   within Microsoft.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.740]   They're like, oh boy, I mean, Apple's
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.540]   been telling people what's good for them for years.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.020]   And apparently, people enjoy that.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.980]   And we've tried it.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.820]   And we've tried it.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.140]   And then this is the feedback we get.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.900]   This whole blog post is weird.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.580]   It's a very weird blog post.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.980]   He ends with a link to this Gizmodo article that says--
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.180]   Don't stop believing.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.500]   Dear Microsoft, don't pale on Windows 8.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.900]   But come on, you have to remind that a lot of bloggers
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.540]   and the tech press, in general, has been not very happy
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.420]   with Windows 8.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.220]   Rightly so.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.140]   With cause.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.220]   OK, I agree.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.180]   But then if we look towards the future a little bit,
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.780]   let's say that they do come up with these changes
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.220]   in Windows Blue this summer.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   Do you think this changes the system enough?
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.500]   And do you think we will get people saying, ah, finally,
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.860]   now we have a decent Windows?
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.420]   Because I think that might happen.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   That might be really--
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   Really?
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.180]   We've all seen this movie before.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.420]   Look at 8 to 7.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.780]   And then 7 to Vista.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.580]   And Vista, I mean, it's just every time they release
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.100]   a new Windows, it's incrementally better.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.420]   But in many ways, often worse.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.620]   And I just don't see it.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.020]   And Paul Theron, our Windows weekly host, did point out
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.820]   that had Microsoft done nothing, had Microsoft ignored touch,
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.540]   and just said, here's Windows 8.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.020]   It's a lot like Windows 7 only better.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   We would have all been saying, whoa, Microsoft's lost their mojo.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.520]   Exactly.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.860]   They're not keeping up with the future.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.300]   They're not recognizing--
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.500]   But I just feel like this is not the right answer.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.580]   Maybe I admire them for trying.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.940]   It feels like what the Japanese used to do.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.420]   And how do you design it to Yoda?
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:01.180]   You do innovation by 12 people around a table.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.780]   And they all have to agree on the list of features.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.780]   And then they just send it out to the engineers to build it.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.900]   That's what it feels like right now.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.620]   It needs to be streamlined in a way.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.980]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.820]   When it's installed, it needs to be something for PCs
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.060]   and some things for the footage interfaces.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.300]   But I'm really actually eager to see
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.660]   what Windows Blue's going to bring, especially since what I
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.140]   have at the office is still Windows XP.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.860]   Well, I'm also curious how much they're going to charge,
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.860]   if they're going to charge, or if they're going to say this is--
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.100]   They're an upgrade?
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.900]   They'll give it away.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.660]   They have to give it away.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.540]   They have to give it.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.900]   I think it's a point one.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.500]   I'll tell you, here's what I'm interpreting from this blog
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.620]   post and another data point is that Microsoft is actually
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.700]   very nervous right now.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.020]   PC sales are dropping off.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.580]   Yes, they sold 100 million copies.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.620]   That's not how many they wanted to sell or hoped to sell.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.100]   There's a softening of the market.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.060]   And I imagine the OAMs, like Lenovo and Dell,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.940]   are also saying to them, guys, we're
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.020]   having a hard time selling this stuff.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.660]   They had big hopes.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:08.260]   So the other data point is that Bill Gates is-- now, normally
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.220]   Bill does not talk about Microsoft.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.860]   Bill talks about his initiatives in Africa,
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.740]   his charitable enterprises, his philanthropy, rightly so.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.980]   That's his focus.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.740]   They got him on CNBC saying how great the surface was.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.100]   And I really think that the fact that Microsoft has clearly
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.540]   gone to Bill and said, Bill, please,
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:32.260]   can you make some appearances and shore up Windows 8?
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.700]   He said, tablets are growing in popularity and, quote,
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.940]   it's going to be harder and harder to distinguish products
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.260]   that are PCs versus tablets.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.220]   He says, the surface brings the portability of the tablet
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.420]   with the richness of the PC.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.780]   That's the core of what Microsoft's
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.260]   trying to accomplish, right?
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.980]   He also said-- this is where he went too far--
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.300]   of people using iPads.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.340]   A lot of those users are frustrated.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.460]   They can't type.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.940]   They can't create documents.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.860]   They don't have office.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.180]   So that's why the iPad is such a flop.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.860]   That's a bit Bill Centric.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.540]   And by the way, the only reason doesn't have office
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.500]   is because Microsoft is not shipped office for the iPad.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.580]   That is a very good point.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.940]   Actually, I hadn't really thought of it.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.460]   Isn't that in that way?
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.060]   We didn't give them office.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.540]   Yes.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.540]   We didn't give them office.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   One thing's supposed to.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.300]   We didn't allow us for the platform.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.780]   Yeah, now the latest is they won't have it
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.380]   till later in 2014, 2014.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.740]   It's going to be more than a year off.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   And that's probably so Bill Gates can say that kind of things.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.500]   Yeah, but it's a little bit self-serving.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.620]   OK, I'm pointing it out.
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:43.140]   Anyway, I wish Microsoft well, we need competition.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.740]   Apple is, by the way, and for those who say I'm an Apple
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.900]   fanatic, Apple isn't necessarily any better.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.420]   They're more and more imposing.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.180]   In fact, that's what they're famous for,
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.980]   imposing their vision of the world upon the rest of us.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.580]   And I'm not sure that-- well, we'll
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.660]   have to see what the next version of OS 10 brings.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:06.380]   But OS 10.8, Mountain Lion brought a lot of iPad and iPhone
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:11.380]   like interfaces, including full screen to Macintosh.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.780]   Yeah, and there was a lot of stuff there that was crap.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.580]   Like the full screen Apple launcher?
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.580]   Like, come on.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.460]   Nobody uses mission control.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.340]   Yeah, that's what drives me crazy about people
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.700]   who like cry fanboys.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.220]   Apple makes mistakes all the time,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.060]   and they get called on it every bit as much, if not more.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.500]   And the mistakes that Apple makes
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.540]   are in the grand scheme of things so much more minor,
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.820]   and they get so much more blown out of proportion.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.220]   But that's fine.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.140]   Expetitions are also different for Apple, and they know it.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.100]   Well, and to make this fair, yes, Microsoft's not
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.660]   making office for the iPad.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.380]   But Apple's not making iTunes for Windows 8 either.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.540]   You can run iTunes as a desktop app, but no Metro app.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.020]   And Microsoft says, this is Tammy Reller, CFO at Microsoft.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.540]   You should not expect an iTunes app on Windows 8
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.220]   anytime soon.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.260]   She says that welcome mat has been laid out.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.620]   It's not for lack of trying.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.140]   Apple's doing the same thing right back.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:08.940]   Now, let's be fair.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.180]   Apple isn't making iTunes for Snowhopper either.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:13.980]   They're not really--
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.940]   That's true.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.460]   They have not rewritten iTunes in a decade.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.860]   It is bloated.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.500]   It's gross.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.060]   It's ugly.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:20.700]   It's old.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.580]   It's just a mess.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.580]   And the fact that they wouldn't be rewriting that for Windows
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.100]   anytime soon is, I think, indicative of how they view
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:33.820]   iTunes, which is too bloated to save at this point.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:38.900]   But on the other hand, you kind of need it.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:43.940]   This is a great cartoon that kind of--
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.740]   Well, this is not it.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.100]   That was not it.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.260]   There's another one.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.820]   Remember the-- did anybody see the cartoon, the upgrade
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.300]   path for a PC, for a Mac?
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.700]   I'm going to see if I can find this.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.260]   Where you buy an iPod.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.260]   And then the iPod says, oh, you need the latest version of
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.420]   iTunes.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.340]   So you try to download the latest version of iTunes.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.780]   And iTunes says, oh, no, you need to have Snowleopard.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.500]   And Snowleopard says, no, I won't install on this Macintosh.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.420]   So in order to use this iPod, you now had to buy a new
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.980]   Macintosh so that you could run Snowleopard so that you
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.060]   can run iTunes.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.620]   Pure genius, I say.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.420]   You know, actually--
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.500]   Oh, you think it's accidental?
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.980]   No, I think it's exactly what--
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.740]   Oh, I said--
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.980]   Which is that Apple is just--
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.540]   they have a--
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.580]   There aren't enough good engineers in the world.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.820]   Kids go out and get a job programming.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.380]   It's what I said except I think I said Snowleopard.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.460]   And I meant to say lion.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.020]   But you get the point.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.380]   Lion.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.940]   The point is that it hasn't been written in any of OS 10's
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.420]   modern UI frameworks in quite a long time.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.100]   Not that Linux is any better because that Unity desktop
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.860]   really sucks.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.180]   There.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.580]   Now we've covered it all.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.060]   Our only job is to represent users, real users, and say,
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.180]   look, this should be better.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.900]   And if somebody doesn't tell the computer industry,
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.060]   you can make this better.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.700]   This should be better.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.820]   This should be easier to use.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.940]   Who's going to do it if not us, right?
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.260]   That's our job.
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.580]   And gizmodos, apparently.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   And apparently gizmodos.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.540]   Let's not talk about gizmodos.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.180]   Please, Microsoft, don't quit.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.060]   Yeah, don't give up.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.300]   No, I don't use Unity.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.820]   Sweet 1989, certainly.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.060]   Oh, Unity is not Linux.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:22.740]   Don't care full.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.060]   That's just a desktop.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.780]   You could use a nightmare.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.540]   It's because Ubuntu uses Unity.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.340]   And I don't use Ubuntu.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.260]   I use Mint.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.660]   By the way, Mint runs very nicely on this Acer S7.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:43.780]   And I've been so close to pushing that button.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.500]   This episode of This Week in Tech
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.100]   brought to you by our friends at Gazelle.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:48.780]   We were comparing.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.140]   We were measuring phones.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.260]   Got the Galaxy S4.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.180]   Very pretty phone.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:54.700]   Very nice.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.460]   Maybe you'd like to take that Galaxy S3
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.020]   and upgrade that to a Galaxy S4.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.620]   Good idea, Lee.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.700]   The time to do that would be now while that Galaxy S3
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.100]   has any value at all.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.860]   But maybe you said that you've got an S4 waiting for you
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.260]   in France.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.620]   But maybe you want to just check out
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.820]   how much that Galaxy S3 could get you right now.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.700]   Go to gazelle.com.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.580]   There are 30-day quote means that you have time.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.460]   Lock it in now, though, because if you wait,
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.420]   that S3 is not getting more valuable.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.300]   I almost guarantee it.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.260]   Let's just see.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:23.820]   Tell me a little bit.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.380]   It's an unlocked S3.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.020]   Yes.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.580]   Samsung Galaxy S3 Factory unlocked.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.980]   D-D-D.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.060]   These are the only factory unlocked.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.540]   Here it is.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.500]   And is it the GTI-9300?
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.420]   Absolutely.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.500]   It's not the mini.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.060]   No, no.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.020]   No, no.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.540]   And what condition would you say that's in?
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.420]   It's good.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.380]   It's good condition, says Cedric.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.180]   By the way, if it's better than good,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.300]   how'd you do that so fast?
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.220]   I'm still clicking buttons, and he's already got it.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.220]   160 bucks?
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:53.980]   That's pretty good.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.100]   Here in the States, you're only $40 away
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.860]   from getting your Galaxy S4.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.980]   What a two-year contract.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.340]   Oh, you want unlocked?
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.420]   You don't want your pay for this?
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:02.860]   No.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.620]   700?
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.220]   800.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.380]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.620]   But at least I had some help from gazelle.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.020]   I took all my old phones.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.140]   See, if they're sitting in the drawer,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.860]   they're not worth anything getting dusty.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.340]   No.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.980]   So take your old stuff.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.660]   Go to gazelle.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.700]   Get a quote.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:22.860]   iPhones, galaxies, Blackberries, even iPads, iPads, Macbooks.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.060]   Get a quote.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.100]   They pay the postage on anything more than a buck.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.660]   They'll wipe the data off it for you.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.900]   They'll even look at the quality.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.380]   And if you say, hey, it's good and they say it's excellent,
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.740]   they'll actually give you more money.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.060]   I've never heard of any company doing that.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.580]   150 bucks for your old iPhone 4, not even the 4S.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.540]   16 gigabytes.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.100]   Unbelievable.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.180]   Would they buy a Z10?
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.180]   Sorry, carry on.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.220]   The new Blackberry?
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.340]   You're ready to sell it already?
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.060]   Well, I'm not ready to use it.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.020]   Yeah, I had a Z10.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:53.740]   Do they have the Z10?
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.100]   They probably do one there.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:55.820]   It's pretty new.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:56.460]   No, they don't.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.100]   They only have the bold.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.220]   The bold.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.140]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.540]   They've paid over $100 million to over half a million
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.860]   customers of the last few years.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.260]   By the way, little pro tip.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.740]   You can get a check, PayPal.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.980]   But I would recommend getting the Amazon gift card
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.540]   because they bump at 5%.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.980]   Get some money for that stuff.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.980]   Look, 200 bucks for that third generation, not even the fourth.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.540]   Third generation iPad, 32 gigs Wi-Fi,
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.180]   is actually kind of a fun game to play.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.820]   How much is the crap in your closet worth?
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:30.540]   Gazelle.com.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.300]   And they do have the Z10.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.340]   They do?
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:33.980]   Yeah, they do.
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.140]   I'm calculating $237.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.900]   I'm red laughing all the way to the bank.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.820]   No, I think if you're in the Blackberry world,
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.660]   the Z10's fine.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.860]   I'm looking for the Q10's.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.220]   The Q10.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.380]   I think you want a keyboard.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.220]   Absolutely.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.460]   Because that's the kind of guy Blackberry guys are.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.820]   There's never been a better keyboard than the Blackberry
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.340]   keyboard.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.060]   Have you played with the Q10 yet?
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:59.100]   Well, imagine a bold with a touch screen and a new system.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.020]   I like the new OS.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:02.860]   But I'm just not--
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.900]   I have used the Blackberry since 2007
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.980]   when the iPhone came down.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.580]   That was the end for me.
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.860]   It was like, OK, see you.
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.660]   But then I thought there was no market for that.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.620]   But then I found myself in a flight to New York.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.660]   And when we landed, the six guys on my left all--
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.180]   Blackberrys.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.700]   --that Blackberrys.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.900]   Yeah, I was like, ah, there is still a market for that.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.540]   Government, businesses, absolutely.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.980]   And even kids who are into the BBM,
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.780]   if you're in the Blackberry messenger world,
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.620]   you got it.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:30.340]   You're locked in.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.300]   You got to have a Blackberry.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.300]   So let's talk a little bit of Apple.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:39.420]   Lots of Apple rumors.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.980]   We are kind of-- isn't this when the iPhone--
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   Ryan, you follow this.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.500]   Isn't this when the iPhone would be announced right about now?
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.420]   Isn't June iPhone month--
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.700]   It used to be June.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.780]   Last year, they bumped it into the fall.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.860]   Oh, that's right.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.140]   So they'll probably keep on doing the fall revisions.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:04.780]   What we'll get is new iOS at WWDC and probably new OS 10.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.980]   But definitely a new iOS at WWDC.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.220]   And then that will launch on the new device this fall.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.420]   Rumors for Apple stuff are notoriously terrible.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.340]   But we are starting to hear iPad mini retina rumors.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.180]   That would make sense.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:25.380]   But I mean, the fact that WWDC opens on the day when E3 opens.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.180]   It's the same day?
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.780]   It's the same day.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.300]   So how much can we expect?
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.700]   Oh.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.860]   They must know that all the press will be covering gaming.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.380]   I don't know.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.620]   Or they just don't care.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.540]   Or they don't care.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.980]   Now, never attribute to Malice what
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.580]   can also be explained by incompetence.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.940]   Or I guess in this case, just inability to plan.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.620]   These things get booked years in advance.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.300]   To book the Moscone Center for a week,
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.500]   you booked that years in advance.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.500]   It's just bad poor coincidence.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.340]   There are a lot of trade shows that happen.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.060]   And it was bound to happen at some point.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.540]   Why is it, though, that they don't announce the date--
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.740]   even though they must know the date,
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.780]   they don't announce the date till later?
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.860]   I guess they want to wait for tickets.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.180]   I don't understand it.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:07.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.980]   I've never planned an event of that scale.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.980]   But I know that there are two.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.620]   Probably because there are definitely reasons not to.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.740]   I mean, we don't even announce that the gadget live dates
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.060]   when we know what they are.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.620]   Oh, really?
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.120]   Why not?
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.060]   Wouldn't you want to let it rain out?
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.580]   What I was going to say is because there are sometimes
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.460]   like last minute event venue changes that happen.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.100]   We've had things where like three, four weeks in advance.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.580]   They'll bump us like a day or two.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.140]   And then we have to scramble.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.700]   Just all kinds of crap happens.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.780]   I have no idea why.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.900]   But it sometimes is best to hedge.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.100]   Superman in our chat room says, oh, no, Leo, you got it wrong.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.140]   Apple will get all the coverage, and that'll hurt E3.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.100]   Well, I mean, I don't know.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.340]   E3, we got a new Xbox.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.740]   We got a new--
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.940]   If you're a tech reporter today, what do you do?
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.540]   You know that's going to be a new Xbox E3.
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.420]   You don't know what's going to be a WWDC.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.780]   If it's just an upgrade to an update to iOS,
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.980]   then you book your ticket to LA.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.060]   But you don't know?
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:57:59.980]   No.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.380]   So you know that there will be a new Xbox to touch and play with.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.700]   I think E3 is going to be the big show this year.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.180]   Hopefully it's going to be a big E3, the biggest E3 in years.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.900]   Well, we'll learn more about the PS4.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.020]   They'll be the new Xbox.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.220]   Lots of good games.
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:13.700]   Watchmen.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:19.020]   So watchmen looks really, really, really interesting.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.140]   You'll have to talk to my side.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.300]   It's like you give them about that.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.860]   Do you love it?
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.460]   Have you played with it?
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.740]   No, yeah.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.220]   We saw a little more of--
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:30.180]   we saw a kind of a walkthrough a couple of days ago.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.660]   This is the game that is-- it's free play.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.780]   But everything is hackable in your world.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.020]   You're in New York City.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:37.020]   You can hack ATMs.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.380]   You can hack people.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.060]   Apparently, they've talked to security companies
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.740]   to make the hacking like real world.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.820]   This is awesome.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.700]   This is going to be the most of the hack that's ready.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.060]   You're going to be the witchman.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:53.300]   Is Veronica Gekin out of her watchman?
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.580]   She hasn't mentioned it to me, actually.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:55.660]   She's been playing a lot of sims.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.700]   It's watched dogs, guys.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.780]   Watch dogs.
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.140]   Absolutely.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.020]   Watchmen's the comic.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.220]   Watch dogs.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.620]   Thank you.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.300]   By the way, you really can hack ATMs in New York City,
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.220]   apparently.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.260]   No, it's not.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.380]   This is better than fiction.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.220]   It's not just fiction.
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:18.740]   This is perhaps the largest bank robbery.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:25.700]   Every $45 million in New York City ATMs in ours.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.300]   Eight residents of Yonkers have been indicted.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   But those are just the bag been.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.260]   It was a global heist, which occurred on December 22nd.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:44.500]   The deal was that apparently the hackers who did this,
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.140]   and we don't know where they're from,
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.140]   targeted debit cards issued by the United Arab Emirates
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:56.820]   Bank, the UAE Bank, dispatched carders in about 20 countries,
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:01.580]   4,500 ATM transactions in just a few hours.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.380]   Actually, New York was only $400,000
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.500]   in 750 transactions from 150 different ATMs,
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.700]   two hours and 25 minutes.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:15.220]   Then a second operation, which happened February 19, $40 million
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.420]   in 36,000 transactions.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.340]   In 10 hours, the Yonkers group allegedly
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.060]   withdrew about $2 and 1/2 million in just a few hours.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.020]   Wow.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.460]   We're in the wrong line of business.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.460]   Wow.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.260]   One of the indicted debt defendants
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.460]   was murdered in the Dominican Republic last month.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.780]   This is a movie, isn't it?
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.100]   There's going to be a movie.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.180]   I'm sure the rights have already been optioned.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.180]   By whom?
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.140]   Well, it's funny.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:49.860]   I was talking to Dana Brunetti, who is a great producer,
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.860]   just produced--
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.300]   he did the social network.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.940]   He works with Kevin Spacey.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.580]   They just did House of Cards.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   And we interviewed him on triangulation.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.940]   And he was talking about when the Navy SEALs rescued
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:08.540]   the captain who was hijacked by Somali pirates.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.100]   And he's watching on CNN.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.980]   He's on the phone before the CNN report
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.260]   is over to option the rights.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.100]   And they just finished making that movie, by the way.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.260]   So it happens that when Hollywood reads this story,
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.420]   it's already-- you're exactly right.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.300]   It's already optioned.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.580]   It was option two days ago, I'm sure.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.700]   If you could find the person to option it from.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:31.620]   I would like to see more-- unfortunately,
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.580]   they're focusing on all of this.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:37.500]   I'd like to see more about how the hackers did it.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.820]   You want the exploit?
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.940]   I want the exploit.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.540]   You want the zero day.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.380]   They use teams of what they call cashers who encode
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.540]   magnetic stripe cards like gift cards with a compromised
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.220]   card data.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.900]   So they target databases of prepaid debit cards.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:01.580]   They breach the debit card account security protocols.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.220]   And that's why they focus on some banks are probably a little
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.020]   easier to hack than others.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.580]   They change the withdrawal limits to make it maximum.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.060]   And that's, by the way, there are ATMs apparently not in the
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.660]   US, but in some countries where you can get as much as $10,000
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:15.660]   in cash.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.300]   What?
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.020]   That's not a good idea.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.460]   It seems--
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.900]   I bet that changes.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.300]   So they eliminate withdrawal limits, which enables the
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.500]   participants to withdraw unlimited amounts of cash
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.020]   until the operation is shut down.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.460]   Then they distribute these credit card numbers, not the
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:32.940]   cards.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.500]   They just get online.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.060]   And they get these cashers who encode the cards.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:44.020]   Opop-Sci has a good article on popular science to the
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.660]   rescue on this.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.780]   Let me click the link.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.420]   What an amazing story.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.260]   So it can be done.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.780]   That's just because you haven't moved to chip and pin yet.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.020]   Now see, in France, I couldn't use my credit card.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.820]   I couldn't get gas because I had an American credit card that
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:01.740]   didn't have a chip in it.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.380]   Smart, absolutely.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.060]   It was a dumb card, not a smart card.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.900]   But I mean, we've had problems with chip and pin in the
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.340]   past.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.700]   You just had that, baby.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.460]   14, 15 years ago, I did a story from some guy on the
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.380]   internet said, do you want to make a fake card?
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.420]   I said, sure, on TV, meaning.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.860]   And he sent me a little file.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.780]   I programmed on a chip.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.660]   And I could just use my fake card for anything and type any
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.060]   pin.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   And it would always work.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.460]   I trust you didn't do that.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.780]   I used it for two things.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.380]   I made a phone call and a phone booth with it just to check
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   that it worked.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:35.620]   And then I went in the metro and bought myself some tickets
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:38.340]   that are still in a safe somewhere and get to get to
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:38.340]   get to.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.060]   I hope you had Guillaume with a camera.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.780]   Guillaume wasn't there at the time.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.700]   He was smart.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.100]   But the story only made it to her because this was summer and
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.420]   the legal department of the TF only had interns.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.940]   Because they were like the lawyers would never have
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.580]   laid.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.620]   They were like, you're putting the card in the thing and it's
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.780]   getting tickets out.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.660]   Yes.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.340]   But that's illegal.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:00.420]   So it's still there.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.540]   But you're doing it.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.180]   There's a law for that, the journalists.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.860]   She'll just want to get the truth out.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.940]   Cedric still hasn't explained now how he owns that Bugatti.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:15.140]   All righty.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.740]   Lucia Nye-- Lucia.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.020]   No, Guillaume Nye 28.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:20.780]   Is now official.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.580]   We've seen the ads.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.500]   It'll have pure review.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.940]   It'll have optical image stabilization of Carl Zeiss camera.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.700]   It was a magazine ad that leaked it.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.180]   And Gadget has an article about-- what do you think, Ryan Block?
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.740]   Do you have you used Windows phones at all?
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.100]   I don't think it was a leak.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.060]   No, it wasn't a leak.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.340]   It was in the magazine.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:44.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.540]   Vanity Fair.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.060]   They knew it was going to be out.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.140]   That was highly controlled.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.780]   And I'm sure there was literally zero mystery about the fact
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.540]   that it was going to be in Vanity Fair.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:56.940]   And Vanity Fair would be the venue by which people
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.420]   heard about this for the first time.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.620]   They're making a statement.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.540]   The statement is this is a phone for people
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.900]   where they-- a different class of taste.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.660]   This is better than an iPhone.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.220]   So we thought originally that this would be just a special version
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.500]   of the 920 for Verizon.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.580]   But it sounds like it is a whole new--
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.380]   it's aluminum unibody, right?
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.420]   Or aluminum case?
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.900]   Yeah, I think the question is, can they
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:26.180]   do anything to make this more desirable than, say,
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.620]   your HTC One or your Galaxy S4 or S3 or an iPhone?
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.780]   I don't know, man.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:39.180]   I just don't-- I don't see them winning this way.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.620]   Or do I see them winning with--
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.460]   I really like that new ad they've been playing, where it's like,
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.500]   oh, the Android people and the Apple people
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.180]   hate each other.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.620]   And so smart people who want to stay out of it
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.940]   and just have a good phone are just using Windows Phone 8.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:58.060]   But none of this is like, why do I need to have this?
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.620]   What is so great about this that I have to have it instead
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.420]   of a really good Android phone or a really good iPhone?
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.740]   Is it too-- is it just that it's too late that people have
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.140]   already chosen one or the other?
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.460]   I think it's always just about what is the best product.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.300]   I think if they--
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.140]   So they would switch if they could convince you
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.940]   of the value of doing that.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.540]   I have to believe that anybody who
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:25.420]   makes the best product in its class is going to win
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.020]   at any given time, because upgrade cycles on phones,
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.500]   as we all know, are only about two years.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.300]   I would switch to-- I have no problem switching
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.020]   to a Windows Phone.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.420]   It's just, OK, so there are some app issues there, right?
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.140]   But like, platform is not so much better,
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.740]   or so much more efficient, or easy to use,
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.060]   that it's worth the switching cost.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:44.420]   Right.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.820]   It's that old thing of incremental,
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.140]   even if it's marginally better than something
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.900]   that already exists, you're not going
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.220]   to make the effort of switching.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:56.100]   I don't think the game is over, and it's
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.500]   going to be Android and iOS until the end of times.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.500]   But someone has to come up with something
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.940]   that makes you want to switch, which is different and new
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.140]   and exciting and interesting enough, or just simply
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.580]   functional enough, that is going to convince you,
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.380]   and clearly, Windows Phone 8 is not that.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.620]   Is it the ecosystem?
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.420]   I mean, they announced this week that there are 145,000 apps
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.380]   now.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.300]   That should be good enough.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.660]   I'm going to-- there's a program I'm
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.500]   going to download called Switch to Windows Phone.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.220]   In Android?
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.500]   And the point of it is, you run this app,
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.380]   and it tells you how many of your apps
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.740]   that you're using on your Android phone
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.780]   are available on Windows Phone.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.780]   Pray tell.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.660]   Do you have the same app for iOS?
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.260]   Just kidding.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:43.660]   I don't know.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.940]   Look, Switch to Windows Phone.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.980]   Let me open it and just see.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:52.580]   It'll go through my parse my apps license terms.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.020]   Thank you.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:53.900]   Yes, I agree.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.580]   We're here to make your Switch to Windows Phone
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.140]   as quick and easy as possible.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.660]   Thank you.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.340]   Thanks, really, really nice of you.
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.260]   No, no, continue.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.380]   We're checking the Windows Phone Store for your apps.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.820]   We'll let you know which ones are available.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.140]   So I guess this might take a while.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:12.140]   So--
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.060]   Yeah, once again, it's a nice effort
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.460]   that I applaud Microsoft for doing something like that.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.500]   It's inventive.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.940]   But who's going to go through the trouble of how?
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.140]   Doing that.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.180]   And if you're going to get the apps that you have on your Android
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:32.100]   phone anyway already, why would you
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.620]   go and seek out a different system, a different phone,
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.660]   switch everything?
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.140]   Well, it reassures some people.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.100]   I mean, at least I'll be able to--
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.740]   so we matched 80% of your apps in the Windows Phone Store,
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.820]   including these favorites.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.020]   And it's showing the different favorite apps here.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   Next, we'll save the full app list in the cloud
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.100]   and send you instructions on how to get the apps in your new
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.020]   phone.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.100]   You got to admire them.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.580]   It's going to be stuff like this that might help people
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.420]   over the hump.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]   Sure.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   Because that's one of the fears.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.980]   It's like, oh, but am I going to have to help us?
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.140]   Am I going to have this and that?
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.940]   Unfortunately, now I have to sign into my Microsoft.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.380]   Is there a Kindle reader?
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:12.020]   The problem is this addresses one of two--
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.180]   sorry, sorry, go ahead.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:13.900]   Oh, go ahead, Ryan.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.540]   Please.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.980]   Well, I was going to say this addresses one of two problems.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.700]   The first problem is how many of the apps that I already
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.580]   have are on this other platform?
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.940]   And that's a big problem.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.580]   That's a big fear.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.700]   But to me, the bigger problem is the next cool app that comes out,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.420]   where's that coming out first?
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.700]   Well, it's probably coming out for iOS.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.060]   There's this chance-- there's possibility it's coming out
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:35.900]   for Android.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.820]   There's zero possibility it's coming out for Windows 5.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.580]   Unless it's Microsoft Office.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.500]   Oh, Scott.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.460]   Right.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.380]   But what you're saying, Ryan, is completely true.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:52.420]   It addresses that question of, does that platform have the apps
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.340]   I want?
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.140]   But in order to even ask yourself that question,
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.860]   you need to pay it to want that other phone, right?
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.980]   So you need to be convinced already, have convinced already.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.180]   And I don't see these phones doing that, unfortunately,
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.220]   for Microsoft.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.820]   Well, the pure view photo things on the latest Nokia's
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.540]   are, you know, if you see what it does as a camera,
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.860]   it's absolutely beautiful.
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.540]   And that's the point where you actually
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.540]   ask yourself the questions.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.980]   Like, can I really switch?
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.660]   Will it have my apps?
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.100]   I guess the point of all this is just to reassure you.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.380]   It's like, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.900]   You'll live.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.380]   I wish you'd show me what apps it doesn't have.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.220]   It's SLR quality.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.100]   It's almost SLR, really?
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.820]   No, that was a terrible joke about how they kind of face
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.220]   that demo.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.180]   Oh, that's right.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.220]   There's an SLR.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.980]   I have to say, the HTC One has a really nice camera.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.100]   I mean, it does a very nice job.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.060]   I'm a little like--
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.140]   I would say it's as good as--
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.900]   How's the camera on the S4?
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.700]   Not so good.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.180]   Oh, really?
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.420]   Well, it's OK.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.900]   It's not horrible.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.180]   It's pretty good.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.500]   It has a lot of weird modes.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:56.700]   Oh.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.740]   You know, a lot of weird--
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.900]   Too many options.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:10:59.860]   Future creative.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.100]   Well, you don't have to use those options, I guess.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:03.980]   By the way, I'm sorry.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.900]   I'm logging into my Outlook account
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.420]   so I could save the list of apps.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   This is like 18 steps later.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.500]   I gave up a long time ago, but for you,
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.220]   I'm going to finish this.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.540]   I now have to get an email verifying
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.580]   that this phone is, in fact, part of my Outlook.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.380]   We'll just move on for the time being.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:30.980]   Oh, by the way, one other point about 145,000 apps.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.540]   That sounds good, but it's only 5,000 more apps
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.620]   than the last time they mentioned this a few months ago.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.820]   So it's not growing super fast.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.940]   It doesn't have to be 1,000 as long as--
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.420]   The right fast.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.900]   The 15 you won't are in there.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.420]   No, you're right.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.740]   So that's why I almost wish you would say what it doesn't have.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.540]   Exactly.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:51.340]   Microsoft rumor to be looking at buying Nook.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   Microsoft made a big investment into Barnes and Noble Nook
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.060]   platform.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.620]   Several hundred million dollars, as I remember,
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:01.020]   was a significant investment causing
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.800]   us to joke about Microsoft releasing
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.500]   a Wook, a Windows-based Nook.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:11.460]   Now they're offering a billion dollars to buy this business.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.740]   This is odd, given that the Nook is, in fact,
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.580]   showing a real erosion.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.620]   It can't be for the hardware.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.020]   Well, I have a theory about this.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.660]   Microsoft and Barnes and Noble, by the way, are not confirming.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:29.340]   But when they get the Nook, they get more than the Nook hardware.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:34.460]   They get Nook Media, which includes, interestingly enough,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.580]   the textbook, the E textbook business,
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.140]   and a bunch of stores in colleges.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.380]   And I think Microsoft's retail strategy
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.580]   does call for more stores.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:50.420]   I think the textbook business is not a bad business.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.740]   I doubt very much they want the Nook.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.540]   I don't think it's going to make money for them.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.300]   Not only are they day late, but they're
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:56.780]   going to come in.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.740]   They're going to way over pay on this thing.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.820]   Or something that's ultimately not
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.900]   going to do anything for them.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.580]   It's a classic, classic move that makes no sense.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.260]   But I mean, they must have come to--
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.420]   They have all the makes no sense strategy.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.740]   Yes, some are not good at that.
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:16.460]   But I mean, they must have come to the realization that,
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:21.540]   e-readers, not tablets, but Nooks and Kindles and whatnot,
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.180]   are not really a long-term investment strategy.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:27.660]   But that may be publishing it forever.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.980]   And this is what they're buying, apart from a few stores
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.060]   on college campuses.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:36.660]   Aren't they buying the licensing and the assets and all of that?
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.380]   Couldn't they make a bookstore, an iBookstore out of it?
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.420]   They could make a Windows Phone 8 reader.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:43.900]   Right.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.380]   Exactly.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.900]   So I mean, not even-- yeah, a reader and an app.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   And they sell music and video for whoever
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.420]   wants to buy from them.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.580]   So books would make sense to add to that collection.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.980]   Is it Mother's Day in France?
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:13:59.740]   Nope.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.100]   If it is, I'm in big trouble.
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.180]   Is there a reason--
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.820]   Is there a Mother's Day?
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.460]   Of course we do.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.140]   There's some reason it's a few.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.820]   It's a couple of weeks apart.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.940]   I scared you.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.220]   Oh, boy.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.180]   Why did I have to say hello to our moms?
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:16.860]   Hi, Mom.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.580]   Actually, funny thing is I was texting with my mom this morning
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.980]   because she was having a problem with her iPad.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.940]   And she listens to your radio show.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.380]   And she was cracking up.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.700]   She's like, Leo's going to think I'm so dumb because I didn't
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.540]   reboot my iPad.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.980]   You know, it's funny because my mom, I gave her a Galaxy Note
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.980]   2 while she was out here last month.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.820]   And so for the first-- it's her first smartphone.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.620]   So I first time she's texting.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.860]   And I'm kicking myself.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.380]   Why?
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:43.180]   Because I get a lot of texts from her.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.380]   We were texting back and forth about Facebook
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.100]   because I try to create a Facebook account that's
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:52.100]   completely anonymous for her so that she could see what
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.020]   the grandkids are up to because they're all on Facebook.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.420]   I mean, if you have a Facebook account,
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.380]   you really can follow them.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:01.260]   And so she said, well, it knows my age.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.100]   And I said, well, don't worry.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.140]   No one else can see that.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.260]   That's you.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.020]   It was an ongoing.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.620]   And then-- and by the way, she's pretty savvy.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:13.740]   She said, I can't watch you anymore.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:17.260]   My Mac says, you need Flash.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:17.820]   I had it.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.220]   I watched you last week.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.140]   And Apple does this.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:20.900]   It's very interesting.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.460]   Apple has-- they put out a P-list that's automatically
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:26.780]   updated of software that you can't run because it's got
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.620]   malware.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.060]   And if your Flash is too old on the Mac platform, it won't
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.820]   let you run it.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.420]   But it doesn't really give you a good handle on what to do.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.860]   But what you need to do is upgrade Flash.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.380]   So then I had to walk her via SMS.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.420]   Walkers?
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.100]   Walkers through upgrading Flash.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:42.980]   Boy, that was fun.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.220]   The things you do for your mom.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.620]   She said, it's very expensive.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.700]   I said, no, no, get the free Flash player.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.420]   It's on the--
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.700]   And she said, is 11.7 the right version?
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.220]   I said, yes, get that.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.460]   That was very fun.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.260]   Happy Mother's Day.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.060]   I love your mom.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.500]   I love you.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.060]   And she has now a Sprint Galaxy Note 2.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:01.900]   She's loving it.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.460]   She likes the S Pen.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.420]   She draws.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.820]   Like that.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.340]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Patrick
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.540]   Bejia is here.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:12.220]   What should we plug, Patrick, for you?
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.020]   What's your--
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.500]   I know you do a movie podcast.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.300]   You do a news-- you do a French twit, basically.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:18.940]   Well, yeah.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.460]   I actually stopped my English podcasts
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.140]   to focus on the French ones.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.860]   And I still do, however, the--
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.540]   I have two.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:31.820]   The Tech News Show, which is called Le Ronde vous tech.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.620]   And an app recommendation show, which is called Appload.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.540]   So if you enjoy Frenchness and Tech News,
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.220]   you should go check those out.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.540]   I'm sorry to hear that you stopped the English language.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.100]   Actually, I'm not.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.900]   I'm very happy because I didn't like the competition.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.020]   But--
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.660]   So they might come back.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.260]   It makes sense, though.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.620]   People are going to-- that's where you can have a real niche.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.060]   You'll find it on nowatch.net, right?
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:58.420]   No?
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.060]   Exactly.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.220]   And a bunch of other shows there.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:01.620]   What?
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.820]   What's Cedric?
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.180]   Ask him.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.500]   We have no watch.net.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.380]   No, it is no watch.net.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:12.540]   But we are actually kind of stopping operations at no watch.net.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.500]   I can't get in current on your story because I'm all messed up.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.980]   You know, it was a very interesting adventure.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.260]   But the sponsors are not as willing as they are,
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.380]   and open-minded as they are in the Americas.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:35.380]   So yeah, we're all going back to our own homes.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.740]   But the shows are continuing.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.180]   So that's the--
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:40.420]   No, it's actually challenging.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.460]   We have the same problem here.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:42.980]   It's a few--
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:43.460]   Oh, really?
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.780]   Have you seen the studio?
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.660]   Well, maybe not quite to that degree.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.420]   But a lot of the big advertisers just
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.340]   don't think podcasts are real.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.580]   They don't think it's new media is real in any way.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.820]   So I'll give you an example, which is Ford, which we love,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:59.140]   and is a great sponsor.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.460]   But we talked to them the other day.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:06.140]   They said, yeah, we're done with our podcast experiment.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:06.780]   Was it working?
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.860]   Oh, yeah, we get great results.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.300]   But we're done with that.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.140]   And the problem is not results.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:15.380]   The problem is, hey, we got to buy ads on NBC.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.860]   You're only a million bucks here or there.
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.540]   It's not a big deal.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.020]   We need to spend $100 million to make it really worth our while.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.500]   That's-- we got a few sponsors that actually trusted us
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.420]   and invested in our shows.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.180]   And they got great results.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:31.980]   The--
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.180]   It works.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.300]   Yeah, it works really well.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:39.060]   People remember that what's the term in English--
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:39.940]   Rick, when call.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:40.820]   Unaided recall.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:45.340]   Unaided recall is amazing, though, as you very well know.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:47.380]   But for some reason, it's not--
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.660]   Well, that's what's interesting to me,
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:50.780]   that even though it works, it's just--
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.260]   I think these are all agents-- for the most part, agency
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.660]   buys on these big companies.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.140]   And I think the agency is-- it's not a big enough buy,
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.940]   so they don't get a big enough commission.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:18:59.980]   And it's a little risky.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.260]   And it's a little harder for them.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.820]   They have to explain to the company, well,
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.940]   we're going to buy this stuff.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.860]   It's independent media.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:08.900]   It's not-- it's the old line.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.780]   Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.020]   No ad agency ever got fired for buying CBS.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:20.180]   It's a simple, easy kind of thing.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.500]   And so I think while you're probably
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.540]   right that French ad agencies are even more conservative,
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.740]   there still is that conservatism in our business.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:29.100]   Sure.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:29.940]   Then I hope we'll change it.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:32.140]   Yeah, they also have big numbers to hit, too.
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:32.980]   They're going to hit lots.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.860]   Yeah, I saw this at gadget.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.740]   We see we deal with this at AOL.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:39.420]   It's not about the quality of the product or even the results.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.580]   Even if you get really great conversion,
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.180]   their job is to buy ad impressions
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.860]   for hundreds of millions of page views,
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.980]   or tens of millions of audience members per week.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:55.260]   And it's really, really hard to make even the best possible
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:59.260]   conversion on a much smaller scale count.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.220]   Right.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.700]   No, I understand.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.700]   But we don't even do as well as banners and web pages.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.180]   They kind of get that now.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:11.380]   But we're just a newer thing, and it's even harder for them.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.260]   It's super frustrating.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:15.420]   Somebody should roll all that up and figure out a way to--
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.060]   I'm patient.
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:16.580]   I'm patient.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.540]   Because what's also happening-- and we know this,
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.140]   as I mentioned earlier, television ads don't work.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.820]   So what's happening is they're really casting around it
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.140]   for better ways to get to the audience.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.820]   And eventually they'll find this.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.140]   We're doing all right.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.180]   It's not like we're starving by any means.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.180]   But--
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:35.740]   Certainly the real question, what everyone's wondering about
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.260]   is how do you do those awesome CPMs?
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.180]   Yeah, the high numbers.
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.020]   Because we're worth it.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.940]   It wouldn't work if you didn't get a return on the investment.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.300]   So we charge a lot of money for ads on these shows.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.500]   We only do a handful of them.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.140]   I know it feels like probably to the audience that we do a lot.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.900]   But we only do one per half hour at most.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.780]   I mean, I'm from radio where it's 19 minutes every hour
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:01.380]   on the radio show, 19 minutes an hour of ads.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:06.940]   So half an hour every couple of minutes every half hour is nothing.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.180]   I'm patient.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:10.780]   I'm nothing if I'm not patient.
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.700]   And General Motors, don't worry, we're coming to you.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.940]   So it's like a Don Draper on Mad Men.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.540]   You've got to have a car.
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.180]   Our show today brought to you by one of our big supporters,
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:23.900]   actually Citrix.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.380]   The folks at Citrix are believers.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.580]   In fact, you'll see them on lots of podcasts on lots of websites
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.300]   because they know this stuff works.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:35.140]   And let's be fair, they're selling a more technical product.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:38.940]   They need a more technical audience.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.220]   And so I'm really grateful to them for really supporting
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.540]   what we do.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:45.260]   This is a product.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.860]   Perfect example.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.180]   You're never going to see this on NBC.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.380]   But I'll tell you, if you're a geek,
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.780]   if you're a support professional or an IT guy,
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.140]   this is the product you've got to know about.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.340]   Go to assist.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.260]   You probably know about it because it's the number one
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.780]   remote support solution.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.460]   Has been for the last 10 years.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.700]   But what I love about Citrix is they add features
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.380]   all the time.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.980]   Now, not only do they have the best remote support--
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.300]   I was doing this with my mom, by the way.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.540]   Unattended support, Mac to PC, PC to Mac, mobile devices.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.740]   You can support people from an iPad.
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.340]   But also, they've got a service desk,
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:18.900]   which allows you to manage track and resolve issues.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.620]   You've got a release and configuration management built in.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.820]   You've got a beautiful-- if you're an independent provider,
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.380]   you want to be a managed services provider,
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.100]   they have a portal that's branded for you,
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.660]   a white label portal that looks fabulous.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.820]   And then the monitoring is something I'm really kind of
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:34.420]   thrilled about.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.220]   We've installed that on our network.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.540]   It goes out, crawls the network, looks at all the hardware
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.460]   and the software.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.780]   You've got a complete inventory of everything.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.020]   And then with point and click, you
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.220]   can set up trackers that keep an eye on things
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.220]   like network performance, even things like hard drive space,
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.500]   toner cartridges.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.860]   So you get texts or emails or instant messages
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.180]   when there's a problem.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.460]   So you can fix it before the problem becomes a problem.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.220]   And all of that goes to you being like a support hero,
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.620]   somebody who's really making a difference for your clients.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.180]   A great solution for anyone.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.020]   I want you to try it free.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.860]   And you can try all three modules for free for 30 days.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.740]   When you visit gotoassist.com, click the try it free button.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.340]   And when you do, you'll notice there's a link
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:19.220]   that you need to click that says, what's the promo code?
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.380]   And I want you to click that and enter in the promo code of--
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.300]   Twit C right here says promo code.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.900]   Just put TWIT in there, if you would, just so that they know.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.300]   That's another thing we do to let--
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.300]   we couldn't do that with Ford.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:36.140]   Click a Mustang and tell them to it, saying.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.820]   But they even said this.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:41.220]   We get more email, more tweets.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.820]   People saying, I bought it, just saw it in the chat.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.980]   Or before people said, I bought a Ford because of you.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:45.820]   So I think it works.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.860]   We'll get them back.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.380]   Thank you, Citrix, for your support.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.340]   Go toassist.com, the offer code is TWIT.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.540]   I would love that.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.860]   So as long as we're talking about crazy purchase ideas,
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.980]   and apparently $1 billion is now what it costs to buy a company.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.060]   It's standard.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.620]   It's just $1 billion.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:07.900]   Facebook, according to TechCrunch, is looking at ways.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.980]   We heard last that Apple was courting ways, right?
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:14.100]   And TechCrunch says $1 billion.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.980]   Will Facebook buy ways?
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.220]   Anybody buy that?
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.300]   Doesn't know.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.540]   Facebook has so much money they can buy anything.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.180]   That is true.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.260]   You know, I wouldn't put it past them.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.300]   It seems a little weird because they're just
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.660]   so in different worlds, right?
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.380]   Ways is-- I mean, I guess you've got social.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.780]   It's the word social.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.780]   But I mean, if you've ever used ways, it's not really social.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.980]   It's just there are other people on the map.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.140]   You just see people on the map.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.780]   It's nothing social about it the way that Facebook is social.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.900]   It's just a traffic app.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.060]   It's like a traffic beacon and data app.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:52.300]   And they're all about traffic data and mapping.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.180]   And that's a great product.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.020]   I use it all the time.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:55.780]   I love ways.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.020]   It has nothing to do with Facebook.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.140]   I mean, at least Instagram, you could say, OK, Facebook, one
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.980]   of their primary use cases is photos.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:05.980]   They need to retain dominance in the photo space.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.220]   Instagram equals photos on the phone.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.860]   So clearly owning Instagram means
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.340]   that they're taking out one of their biggest long-term
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.020]   competitors in mobile.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.180]   Ways it's just there's-- I don't even see it.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.060]   But who knows?
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.100]   I mean, Facebook's got to buy somebody, right?
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.660]   Facebook wants location, though, right?
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.620]   I mean, location's very important to Facebook mobile.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:26.980]   Is it?
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.380]   I mean, they kind of got rid of their location stuff.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:29.740]   What?
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.140]   Don't you check in?
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:31.780]   You're in a check in?
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.700]   On Facebook?
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.900]   Oh.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.340]   They took it out?
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:35.860]   No, you can't.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.340]   I don't think they did.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:36.980]   Just look in.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.100]   I'm pretty sure you can.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.660]   Yeah, whenever I put most of picture on Facebook,
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.740]   it has a button that says, where are you?
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.980]   And no, I think they want to--
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.660]   I mean, look, this is where the money is.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:47.860]   It's social.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.780]   Social and local, right?
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.660]   Location is--
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:54.700]   I mean, Waze has like 47 million users.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.700]   But what if you took Waze--
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.740]   No, not so it's used to having ads,
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.020]   because it's that supported?
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.140]   When I log into Waze, I log in through Facebook.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.140]   It uses Facebook Connect.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.220]   So it's tied in it.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.620]   And it looks up my friends.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.980]   But what if you could have Waze not just
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.420]   for driving down the freeway, but for the streets too?
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.060]   Because that would be-- that's one thing Google Maps does
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.060]   that I think is great is it has walking and cycling
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.300]   and transit directions.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.300]   Maybe that's how you can enhance.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.140]   And then you can actually extend it indoors to shut--
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.820]   See, I think there's something there.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.060]   By the way, Facebook has purchased at least
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.220]   to my knowledge two other--
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.660]   if Waze is Israeli, two other Israeli companies.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.060]   In fact, we had one of the developers from Snap 2
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.140]   in here last week.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:36.140]   That was a feature phone development company.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:39.620]   And the face.com they bought.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.860]   But some good stuff coming out of Israel,
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.380]   some of the most interesting software.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.820]   Is that because the government supports and funds it?
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.980]   Is it because-- why is so much good software coming out of it?
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.220]   They have awesome--
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:53.100]   Great developers.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.500]   Technology schools.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.020]   Schools.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.060]   The Daphneon in high fund and all that.
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:02.500]   There's like 50/50 funds where private investors will fund
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.980]   your company and the government will match it.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.260]   But it's inspired.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.580]   There's lots of that.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.300]   And--
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.740]   In France, do they do something?
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.380]   And when we go to the web, one of the things
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.460]   that's always bemoaning is that lack of the investment
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.260]   infrastructure that has really helped innovation in the US.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.700]   It's sort of true.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.700]   But still, there's a report that's
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.820]   supposed to be coming out.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.700]   And you'll see that says that Paris is the city in Europe
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.940]   that has the most startups.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.260]   And you see them everywhere.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.260]   There's incubators.
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:34.620]   There's lots and lots going on and events and all that.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.300]   But yes, they don't command the same kind of investments
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.620]   that startups can command in the US.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.620]   Or even in Israel, because Israel is a bit--
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.620]   it's like the 51st state, investment-wise.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.300]   It's good public policy.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:47.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.180]   I mean, right?
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.140]   I mean, it builds a tax base.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:53.020]   But you also should promote credit education, technical
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.060]   education.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.340]   And now we don't have startup users.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:59.940]   The government is paying very close attention to this,
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.780]   which is surprising.
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.940]   It's a left-wing government.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.180]   Socially, it's basically-- and they just
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.900]   announced a couple of weeks ago a series of measures
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:12.420]   that they're trying to implement to favor entrepreneurship
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.140]   in France.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:17.540]   And it covers a wide range of topics.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.140]   But there's certainly an appetite for it.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.340]   I'm not sure that the social fabric and the economic fabric
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:26.420]   of the country facilitates this enough.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.500]   And it's very cultural.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.700]   And I'm not sure it's easy to change that.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.820]   It's a little risk-averse.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.060]   I actually think it does.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.300]   I think one of the explanations is that, for example,
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.660]   if I get laid off tomorrow--
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.780]   let's hope it doesn't happen--
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.620]   I will get--
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.380]   I'm going to have to work again.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.460]   No.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.860]   I'll get unemployment coverage for least 18 months,
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.820]   during which I can start my own thing.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.820]   And lots of people are actually doing that.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:52.260]   Interesting.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.620]   Quitting that job or getting laid off.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.180]   And the state is sort of--
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.180]   The socialist system isn't necessarily
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.140]   incompatible with a fight where we would have to agree
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.700]   on what socialist means.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:03.740]   Well, a government--
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.500]   Doesn't mean the same thing in French.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.860]   A governmental safety net.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.900]   That's what we call it here.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.340]   Which, of course, is not socialism,
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.420]   but that's another matter entirely.
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.380]   All right, let's move on.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.500]   Adobe kills the creative suite.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.060]   You cannot buy Photoshop.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.780]   You must subscribe.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.500]   You Microsoft wanted to do this for years.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.980]   They still haven't been able to bite the bullet.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.340]   Is Adobe making a mistake or doing the right thing?
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.940]   Oh, people are going to scream.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:26.460]   They are.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:26.980]   They're already--
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.500]   They're already--
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.220]   But still, this is the way things are going.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.260]   But you know, software will be sold as a service.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:32.780]   And that's it.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.380]   They keep saying that their customers
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.020]   had such a positive response to this range.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:38.380]   And they couldn't believe in it.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:41.460]   This is years further down further head of schedule
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.660]   than they thought they would be in the progress towards moving
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:45.580]   everything to software as a service.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:50.180]   And oh, we can't believe how positive our customers have been.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.220]   Come on.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.020]   Seriously, you think anybody's buying that line?
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:53.420]   No.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.100]   It's a Wall Street-- I mean, apparently Wall Street bought
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:55.140]   that one.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.260]   Well, it's good for business because it's an annuity.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.660]   And I have to think that business does not put your--
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.340]   there's two different markets for Adobe's creative suite.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:05.060]   There's the individual graphic designer.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.100]   But I think probably the market that Adobe's looking about
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:10.740]   is the designer in a larger business.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:15.500]   The people who do your GDTT site or do the Engadget site,
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.980]   who are working in-house, instead of going to the boss
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.180]   and say, hey, boss, I need to buy a $2,500 piece of software.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.940]   They say, boss, we need to subscribe to this for $50 a month.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:27.900]   The boss is going to sign off on the $50 a month a lot faster.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.340]   Right?
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.100]   Easy.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.100]   Totally.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.260]   So I think that's what Adobe's thinking is
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:37.380]   the purchaser is not the same person as the person who's choosing.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.700]   And whatever is going to make it easiest-- and certainly,
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.180]   it's good for Adobe because it's all about piracy.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.980]   It's a way of preventing--
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.780]   I would assume preventing piracy.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:53.580]   Well, it might even-- there's a $10 option for the single software.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.860]   Like, if you want Photoshop, you can pay $10 a month.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.460]   $19 a month.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:57.940]   $20?
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:58.580]   $19, is it?
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:30:59.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:30:59.380]   OK.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.060]   Well, that's a little bit--
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.740]   But that's still 240 bucks a year.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.900]   That's less than buying a copy of Photoshop.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.060]   And maybe some people who would previously
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.980]   have used a pirated version might think, you know what?
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:12.140]   I'm going to get the latest version for $20.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.140]   Right.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.980]   It's a smaller number.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.220]   And it is-- I mean, if you bought a new copy of Photoshop
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.180]   every three years, it's about the same.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.820]   Yes, up until now, to get you to buy the new copy of Photoshop,
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:27.660]   they would have to put in new features and whatnot.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.700]   And actually get you a good reason to buy it now.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.700]   That's it.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.460]   You're just hooked.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:34.300]   Just coast along.
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.300]   $20 a month.
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:36.500]   It's easy.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.140]   We're--
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.460]   I think-- did you know, Chad, if we bought what we do here?
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:43.940]   We bought a subscription, right?
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:43.940]   No.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.060]   It's a creative cloud.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:45.740]   No.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.540]   We still use--
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.540]   We still use--
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:48.580]   No, no, no.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.940]   We have software that's installed.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.860]   We don't need to--
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:53.700]   Right.
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.260]   So we don't have--
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:54.780]   We have--
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:55.980]   But we have an upgrade.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:56.260]   No.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:56.780]   Yet.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:57.540]   No, we have an upgrade.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.220]   So we're using--
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.340]   I mean, truly, we only have three computers that
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:02.500]   have licenses anyway.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.700]   So when I want to make--
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.700]   You have to go over to that.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.060]   You have to go over to that computer
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.140]   and make sure it's free.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.740]   Because we have-- we fire people
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.300]   and we have a lot of disgruntled employees.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.780]   So we have to be very careful not to have
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.820]   pirated software anywhere.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.860]   Well, I mean, we just don't have any pirated stuff.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.260]   He says with a smile.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.820]   Just a joke.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:24.380]   $400 upgrade every year or every two years versus $600
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.220]   subscription.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.060]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.740]   I guess it's cheaper to buy.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.340]   $2,500 for the full master collection, which
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:37.620]   would be a $50 a month subscription.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.860]   And I think we're still on CS 5.5.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:40.780]   That's why.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.220]   Right.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:44.500]   Because the boss is far too cheap to buy you a new version.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.580]   There's no reason to upgrade.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.780]   What do you need to upgrade?
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.780]   What do you want it for?
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.420]   I thought we actually-- in fact, I would like to do that.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.620]   I thought we actually had a subscription to the creative cloud.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.380]   So I mean, the question is, do we need to put all seven
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.500]   computers on the set?
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.940]   No.
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:01.420]   Right.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.660]   So--
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.860]   I mean, we're still editing on--
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.820]   We don't use Premiere.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.740]   We use Final Cut Pro 7.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.980]   Well, there's a good reason for that.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:08.980]   Right.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.980]   Technically, right.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.460]   Not a financial reason.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:11.940]   Exactly.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.860]   It's more expensive than Apple's Final Cut Pro.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.260]   Right.
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.900]   But we used to have a community edit bay.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.420]   And now we don't, because we can't
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.900]   buy a new version of any editor.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:21.620]   We can't.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.300]   So sorry.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:25.700]   But that's technical, right?
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.660]   We're not being cheap.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.980]   We don't know if we're going to switch to Adobe or stick
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.180]   with an old version of Final Cut or what.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.020]   We don't know.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.100]   I think this is not unusual.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.340]   I think a lot of people who edit are saying, hmm, let's watch.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:41.700]   We've got to watch with interest to see what Apple does.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:45.940]   YouTube is offering a subscription service.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.620]   Man, I'll tell you.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.940]   I look at these channels, $1.99 a month.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.380]   I can't wait to subscribe.
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:56.380]   Um, not.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:57.380]   Where's the list of channels?
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.940]   YouTube.com/channel/paid.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.780]   Is that it?
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.780]   I'll just try that.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:04.780]   Let me pull it back.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.780]   That's logical.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.380]   Uh, so it's mostly archives, right?
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   No.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.380]   It gives you access to archives.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:11.980]   Oh, I thought I was going to do that.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:13.980]   What channels?
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.980]   Paid underscore channels.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:15.980]   Paid underscore channels.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   There it is.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:19.980]   Um, so you pay a fee.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.740]   It could range from a buck 99 a month to, I don't know what the top is, but it can be
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:32.740]   more for things like Justice Central TV, Laugh Factory VIP.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:33.740]   What is, yeah.
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:34.740]   Okay.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.740]   So this is, what is this?
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:40.300]   It looks like it's just duty, but courtrooms on YouTube.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.340]   She's, she's a, what?
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:44.340]   That's not judge duty.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:45.340]   That's judge Morgan Fidgier.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.140]   First ever 20 hell hour all court channel nonstop drama.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.780]   You need some time to think?
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.780]   Okay.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.780]   Fine.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.780]   Your time's up.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:55.780]   Nonstop.
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.780]   Oh, burn.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.780]   This is a touchdown request.
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:03.340]   This is a serious, a central blonde woman does not look like a judge.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.540]   Uh, America's court and justice for all.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.940]   Judge Morgan Fidgier.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.940]   And I'm here.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.900]   So what is that cost?
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.020]   So if we click a video and by the way, you get, you get much.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.500]   You get two weeks free, two dollars a month.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.980]   And it's two dollars a month if you, two weeks free.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   But you know what?
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:26.140]   If you love court TV, the idea of hot and cold running court TV all the time for a buck
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.900]   not in mind in a month, that's pretty appealing.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.540]   And that's the only subscription you have to buy.
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.540]   So it's, it's like Netflix, but only that.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:33.780]   Here's my question.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.220]   Where the hell is this video coming from?
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:39.100]   It's coming from, from content creators that made it themselves.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.100]   I assume.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.100]   It's got 25 views.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.660]   Well, it just rolled out.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.420]   It's 25 views.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:48.260]   It's strange daddy.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.260]   What?
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.700]   Bales again.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:51.700]   So 20.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.580]   So, but there, this is a lot of money.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.060]   The production, this is a lot of money.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.820]   They got to get courts.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.300]   I mean, this is a real court.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.580]   This is a TV court, right?
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.660]   It's like Judge Judy, right?
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:04.660]   That's expensive.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:08.300]   And they're producing this based on the fact that they think, what do you think?
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.420]   Uh, a hundred thousand people have to subscribe to make this worthwhile.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:17.140]   This, this is actually the one that seems to have the most content out of all of them.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.140]   I know.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.140]   Look at that.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.140]   They've been cracking these things out.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.300]   I'm unfamiliar with the history.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.860]   I mean, this may have been made for, for, oh, maybe it's old.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.060]   Yes, yes.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.700]   Maybe these are, these are old.
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:33.340]   And if you go back and look at, whoops, if you look at, and some of these kids stuff,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.340]   it's obvious.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.340]   Like Franklin, I have seen.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.340]   Yeah, Franklin, the turtle.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.340]   On television.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.340]   Sure.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.340]   I know.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:40.340]   I love that show.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.340]   What about all the time?
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.340]   I watch it.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.180]   Real wisdom TV.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.180]   Real wisdom TV.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.980]   I mean, and UFC select.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.980]   I mean, that's definitely-
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:48.980]   Well, UFC, I understand.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:50.460]   There's UFC National Geographic.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:53.100]   There's three kind of established products.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:58.460]   UFC National Geographic and the Oprah- No, what is the third one I can do?
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.460]   There's sesame Street.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.460]   Sesame Street.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.460]   That's right.
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:03.460]   See, I can see that.
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.560]   Now, this is real wisdom.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.740]   This is for $4.99 a month.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.060]   Gary, scroll over to the right.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.140]   I want to see what it says there.
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:10.740]   Well, I'm great at personal power.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:11.740]   Part of the response-
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:14.700]   I don't want to hear any more of that.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.340]   But what does a text say over there?
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:17.580]   It's real wisdom TV.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:22.140]   I want to learn to read faster, generate greater wealth or fine happiness.
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.980]   50 hours of content a month for $5.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.140]   It will add at least 10 new hours.
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.860]   Oh, so they're only committing to 10 new hours a month.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:37.420]   So this is definitely not what I was expecting when YouTube said they were going to roll
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.420]   out subscriptions.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.020]   Yeah, what did you expect?
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.660]   Well, for people to have the possibility of paying for channels they already like.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:50.940]   I was expecting for sure Gik and Sandri and a bunch of established YouTube channels.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:54.780]   It's very hard to have people pay for what used to be free.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:59.020]   I don't think Gik and Sandri has so many views that it would-
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:02.340]   Additional content or you have to do more.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:03.340]   It makes sense.
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.340]   What you're saying makes sense.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.340]   But this?
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.740]   Well, this is junk TV is what it is.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.220]   No, it's catalog.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:15.380]   The question now is who's going to develop what kind of fresh content based on this model?
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.820]   And without a guarantee, you're taking a chance.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.540]   I'm sure you have to sign a deal saying I'm going to produce a certain number of hours
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.540]   of television.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.780]   For X-month or a year.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:32.820]   The old Google channel thing deal was I think 50 hours of fresh content in one year.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.140]   That was the total you had to do.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:35.620]   One hour a week, something like that.
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:40.140]   Actually, it makes sense that it's only catalog because that's not a bunch of content.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:41.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.140]   There must be that core TV that is no way they had that all pretty much.
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.740]   This smart TV channel, it looks like they're the creators of Justice and-
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.740]   Well, they go a bunch of them.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.740]   The recipe, comedy.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:51.740]   We can.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.740]   And so this looks like some sort of production house.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.020]   They bought a bunch of old stuff.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.020]   Maybe they owned it.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.220]   Maybe they created themselves and they've been trying to sell it to-
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.820]   What would you do if you were YouTube?
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:04.820]   What would you do?
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:05.820]   It's a little bit of a challenge.
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:10.580]   YouTube right now has the reputation of getting lots of views but not making their
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.860]   creators much money in general.
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.700]   And unfortunately, the reason, part of the reason is advertisers are a little nervous
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:18.700]   about the platform.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:21.980]   They don't want to be in a "Growing Kick" video.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:24.580]   And so they don't know exactly what they're getting.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:25.580]   How do you make YouTube-
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:26.580]   You don't call it.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:31.620]   And clearly, YouTube has ambitions to become a premium content creator.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.940]   Yeah, Eric Schmidt says, "We've already won.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.420]   He's dead."
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:39.100]   And that's a bit of a reaching.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:43.020]   I mean, when's the last time you just sat in front of the TV or your PC saying, "Oh,
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.180]   I have an hour to kill.
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:45.180]   What's YouTube?"
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.700]   Yeah, that works if you're 12.
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.180]   But that's it.
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:55.300]   Well, I think what he meant by that is it's dead but the body hasn't hit the floor yet.
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:56.700]   Kind of feel like that.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.860]   Well, no, anyway, their ambitions are dead.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.860]   YouTube's clearly not dead.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.860]   Oh, no.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:03.780]   I mean, it's amazing.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.780]   It's wonderful.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.300]   I want it to survive.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.380]   But I don't think that Google's ambitions for it are viable.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:15.220]   Well, they got to start small and iterate and it's going to take them time.
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:16.220]   They're going to try stuff.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.220]   They're just trying.
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.220]   This is throwing stuff up against the wall.
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:24.660]   It's hard to imagine a scenario where in 10 years say we haven't made a huge shift over
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:31.620]   to watching the majority of our content on Netflix or maybe HBO Go and services like HBO
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.620]   Go or channels as apps and YouTube.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:43.500]   In that sense, TV is definitely on its last legs as we know it today.
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:49.860]   Leo, would you consider putting your back catalog, the archives on a channel like this
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.060]   with a subscription or--
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.060]   You're making this all--
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:54.060]   You're making this all.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.060]   It's all available for free now.
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.060]   I mean, I know.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.060]   I know.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:00.580]   If I had been smart, I would not have put my back catalog online and then I could have
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:03.620]   had some, but I've been giving it away for so long.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.660]   I don't think anybody would pay for it at this point.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.820]   I did think a little bit about this.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:12.620]   We'd have to make some new content that, in my opinion, you only pay for content if
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:22.100]   either it makes you money like Wall Street Journal, if it's somehow really compelling
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:26.820]   like House of Cards, where everybody's talking about it and you got to watch that, or there's
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:27.820]   enough for right.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.660]   House of Cards, you wouldn't pay $7.90 in a month just to watch House of Cards, but House
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:38.620]   of Cards and Arrested Development and a whole back catalog of old movies maybe.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:42.100]   It's hard to think of what people are willing to pay for.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:47.580]   Have you, Ryan, tried any experiments with paid content?
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.140]   You mean professionally as in--
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.860]   Yeah, I'll gadget or end gadget or--
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:57.980]   Now, mostly for the same reasons that you just mentioned, it's effectively impossible
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:02.700]   to monetize web content when all of your competition is free.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.700]   And that's OK.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:09.540]   There are adjacent ways of making money in most cases if you're creative, but in a kind
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:17.420]   of straight, newsy world like an end gadget or something, you have to really kind of embrace
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:24.580]   the fact that you're going to be web-ad based in terms of your revenue model for quite a
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:26.580]   while to come.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:32.620]   I mean, I'm a big believer in ad-supported free media, but that's what I grew up in.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.500]   That's what I know, I radio and television.
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.660]   So I don't know paid content.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:40.940]   Well, you know, I mean, somebody who's doing it right I think is GigaOM, he has GigaOM
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:47.660]   Pro where that's kind of OAM's professional market research and intelligence group.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:50.860]   Yeah, you're making money if you subscribe to that and make some money.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.860]   There you go.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:56.020]   So it's not something for your average audience member.
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.580]   And they know it and they charge for it.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.860]   And it seems to be working very well for them.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:02.580]   So they've got that figured out.
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:05.140]   But that's kind of a niche within content.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.940]   That's not what we think of as being content with a capital C.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.940]   Right.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.940]   And somebody in the chatroom said training and that's true.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:13.260]   You know, lynda.com.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:17.900]   People pay if it helps you get better at your job or teaches you to do something you need
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:18.900]   to know.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.420]   I mean, I guess we could do that, something like that.
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:24.460]   Yeah, but then you look at like Khan Academy and iTunes U.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.860]   There's just so much of that stuff that's free and you know, it's not even crappy.
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:35.820]   I mean, you know, world-class universities are publishing their entire catalogs through
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:36.820]   those venues.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.820]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.540]   Yeah, it's wonderful.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.540]   I like free.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.860]   Free is a good price.
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:48.300]   And to be fair, even YouTube is it seems actually, you know, more interested in getting
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:50.740]   ad revenue than subscription.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.740]   Right.
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:57.060]   That it just it's just more, you know, with the volume, you just can't replicate with
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.060]   the subscription.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.340]   I just think they're puzzled.
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:00.340]   I just think they're puzzled.
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:03.260]   I think they're trying to figure it out and they're trying different stuff.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:11.940]   A big story at ABC announced it's going to offer live ABC programming from their local
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:17.140]   stations on the folks who use the ABC app in New York and Philadelphia.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.340]   They announced this at their upfront this week.
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:26.820]   That is quite a shock, especially since Ariel so pissed off Fox and CBS that they said they
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:31.860]   were going to pull their free cable, free broadcast stuff.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:40.580]   ABC is going to stream their live function live broadcasting from their local channels.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.900]   That's kind of saying, well, I know we think it's a good idea.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.220]   Very interesting.
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:50.460]   The mobile live stream will not carry the same ads as a television broadcast, but we'll
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:54.860]   have the digital to ads that you see on site like ABC.com.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:58.500]   This is according to the New York Times because the Nielsen company cannot measure mobile
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.060]   viewing of live TV.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.340]   I've got it.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:09.220]   That's got to be just an acknowledgement that this is what consumers want and we're going
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.220]   to figure out a way.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:15.540]   Again, we've got to figure out a way to make this work, but this is what people are demanding.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:16.820]   Very interesting.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:24.940]   The technology is from a company called Syncback, SYNC, B-A-K.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.500]   And CBS has a minority stake in Syncback.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.780]   Fox is also working on live streaming functionality.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:35.020]   So maybe that's why they didn't like Ariel because they want to do it themselves through
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.020]   their own app.
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.620]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.420]   We're going to wrap this up pretty soon.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:41.060]   We got Ryan Block here from GDGT.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:41.900]   I'm sure you want to.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:43.540]   I'm sure Veronica's just going, come on.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:44.540]   Let's get out of here.
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:45.740]   I want to go to dinner.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.260]   We've got Cedric Gingran.
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:51.180]   He's stuck here because he's French and Patrick Bejot.
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.460]   It's like three in the morning there.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   I don't know.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.460]   What is it?
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.460]   1 AM?
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.460]   Half past two.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:57.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.460]   Buncha.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460]   Gingga.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.460]   Dingo.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   We're all closing.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:05.060]   That's still going to get no chance for an absence.
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.740]   What is it you, Frenchy's drink?
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:07.740]   Lile?
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.740]   Oh, please.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:09.740]   Good wine.
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.740]   Dubonet.
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:11.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.740]   Bordeaux.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:13.740]   What else?
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.740]   We have some Bordeaux.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.900]   We should have opened some Bordeaux for Cedric.
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:21.300]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:27.260]   Everything you need to create an exceptional website, including beautiful, beautiful templates
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.180]   since its platform upgrade to Squarespace 6 last fall.
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:33.420]   They just keep putting out new stuff.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.020]   They have a 24/7 support team.
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020]   I did not know this.
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.580]   They're around the clock support team.
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:41.620]   Live chat during the week, extremely fast email support day and night.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:44.100]   They have plans starting as low as $8 a month.
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.660]   That includes hosting plus software.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.140]   Don't go to those other guys.
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:51.620]   This is, I mean, this is the way to go.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.340]   It's an amazing value.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.620]   They have a full-time design team.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:58.140]   They regularly add new features and design templates.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:01.660]   They just added a new calendar feature, the events collection that allows you to share
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:06.220]   schedules, store sale events, band tour dates, that kind of thing.
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:11.700]   With your readers, they also released a lovely full-bleed template, which photographers are
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.700]   going to love.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:13.700]   There it is.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:14.700]   Momentum.
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   You found it.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   It's beautiful.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.740]   And all of their templates are mobile responsive.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:25.020]   That means they work great no matter what size is screened from iPhone to 27-inch display.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.020]   Everything is drag and drop.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.020]   You don't have to be a designer.
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:30.940]   Of course, if you are a designer, they have a great developer platform as well.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:35.420]   Their page builder tool, the layout engine, enables you to customize pages just by adding
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:39.580]   blocks of content, photos, videos, social media text.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:43.660]   You can preview as you go so you always know exactly what it's going to look like.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.820]   Their style editor allows you a selection of fonts.
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:49.620]   By the way, they support all the hundreds of Google fonts automatically.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:50.920]   Great fonts.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.180]   Best of all, they've just added e-commerce.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:57.060]   So if you're selling stuff, you don't need to add a separate plugin to do this.
[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.860]   It's all built in.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:47:59.860]   And boy, is the price read.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.780]   As I mentioned, it starts at $8 as low as $8 a month.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:05.980]   The unlimited plan, which a lot of people are going to want, $16 a month with an annual
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:11.420]   purchase, $20 a month to month, gives you unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, bandwidth.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:12.660]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.860]   No matter how popular you get, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:21.300]   And then if you want to add e-commerce, $24 a month for everything.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:25.660]   The integrated unlimited physical products, unlimited digital products, mp3s and CDs,
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:27.100]   books and e-books.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.100]   There's a mobile store.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:29.300]   You get inventory tracking.
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:33.180]   You get taxes automatically calculated in every venue.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.820]   You got shipping, coupon control.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.860]   So you can add a coupon and all the unlimited stuff.
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:42.260]   And when you buy an annual plan, a custom domain name free, they'll hook it all up for
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.260]   you.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:44.260]   You got it.
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.260]   I love this.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.260]   These guys really know what they're doing.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.740]   If you're looking to build a website, especially if you're thinking about e-commerce, you got
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.820]   to go to squarespace.com.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:53.140]   Once started free 14-day trial, you don't need a credit card.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:57.980]   If you decide to buy and only then you can use our offer code TWIT5, because we're in
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:02.100]   the fifth month May, and the number five to get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.100]   That's why.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:04.740]   Another reason the annual plans are good way to go.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:05.740]   Squarespace.com.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:09.180]   What a great place to make your next website.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:13.580]   I tell the story all the time, Ryan, about you in Veronica and the wedding site that
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.580]   you did.
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:15.580]   Yep.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.140]   I'm an expensive provider and it was funky and just squarespace.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:21.140]   Jump right in.
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:22.700]   Yeah, we couldn't get it to work.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:25.100]   We used squarespace and we knocked it out in an afternoon.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.100]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:27.620]   Is this site still alive?
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.380]   I think it is.
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:34.460]   Although I'm not going to assure the domain, but you can probably guess it.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.300]   I haven't had a chance to use it since, but if I need to do that kind of knock out of
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:42.140]   site real quick, I will probably be using it again in the future.
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:43.140]   Yeah, it's just fabulous.
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:45.660]   Hey, here's a heartwarming story.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:46.820]   I love this.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:49.180]   Her name is Jenny Lamir.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:54.700]   She was the only woman present at a Boston hackathon, high school student.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:59.060]   She's a senior from Nashua, New Hampshire, who likes building robots, hiking and entering
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.940]   hackathon competition.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:05.140]   She goes to the Academy of Notre Dame in Massachusetts.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:09.700]   She was the only woman at the hackathon on April 27th.
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:14.900]   80 other competitors, all of them male.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:23.020]   She took her subcategory, Best Use of Sync to Broadcast, and overall Best in Show for her
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:29.620]   application, which blocks spoilers on Twitter.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.180]   Brilliant.
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.140]   Brilliant.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:36.380]   You can type in what you want to block Game of Thrones.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.300]   I don't want to know.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.540]   I haven't watched it yet.
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:39.660]   You need this.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.820]   You cannot watch a show anymore.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.540]   Game of Thrones, you can't watch after Sunday because you just can't go to Twitter because
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.540]   it's going to be all over Twitter.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:49.540]   Oh my God, did you see what happened?
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:54.540]   Well, I don't know if you followed jerks who actually was spoiler alert.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.860]   Well people forget, you know, they forget that not everybody watches at the same time.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:06.180]   But this is a great story from Mother Jones about a young woman, 17-year-old who is a
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:07.180]   great hacker.
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:08.300]   And there you go.
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.780]   That's an inspiration for all of us.
[01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:12.900]   I don't know if she's going to release this as an app.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:13.900]   I hope she does.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.900]   That would be cool.
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:16.420]   That's a great idea.
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.580]   There's actually a French side that does the exact opposite.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.100]   You just click on a button and it spoils every movie you think of one other time.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:26.940]   I put the link down there next to the story.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:32.060]   It's called "Eon Fett Erefsehen" and like, what's that?
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.420]   A very bad trip.
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.140]   And it says, "Oh" and then Dien, he sleeps on the roof.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:38.540]   Oh my God, that's terrible.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.380]   It's like all spoilers all the time.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.380]   Yep.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:42.380]   Did you have a name?
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.380]   Wow.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:44.380]   There you go.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.020]   So silent, green as people.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.020]   Oh!
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:48.780]   I haven't seen that yet.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:51.940]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:52.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:53.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:52:00.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:07.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:14.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:52:49.940 --> 01:53:19.940]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
