[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.140]   I thought sure seems like it was the time take advantage of the renaissance. Anyway, we're I think we're not done
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.340]   I think we were hoping to get one more host one more host in mind and when we get her I mean him
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.340]   I mean her
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.700]   They get them. I don't know what pronoun they use
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.420]   We'll let you know about that, but we're really excited. So thank you everybody for putting up with a little bit of inside
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   Twit as we get under
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.780]   Way, I don't know what to talk about today
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.460]   Apple's third quarter results. They made some money shocking big surprise
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.740]   I love what Jason Snell does and he always does these color graphs
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:43.820]   Total app and revenue now you see that drop, but you can also see it's a spiky thing and in fact the revenue isn't bad considering
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.860]   It's a what Apple calls QQ3. I think
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.180]   Their big quarter is of course in September. It'll be next quarter when the iPhone comes out
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.900]   So this is this is the quarter before the iPhone
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.500]   I think the big story is service revenue which we knew was going up went up a lot
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   It's now 21% in fact if you look at this pie chart
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.140]   What's really interesting is the iPhone for the first time in a long time is less than half of Apple's total revenue
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.900]   Yeah, that's a that's a pretty big deal
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.180]   We haven't seen that in so long and that is of course what folks who are looking for a story kind of latched on to here
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.540]   I mean that is a big deal and it kind of speaks to
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.700]   What we've seen is the narrative of Apple going forward where we're not seeing as much money from the iPhone where we're having to look in
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.500]   Other places Apple has been saying services services services non-stop in their earnings reports for quite some time now
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.780]   And so it's no surprise to me that we're seeing 21% of the revenue coming from that
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:53.140]   But I think that the bigger story here and the thing that other people were kind of paying attention to is wearables accounts for quite a bit
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:59.340]   It's now wearables for Apple is not just wearables. It's the home pub home pod. It's the airpah
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.420]   It's a punch it's kind of a catch-all for it. It's almost should be called other rather. I yeah, I think so
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.260]   Yeah, what's interesting? Yeah, what's interesting about wearables is these are accessories to iPhone
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.020]   So they they've monetized the heck out of iPhones they made you know
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.660]   they Apple is what it is today because of iPhones and now as iPhones kind of plateau and even decline a little bit the
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.180]   accessories to iPhones are
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.260]   Doing great stuff for them and then the next big thing I think which is gonna be way huger than people think is the Apple credit card
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:36.260]   Which it's not going to service as those services, but I think the potential there is gigantic. Yeah, I don't think it's next month
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.980]   I think it's soon. I think it's any minute now. Yeah, maybe even as the show
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.340]   And it will have an announcement, but I think probably next week. They're gonna announce the titanium Apple credit card
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   You could really safely say services is an accessory for the iPhone. You could yeah, absolutely
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:57.460]   But it's not just for the iPhone. I think that's Mac - well, no, no, I don't even mean it's not just Apple stuff
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:05.780]   That's the one thing is that we see we see Siri we see Apple kind of diversifying here where they are reaching out to sort of offer their
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.260]   services on third parties, so we've got these smart TVs now that work with with
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.380]   Home kit that work with AirPlay 2 and have Apple TV
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.140]   They have Apple TV at built-in Apple is no longer well in in some cases
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.980]   It's no longer especially with its services trying to play in this walled garden
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.100]   And I think that's because the company kind of knows hey, we've got to look at other ways to make money so I think this
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:35.580]   cyclical effect with the hardware because I want to say about three years ago. We were saying that about the iPad
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.540]   And we were it was dying right, you know, but now
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.620]   phones are a little more more robust now and you have a lot more longevity
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.340]   So why do you have to spend a thousand dollars every two years four years, and that's what that's what they're saying that
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.380]   It is the average for people now to hang their phone for four years
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.900]   And this is just like the iPad like the problem with the iPad it was this too good. Yeah, you get one and I keep mine for about four months
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.300]   Well, that's you though
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.780]   You got a problem, you know with this in fact this is an intervention
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:13.620]   I'm actually nervous because next month is phone month right where this week we're gonna get the note 10 announced
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.380]   Next probably said I'm gonna get September 10th Apple have an event announced three new iPhones
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.420]   Yeah, they'll be a Google Pixel 4 probably shortly after that and then ifa's coming in September
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.780]   There'll probably be a bunch of phones there. I'm gonna be spending
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.300]   I got a problem this time of the year
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.940]   I
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.500]   Don't think you hate me. Yeah, you sound no in fact Lisa will back me up on this I said last year
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.940]   I don't want to buy a new phone. She said you know you're going to you have to have to talk about it
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.940]   I don't like that idea of spending a thousand dollars on the right
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:54.180]   And you know what I wouldn't mind this thousand dollars if it were like oh light use better. I'm getting the new thing
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   Right, it's the same freakin phone. Yeah, I can't run premier on this. I can't run after effects on this is not
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.460]   Were you a different needs than a normal human? Yes, I am but I'm not your average human
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.980]   Yeah, but but I have I have to say in some ways the note 10 is gonna be a lesser phone
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:18.660]   It's not gonna have a headphone jack according to the renders which really pisses me off the pixel 4 isn't gonna have the dedicated wide-angle lens either
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.460]   But it'll have solely which is kind of cool
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:30.100]   So the is radar that that shoots out from the top of the phone that enables in the air gestures and also face recognition
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:36.020]   So unlike the iPhone which when you swipe it it recognize your face and turns on the pixel 4
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.380]   You just pick it up and it turns on you don't have to swipe anything. So it's way easier
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.700]   No more swiping allegedly, but but it also this is the one where we're gonna look like idiots going like this
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.620]   We are we are leo to our phones. We are waving and we're dancing semaphores to the macarena
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.420]   Yeah, why am I wish it did that?
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.980]   Unfortunately, it's gonna be right above the phone you'll be able to pause and and and go to the next song and and silence the phone
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.460]   So you wait to go to the next I
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.880]   Know what's the difference between that and going like this to the next song or well this actually involves contact?
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.080]   Where's this you're right? It hurts my finger to touch the screen. I will work
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.340]   So much work. I hate it. I'm sure there's a reason
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:24.580]   But what's cool about solely is we've seen a lot of technologies that come out for in the air gestures. They haven't really taken off
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:31.100]   Some have been sort of built into laptops. Some have been you know standalone devices magic leap one of those companies
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.940]   Not magically, but there's another one. I forgot what it's called leap motion or something
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.660]   Oh, she is the one Apple bought that does hand gestures didn't really come take off because it didn't come from Apple or Google
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.100]   I have one in my closet. It's like I never used it was dopey. Yeah, I don't really need it. Yeah. No the
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.900]   This is the confusing. There's the leap
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.820]   Magic leap is the one you wear on your eyes. The leap motion is that little laws in you put between your kids
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.660]   Right in the screen. Yeah, that's what I'm with it
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.020]   And just restore kickstart a whole world of gestures and habits and things like that
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.660]   It makes more sense if it's built in the phone
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:09.060]   I have to say one thing that's interesting is as Google apparently and they've been pretty open about the pixel 4 this time around
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:14.700]   Isn't gonna use a notch you're just gonna have a fairly big bezel up at the top of your life all these cameras
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.100]   There's solely there's the projector for the face recognition
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.940]   They're gonna put a lot of still out there, but not a wide angle lens
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.740]   So they're gonna do the wide ankle sort of in software. It's gonna be slightly wider
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.100]   The selfie cameras can be slightly wider than the one in the front, but well
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.860]   Google is proven proven it's pretty strong when it comes to computational photography
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.940]   So I don't mind that they're not putting that extra lens in there if they can figure out from an AI state
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.620]   A lot with a single lens in the pixel 3. That's what you use right? Yeah, that's a great camera
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.840]   I was pleasantly surprised. I was visiting the Google campus in San Francisco
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:56.180]   One of my friends works there and she took some photos of us, you know, just what their phone
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:02.620]   Yeah, I didn't say the name. Yeah, you know why
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:09.860]   And I she sent me the Google photos library link or whatever and those photos looked incredible and I
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.200]   Don't know. There's just something about being able to snap and boop and be done with it versus with my iPhone
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.820]   Yes, it might make the more accurate photo
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:24.180]   But I'm not necessarily after the accurate photo because I'm gonna end up hitting that edit do this this this and this right into it
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.060]   I kind of like the computational if it's gonna give me a photo that I'd like to share immediately
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.400]   My wife has an iPhone 10 and she's always borrowing my camera my phone to take pictures
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.380]   She knows it's gonna be a much better picture and you're a pro photographer
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.360]   There's no I mean gee are you at the point now where you think a camera phone is as good as you need it to be?
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.740]   Well my photo of the week this previous week was taken with my phone no kidding
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.520]   Where's that where people definitely seem to like it so on Instagram comm slash and to prove it
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.140]   He took a picture of his camera. Yes, I did
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:02.780]   Now that we were on our family vacation this flower one well yeah that one too
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.800]   But that's with the phone that's beautiful look at the color and the detail and it's almost a macro shot
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.380]   Right look at the background is the softness of the background the one before that and this one is I did more
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.580]   Processing on it, but that's with the
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.500]   That's what the pixel yeah, I have to say we we went to the
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   Peruvian the Inca ruins Machu Picchu a couple of years ago, and I brought a 360 degree camera
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.280]   I brought my Canon with mark four
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.740]   With all the lenses I brought all this stuff we got up at sunrise you carried all that heavy
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.000]   One best picture I got was a pixel - yeah, it was
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.980]   Far and away the best picture of my future well
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.100]   Here's the other thing I think the killer feature of the pixel 3 is the
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.660]   The ability to take pictures when people smile or do things like that
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.100]   So one of the things I do is we do as we're traveling around we do a lot of things with various people
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.660]   We're cooking and make stuff like that. I just set it up
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.900]   Get it going and forget about it right and after we're done. I have like 30 pictures
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.220]   Oh, yeah, you did that the last time you were here that was
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:10.860]   Smiling and laughing so you put it on a tripod you put it there and you said everyone's won't look at it and smile
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.700]   Even if I don't say that people
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.220]   They're gonna do that exactly and and you those are better pictures when you're taking people shots
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:24.460]   So you so I never did see the pictures you got when you were here at last so that what's nice is those are more like action shots
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.460]   those are like
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.940]   Those are like there's the kind of pictures you want for personal stuff not for professional shots
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.260]   All right, well, that's candidates
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.660]   I don't actually want people to smile in my serious photos. I want them to frown. Well, here's the thing
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.220]   I mean, I think the point is because I carry a Sony a7 III as well
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:49.180]   Sometimes a high-end cameras takes a better shot and sometimes the phone takes a better shot depends on the light the context
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:54.860]   The situation you can whip a phone out and take a picture just like that whereas you can't get your regular camera out fast enough
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.820]   Right, so I use both all the time and sometimes the better shot is one and sometimes it's the other yeah
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.020]   Yeah, gotta have both
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:07.220]   Wow, look at that. This is so I'm not kidding. I brought a ton of gear up
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:13.060]   This is a pixel to pixel - that's beautiful goodness the detail the clarity the Christmas
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.060]   I
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.460]   The point really though is it's the camera you have and
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.340]   It's there at the right moment
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.180]   The perfect moment with the Sun and just come up and blah blah blah
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.060]   Yeah, I think it's great that with these cameras are so good in the phone
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.660]   I burn a lot of calories carrying around I know you have your 60 though. You get pounds of yeah
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.780]   You didn't leave your 60 at home even though you have the pixel through no I bring you everything
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:43.820]   But but I still get it you if the phone is in your pocket just whip it out and shoot
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.340]   By the way another thing I noticed there's a little bit of orange on the set today. Oh, yeah
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:55.540]   All this such a beautiful color. It's Clemson orange today. I don't know where all that came from. I didn't
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.740]   Talk about hiring you
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.540]   Lisa said what about it? I said I love it and I would love to hire him
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.540]   But he's never leaving Clemson. He's never leaving North Carolina at one point you were right about that
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:15.460]   All right, he his kids asked me how which college football team do you favor?
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.460]   What what are you talking about college football? What are you talking about? Is that what's that?
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.540]   I'm a Clemson fan. I say I'm a Clemson fan
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.020]   What am I drinking coffee for?
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:35.180]   Let's go back and look at iPad revenue you mentioned iPad and there were there was a really kind of
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:42.220]   Drop in the iPad revenue from the fourth quarter 2017 through the fourth quarter 2018 down to you know
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:47.860]   It just dropped dropped drop and then it's suddenly turned around still cyclical and it's going it's cyclical
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.060]   But it's but it's an 8% growth year over year this quarter
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:58.860]   22% the so I pack I think this is the iPad pro clearly the iPad Pro Mac sales revenue up 11%
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.940]   year over year so there's some strength in Apple's hardware business
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:10.300]   But yeah, obviously iPhone is the problem iPhones driven Apple for some I hear so many people talking about using the iPad as a
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.020]   100% work device
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:19.540]   And I don't think I could ever do it it always feels to me and we often have people on set using
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.500]   Jason snell's a good example using their iPad pro and I just feel we talked about this on iOS today
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.860]   I was feel like they're sacrificing. They're like mmm. No, I can do it. Honestly. Yeah
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.420]   You say it's one of those things where you awkwardly wait. They're like no, no, I got
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:40.500]   And then and now they're all excited because iOS 13 you have a mouse. Yeah, and it's this big round dot on the screen
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:46.940]   It's like come on guys. There's a mouse in your laptop. It doesn't do a I just I don't understand why people
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.700]   I maybe they just is it's not lighter once in fact you and I both bought the bridge keyboard
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.740]   Like yeah, it's heavy. It's like why not just use a laptop
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.380]   Topweight yeah, I didn't necessarily like the
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:05.460]   File system quote unquote that is there the hidden file system
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.180]   I couldn't figure out if I want to work on a raw file where it was right wait a minute
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.380]   You don't know that the biggest problem is the raw workflow
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:19.560]   Mm-hmm because I actually have to say a 12.9 h iPad is a good for a photographer that the screen's great
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.660]   And being able to manipulate with your fingers or the pencil
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.300]   You can reject if you're using lightroom reject room, you know go
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.100]   Pencil and lightroom touch sensitivity is a beautiful but a bunch of times I've been finding your files
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.780]   I've been working on the Ron. It's the J-P. It's just like it's a little yeah, I think that can be solved one day
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.900]   I think one day well Apple hopes it'll be in the I mean we've we've seen some improvements made with the
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.300]   Finally that's coming finally and iOS 13 is coming the support to
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.540]   You can plug in a USB C flash drive or you can plug in a
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:03.260]   Dock and then plug in your USB drive or whatever you want there and there's some direct import into different apps
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.260]   Features available now that maybe we're not available in the past and some new shortcuts and things like that
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:15.100]   So there are improvements that are being made in that area because I too whenever I'm doing photo editing
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.100]   I like to use pixel-made or photo
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.580]   And Leo we talked about how you someone had asked us if there was gonna be Photoshop on the iPad and or an
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.600]   I on iPad yeah, and we'd kind of talked about how you don't really need it because there's so many great apps and
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.940]   Affinity pixel-made or photo is excellent on there. Have you used pixel-made or photo?
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:37.180]   I've played around with it. It's incredible. I've used affinity more thing. It's really really powerful also hard to use
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.660]   It's kind of a lot of menus and it's it's getting there once you know it
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:47.420]   They've put a lot into it and it's just a viable competitor to people that don't want to start the monthly
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:53.740]   Adobe subscription fee. Yeah, I think I think everybody I'm sure you are looking for a way out from the creative cloud
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.900]   I can't I can't I love the dynamic link especially when I'm using Premiere Pro
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.700]   Yeah, excuse me. I want to work on a motion graphic or something
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.540]   I literally just right click and jump in there. They have this sweet
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.740]   It's a sweet and it all integrates nicely together. It's it's so good or fan a monthly audio
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740]   It just hops over to audition
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.420]   That's that's what keeps me in it's that link there was a rumor
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.860]   I don't know if I credit this that Apple might buy Adobe and that make it that make any sense
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.740]   No, it's not the kind of acquisition Apple makes
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.380]   They like a small company easily integrate hire the people. Yep forget the company
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.620]   Yep
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.260]   I give Adobe credit because I can remember I think it was 2016 or 2017
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   I was at Adobe max and
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:45.140]   In depress event or whatever people were just badgering them about the whole subscription process because you have capture one in affinity and
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.500]   Capture one you buy outright right and and the CEO just looked straight at and you said
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.180]   This is what's working you can take it right?
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.780]   He's like, yeah, we're gonna shut this down right now. This is the subscription plan people are still buying it
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:07.020]   Yeah, so and now Microsoft's moving that direction everybody's book in the subscription direction. Yeah, all my apps subscriptions
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:12.620]   Yeah, I don't think anybody likes it except the companies on the other hand
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:18.300]   It maybe it's a little more realistic because the companies it's crazy to sell a product for five dollars and supported for five years
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:24.180]   That just doesn't make any sense. I think it clarifies how much you like the app though some to there are some they're like
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.420]   Oh, this here's a happily pay it because I love it and then others like not worth it
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.060]   Yeah, so it's like you really have to think about whether it's bringing value to your life and if it isn't
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.220]   Yeah, I thought the most interesting number Tim Cook or Tim Apple is
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:45.300]   Tim Apple brought up at the quarterly event is the R&D spending
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.900]   Which is through the roof Apple's been criticized for years for not spending enough on R&D
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:57.220]   They are spending enough for R&D the largest proportion of revenue in R&D since 2003
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.020]   It's an all-time high they spent four point two billion dollars in the quarter
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.940]   7.9 percent of its total revenue and
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:12.180]   They're on pace to spend 16 billion dollars this year 16 billion. What are they spending it on?
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.860]   What is Apple working on clearly? They want a successor to the iPhone? Yeah, but what is that is that a?
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   That's why they're spending the money. They don't know
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:29.140]   You could fly around oh my god, I'm sold for sure by that. Yeah, you have to really hold on tight an apple branded espresso machine
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:36.260]   I'm on it part of it is the them bringing in house things that they would normally get as a component a billion dollars for Intel's
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.340]   Emodeers and IP exactly that sort of thing so that's very expensive
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.700]   One of the interesting you think a lot of this the bulk of this is Apple saying we're gonna make all our chips
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.340]   We're gonna do arm chips. We're gonna do 5g radios. We're gonna do it all that's gotta be expensive
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:56.500]   Is that what most of this money is I do and I think I think the larger theme is that they're trying to do things that other companies can't do because they've
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.940]   They've learned that you know they come out these laptops. They can't trust Intel and also until let them down
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.300]   It's so that's exactly true and and it's so difficult
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.980]   For them to differentiate in this market because the copycats
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.500]   Coming out of China and elsewhere are really just sort of muddy the waters in terms of you know
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:20.020]   And so they want to be able to do by the way not just for apple for every business. That's right in america
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.060]   That's true
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.660]   But they want to do they want to be able to differentiate in a way that's really clear
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.660]   And so the way to do that is through technology one one interesting thing about
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:34.260]   R&D spending that I I love mentioning because it's always a shocker to people but the number one spender on r&d
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:39.620]   Is amazon by far they spend far more than apple. Yeah, you think wow what's a bookstore?
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.260]   Obviously they don't like that
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.860]   People have to realize how intense the technology play at amazon is how they're trying to reinvent the future
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.580]   Look what they do with the amazon echo. They want to have a home robot
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:57.140]   Baze who's always willing to spend profits on the next thing. That's right. In fact, this was always the knock on amazon
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.700]   They never show a profit effect at one point the market said we're not putting more money into you
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.540]   They had to actually borrow
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.940]   But it was it turned out to be the right strategy. They built all those fulfillment centers now
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.020]   What do you think they're doing now? What is there?
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.460]   Well, they're working on that home robot, but they're they're trying to get Jesus, you know
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.100]   It's gonna be rosy the rosy the robot
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:23.860]   Nobody wants a home robot. That's oh, I do that's reading sci-fi and saying oh, this would be good if it's a
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.540]   Yes
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.300]   What is it gonna do
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.380]   For your scotch if it's like a room bar that can also I don't know feed my room bus don't be
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.580]   Well, yes, but it's so vacuum is dopey. It's so vacuums though, and I make me not have to do it
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   That's like the right youtube
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:46.020]   No, YouTube might say that. I don't know. I mean, I think I think they were strongly encouraged by what happened with the echo
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:51.700]   So what happened was they came out with this and they didn't expect we now know they came out with what we now call smart speaker used to be like
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.500]   An assistant appliance and they own the market for two years
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.460]   That that's something only apple used to do when apple came out with the ipad
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.860]   There was no tablet other than the ipad for two years and amazon did that with the ekron
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.140]   They're thinking okay, we can change consumer behavior
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.580]   We can change how people live if we have the right technology
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.820]   Everybody's looking for look what the iphone did in ten years. I mean unbelievable in 2007
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:23.380]   From now from then till now we see people walking around staring at their phone every family goes to dinner
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.860]   They're walking in traffic the white ear earbuds
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.620]   You're always connected all the time no matter where you are
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:35.220]   It's built a surveillance economy on second to nine. I mean they talk about this may be
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.780]   this
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:43.700]   Equal to the steam engine in terms of an invention that changes society, right and it's done in 12 years
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.420]   So everybody wants the next that's right
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.020]   iPhone
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.060]   But that's I don't know if you can I don't know if you can sit down at the drawing board and say let's make the next iphone
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:27:01.780]   Yeah, I don't think you can I wonder how much investment in rnd or research is amazon doing far so logistics just from looking at where they've come from in the last
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.820]   10 years that's where you'd put your money if they're gonna be a
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.220]   so
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.940]   I guess some of that comes down to well. What is bayzos is
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:17.700]   Real mission statement and I I read somebody I think it's probably been Thompson saying to own a fraction of every financial transaction
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.100]   America oh cute
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.380]   So anytime you buy something bayzos gets a parade that adds up just a little ambitious
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.700]   Yeah, I've heard rumors that they're they're looking at buying
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.260]   They already own whole foods. They're looking at buying
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.140]   Other chains or building other start through chains and they want all the food to come from oh there's a little
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.780]   Hitch in the get along there didn't I think San Francisco and some other cities are starting to ban cash
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.460]   No cash businesses. Hmm that you have it was San Francisco past that because
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.860]   It's not everybody has a card has a phone has a watch right
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:56.180]   You're you're disadvantaging a huge swath of the population wants to just come in with five bucks and buy a potato chip
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.020]   That's all right and purchase anonymously which cash right anonymous
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.500]   So and but that's gonna hurt those grab and go stores all the stuff that amazon's been
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:10.100]   Playing with but this isn't the first time amazon's been heard they they killed this week. They killed the dash button
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.140]   Yes, because germany said
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.700]   You can't
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   Thank you germany germany said
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.060]   Dash button doesn't give consumer enough warning that he just bought something and I know this because remember
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:29.620]   I like the button so we got a dash button for toilet paper because I thought you should put that next to the toilet
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.940]   Except it won't come between the seat and the bowl
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.060]   It won't come fast apparently they're making toilets that do it automatically
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:41.380]   Anyway, it won't come but anyway we got one and all of a sudden every couple of days we get a case of toilet paper
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.260]   I realized that Michael
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.300]   Our 16 year old he was probably 14 or 13 at the time
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   We just press it whenever he saw it
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.860]   It won't let you reorder until the first order comes so he was probably pressing it every day
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.700]   No, but every three days we get another oil did we put it under lock and key?
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.900]   But that but that's to germany's point. No, I think we I don't know I hit it. It's in a box
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.700]   I actually hit it that looks like it's a lock and key
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.540]   No, no, this one is cool. This is our but this isn't gonna work. You know john in a couple of days
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.340]   That's so sad. I like these this is a really good idea. So this is in our battery box
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.260]   So I don't know if you have an over the shoulder shot of that karsten
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.900]   So john are these new or old
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.980]   These are new but when this runs low you push the button the energizer bunny button
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.620]   And amazon will deliver day after tomorrow new batteries to put in this box
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.460]   That's a perfect idea right when I get down to one paper towel roll
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.740]   I push the button and then the whole new thing comes into stock gonna work anymore
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.300]   That's that's devastating you can live
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:46.740]   You can live it up batteries. Okay paper towels. Just don't use them ever in our competition for the number one first world problem
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.100]   That one wins. Thank you
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.100]   Devasti
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.660]   Devasti
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.060]   They will have the on screen dash buttons on the website. Those are no. That's not the same
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:02.180]   That's I would refuse to use those. I I've seen them Amazon says
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:07.220]   Yeah, no, I don't know if this is true now. They said they're stopping the dash button because nobody uses them
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.860]   Hello, call me up
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.780]   We use it. I think this is a perfect use is a little special box
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.060]   Yeah, it's got batteries in it when the batteries run low. We push the button
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:22.420]   I don't know what about those ones. So a box a box for the stuff that you get when you dash box
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:29.380]   Can you say for laundry detergent for dish detergent for toilet paper for paper towels for dog food
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:35.140]   But here's what I think people are doing now. They're saying echo order more batteries echo, right?
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.260]   That's just as easy. Well, but then there's a confirmation. It says okay. What's your code?
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:46.820]   Uh, it can interact with you. It could say well, you know in the past you've ordered these batteries what kind of seems a little more pragmatic
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:52.020]   I'm not really I'm not really a as much as I love these different assistants
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.460]   I'm not really a fan of talking to them. I gotta be honest with you. So yeah
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:01.540]   I've got a bunch of echoes, but I'm not really fond of saying blah blah blah blah. There is echo news
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:07.860]   Uh, there's more to talk about we got a ton more to talk about I almost don't want to stop but I have to take a little break

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.900]   Do you know what you're gonna be doing when you get here? Do you have any ideas? Um, I thought I was supposed to be you know
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   Rolling out the mats and making sure
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:37.140]   Do we have shows ants gonna develop some shows for us right
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.060]   There's lots to do we've already worked that out. They don't tell me
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.460]   They're gonna form a union demand
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:49.620]   Chihuahua diga. What's your chihuahua's name? Uh our chihuahua is named jacks jacks
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:56.020]   He's a beast j a x j a x and but you also have a large dog. We have a large dog named kylofen
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:03.140]   Mashed a man. I say a massive slash pit. That is a huge dog. That's very large
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:09.460]   It's you took the most dangerous scary dog in the world and bred it with the largest dog in the world
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.660]   Now you get kylofren. Yeah, to be fair pits aren't dangerous. No, I know
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:20.340]   That's it. That's a that's a that's a lie. It's calumne. It's libel. They can be dangerous
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.700]   Pits are great with gert with kids. They love it. They could be trained to be mean. Yes, but that's a shock
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.540]   Shains they can be trained to be calum. The difference is when a dachshund is mean
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.260]   You're like a hollary
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.580]   It's
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.460]   Okay
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:42.420]   Uh our show today brought to you by this little doohickey. I love this guy euro euro is the solution to your Wi-Fi
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.380]   Wows if you're thinking about Wi-Fi at all you're thinking too much
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.580]   Wi-Fi should just work you should just open up your breakfast computer and you're online
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.620]   Right you head to the john and you're using your bathroom computer. You're online
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:04.340]   The problem is we're we're asking so much more of Wi-Fi now because we have all these devices internet of things devices
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.820]   Uh, we've got neighbors with Wi-Fi cause an interference
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.860]   It used to be Wi-Fi would just work of late Wi-Fi has been a hassle
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.940]   That's when euro came along and I just love it. They created the whole concept of a mesh system for your home
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.900]   Fast reliable Wi-Fi eliminating port coverage eliminating dead spots
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.980]   Eliminating buffering you'll have a strong signal whenever you need it one of the things euro does that's so interesting
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.300]   It's is the bandwidth shaping so if it says oh you're watching Netflix in the bedroom
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   You're going to need those packets and sequence
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.700]   Uh, but the kid is only reading email or he's playing fortnight
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.940]   It actually shapes your bandwidth
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.660]   No more complaints of the xbox not getting a signal that your security camera is offline when you need it
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.820]   And it's so easy to set up now
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:57.460]   We've got we've had mesh systems in enterprise for a long time, but it took an it professional to set them up to configure my know and you've done that
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.540]   It's a real we're using
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.860]   Stuff here that you got I mean it's a requires Java to set up. It's crazy
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.540]   Eero you get a great Eero app you plug in the Eero base unit you put the beacons
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.220]   Where you think the app will say no no closer farther it'll help you set it up
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   And then the app is also great too because you can manage your Wi-Fi you can see what has happening you see how many devices are on
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:24.020]   Your network. I have an Eero set up that when a new device joins my network. I get a ping
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.060]   So I'll see a new apple device is just joined the network and I can see if that's what's supposed to be or not
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:36.900]   It's yeah, they're in the house. You could pause the Wi-Fi. We do this. I assign every unit that comes into our house
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.260]   to
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:44.020]   Either Lisa or me or our kid Michael and if I want I can even do this with amazon's echo
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.340]   I could say echo pause michaels Wi-Fi
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.300]   And then we wait and we hear
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:55.380]   What happened to the Wi-Fi? It's great. It's so satisfying. I love it
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.140]   When it's that's power, maybe that's power
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:04.500]   Uh, you can share your Wi-Fi very easily with a QR code. It has a guest network
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.540]   And the other thing I really like about the Eero is Eero plus when you buy the Eero you get a
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.020]   I think you get a year as part of your deal
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.900]   uh, but I pay for I just renewed it because
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.300]   Eero plus does so many things you can have a block ads block malware
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.420]   You know, this is really something every house should have email with attachments malware attachments
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:32.180]   They get blocked. We have family safe browsing. So I could say michaels devices. No adult sites. No violence sites. No gambling sites
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:37.460]   Uh, this is really high quality scanning. It does a great job
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.140]   It also secures the traffic with encryption
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.460]   When wpa3 comes out, Eero's already said we're going to support it
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.100]   You're never going to get complaints about the Wi-Fi again. You won't have to think about the Wi-Fi again
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.140]   That's why we use Eero. That's why I set my mom up with Eero
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.940]   I can even monitor her network from my phone here
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.220]   So if mom has problems, I can go see her Wi-Fi network and say mom you got to move that device or whatever
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.180]   No more gambling sites for you mom
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:10.340]   Never think about Wi-Fi again and get yours fixed as soon as tomorrow

[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.220]   Uh, while we're talking about those voice assistants there was some actually good news
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.340]   It's kind of funny because you and I were talking about this on iOS today mica
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.980]   Um, it came out first that amazon if you use the echo
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:38:00.500]   Third party people might be listening and it turns out this is what every voice assistant does because this is how they improve it
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:07.060]   Right they take a percentage a small percentage of the recordings and have humans say well does that match have to train it
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.180]   You have to train it. So then we heard google. Oh, yeah, we do it too
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.100]   And then recently apple came out although you say that the original article
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.140]   Named apple, but nobody paid attention to the guardian road article about it like three weeks later
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:24.820]   But then they paid attention. Well now apple google and amazon have all said okay. We're going to give you ways
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:31.300]   To turn it off apples actually said we're no longer going to use humans to grade and the reason that was an issue
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.140]   I think it's not unreasonable to think that they're going to do that for training but the reason
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.460]   It was an issue as has ever had you used voice assistants? I do every now and then
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.060]   Well, it is every now and then one of them wake up for no apparent reason sure
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:50.020]   My siri does them a home hub is always talking. Yeah, and the problem is that means it heard something it thought was hay
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.420]   slow mo and
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.140]   You know who and
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.500]   Started recording and sending it back and then try to interpret it that
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:05.160]   Those are some of the recordings that might be sent to humans. Yeah, and who knows what that heard right like a passionate
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.900]   Trist
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.780]   I don't know who she is, but she's walking in my house anytime. My dear friend passion
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.780]   Trist that's my chat handle
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:21.540]   Like a passionate Trist actually you're right or an argument or you know, who knows the secret code to my bit
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:28.340]   Wine locker. I don't know right you'd like that information. I'm so pleased if you know siri send it to me
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.260]   Don't rub it in my
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.220]   Painful. Um, so anyway
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:42.900]   This is not new. We knew this there are two takeaways from this one is that these companies are really a bunch of weasels
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.700]   They don't have they don't have morality till they're caught right and then suddenly they're right it's very Facebook of them
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.140]   Right, so and it's and it's true of all of them and the fix is very simple
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.380]   They just make it opt in if you want you know as you're setting it up or whatever they're gonna say
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.500]   Do you mind if we do this xyz some browsers already do that and you'll just choose yes or no and that's the end of it
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.940]   And that'll be fine, but if we expect to get optimal performance out of these voice assistants
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.220]   We need better. We need they need to train it. Yeah, that's part of the process
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:13.060]   Yes, well they need to make a case maybe and and so they could make that case to say look
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.420]   We'd like to make this better you could help us make it better if you opt in but like we should you should know 1% of the recordings
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.860]   Might be heard by humans. We'll do our best to anonymize that opt in large enough everybody to see it perhaps
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.580]   You know that everybody nobody'll opt in that's the problem here. Yeah, they'll just say know that too
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.580]   Some people like it when the other people are tuning into a passionate twist
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.540]   That's gonna really color
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.860]   That's fine. Yeah, but that's gonna mean series really kind of kinky
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.940]   Yeah, well, so we don't want that we want I mean
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.580]   This is part of the problem too is what you're training this stuff with effects the quality of the stuff
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:53.700]   And if only people who like to be I like to be watched are gonna let series watch then that's not gonna give you
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.700]   Complain so much about the performance of Siri and I'm thinking if you don't let people train it
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.140]   Right complain about this is apples problem. They're support. They want to be private
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.980]   That means series never gonna be as good as the other guys who don't mind spying on you
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.340]   I think that there will be nerds
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:18.340]   Who aren't so much I think there's like there's a there's a mid nerd and I kind of consider myself in that group because there's a far
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:23.060]   Nerd and the far nerd is like I will never let any sort of Wi-Fi thing in my house
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.540]   I don't even let my dogs get on the internet, but a mid nerd
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.180]   Like me I'm okay with
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.500]   Siri hearing the passionate Tris. No, I'm okay with Siri hearing
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   And who cares if somebody hears that that you don't know far away and they well some people do and that's fine
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.420]   I'm just saying I'm okay with that. So I think you're gonna have a nice group of mid nerds
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.420]   What's the next?
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.820]   What's the high?
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.980]   I'm a far nerd. I turn every time it says I see yes to everything
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:02.340]   There's got to be another nerd then what's the one where you don't have any concerns at all? Oh, that's a non nerd
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.820]   No, I'm a regular consumer
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:10.740]   Yeah, that's a regular consumer, but you're you're a mid nerd you know, but you say yes anyway as the regular consumer
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.020]   I want to be a special nerd. Okay. See he doesn't just want to be right
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.220]   All right, there's the leo nerd
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.300]   There's the leo who will every time it says when you will like to send
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.540]   Information back to app developers help to make it better. That's one of the jim marks. I say yeah
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.900]   Every time you turn that off it depends on what I'm using selfish
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.380]   I also don't send it to developers
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.140]   I'll send it back to the to apple, but I don't do the developer one really
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:39.460]   Yeah
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:46.340]   We talked about this a little bit on iOS today because there it's the way that they collect it for developers that makes me uncomfortable
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.100]   Um the the crashes and things like that go through
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.740]   From what i've been told a different system than the way that apple gets the data back
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.580]   And i'm not trustworthy of the company that helps with that
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.500]   Developers there's a that's why I say no i don't care
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.860]   So you're you're a leo nerd i'm the peak under my kimono nerd
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.420]   Um
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:15.060]   But part of it depends on what you do for living and what your life is like so you're i'm on camera every day
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:20.580]   Everything like you're you're very open and public, but if you're in financial services or if you were oh, yeah
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:27.060]   I respect that if you're if you're a drug dealer if you stole tires for a living by the way all three are the same profession
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.140]   Exactly. It's it's a fine line. Yeah
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.700]   Between that and podcasting but I mean
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:39.780]   Some people are you know, they're they're psychiatrists or whatever and they they really have to have a lot of privacy
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.220]   And that makes a lot of sense in a way it's ironic because if somebody's hearing anything
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.980]   I any passionate Trists of mine. They're gonna recognize my voice possible. All right. I mean, oh listen what I got from leo
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.180]   That's true
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:55.620]   The kind of people who are who are looking at these things are the kind of people who would be listening and watching to this podcast
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.180]   Could you send me those recordings?
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.700]   Uh, and if you if you hear my bitcoin wallet password go floating through please
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.460]   By the way, you will not be able to buy bitcoin with the apple credit card
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.260]   Oh, that was a nice thing. No. Yeah, I do like that
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.980]   You are pro
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:18.100]   No cryptocurrencies no casino gaming chips no racetrack wagers. No lottery tickets
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.260]   Can I get more? You cannot play the ponies darn it
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.060]   One of the cool things about this I think is that you
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:30.740]   Essentially establish your relationship with the apple credit card through the wallet app on on the iPhone
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.260]   So you basically say yeah, I don't want to apply for this and it all goes through that app
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.460]   And then the credit card when you're approved and all that stuff just shows up in there
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:42.340]   Right and then in the mail you get a titanium card that has no number on it exactly just your name
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.180]   And the card will actually cut glass. Oh, you don't normally get the card
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.820]   I think you don't say I like the card. I remember them talking on stage ww
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.820]   Do you see that that's an opt-in?
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.020]   The card is for people don't have a watch or a phone. They can't use apple pay. They want you to use apple pay
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.900]   This is really the whole point of the credit card is use apple pay
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.540]   I don't think you can get it without a phone though, right?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.380]   How I don't know I guess you'd have to but I think it's just for people who like to use
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.460]   But there are places you can't use apple pay so that you might want a credit card for
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.620]   Though there's it isn't a especially good deal in any respect
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:19.300]   The only reason you might want is for privacy and also to look at me. I have an apple card
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.020]   They're giving discounts
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:30.500]   We should we should devote a whole hour of the show to breach of the week there's about eight this week including
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.860]   Capital one. Yep, I almost even don't report on breaches anymore because it's like well
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:42.820]   It's old news. It's the second it happens is old news. The capital one is a big breach this time
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.260]   Was it a hundred million? Yeah
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:52.020]   But then there's the e3 website which in a way this affects me more than capital one because it's only 2,000
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:57.060]   Names, but it's of reporters and content creators and people who got credentials to see the e3 gaming show
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.700]   And your home phone number
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.820]   leaked
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.380]   Okay, e3's removed the file, but the data is still
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.460]   circulating
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:10.340]   Capital one they caught the woman who did it and what's still unknown is exactly
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.780]   What she did it looks like from the indictment
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.100]   she had somehow got an account a
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.740]   service account for capital one
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.580]   and so
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:28.100]   That means and so this is the question capital one says no no no we encrypt all that data, but
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:35.380]   Yes, what was it 200,000 credit cards? I mean social security numbers were really something like that
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.940]   Um, well, how did they have the social security numbers? Well, this is the question
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.460]   I'm in reading up a little bit from different security experts and their guesses
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.620]   One way a lot of companies in quote and I'm gonna put this in air quotes encrypt
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:53.140]   They do a hard drive encryption, but if you have an account if you have a customer service account, you're in
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.780]   It's not encrypted. You can exfiltrate the whole thing and it's thought maybe that's what happened
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.260]   Yeah, what they're supposed to do what they should do, but it's hard
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.900]   It's complex. It slows down everything is end-to-end encryption individual encryption of every
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:10.820]   Bit of data didn't the young lady sort of go on like reddit or something and say hey, just bragging
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:15.380]   Look at what I did, you know had no no idea the ramifications of it
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.860]   Or just just that bowl to brag about the breach. I was told some years ago by this
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.980]   some gentleman at the treasury department that
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.900]   That's generally how you get caught
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.540]   If you shut up
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.020]   All right and disappear you don't get caught but hackers a lot of these guys are not doing it
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.980]   They're doing it either for the laws or for the credit, you know the street cred
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.500]   Exactly. They want to they go into chat rooms and they say you know what I did
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.380]   Pushing her hacker friends. Yeah, and so that's how you get caught. So just a little tip
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:53.620]   Uh, you're gonna hack somebody don't don't run you but I don't think she cared. I don't think she wanted that information, right?
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:59.860]   The way that yeah the way that it kind of talks about the after when it's made statements on social media
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.420]   But then she recognizes that she has acted illegally
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.620]   Oops
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.580]   She's gonna really recognize it soon and that orange jumpsuit is not very attractive
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.940]   Um, so there's this is a brian craves, of course who has very good
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:24.660]   Security guy he says interviews with almost a dozen security experts including one who knows about the ongoing breach investigation
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:31.700]   According to that source the problem said from a misconfigured open source web application firewall
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:38.020]   That capital one was using as part of its operations on amazon web services. This is a huge issue
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.700]   It wasn't figured amazon web services all over the place
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:47.860]   Show the AWS it was more on capital one side. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't that AWS did anything wrong
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.380]   It's just that and this happens all the time
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:54.340]   It was I'll set up a ws buckets or accounts and they don't they don't lock it all down properly
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.780]   And uh, so mod security was the waff
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:04.420]   Uh that was deployed along with the open source apache web server to provide protections against several classes of vulnerabilities
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.420]   But the misconfiguration
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.220]   Allowed the intruder to trick the firewall
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:17.860]   Into relaying requests to a key back end resource on the AWS platform the metadata service is responsible for heading out temporary information
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.940]   Uh
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.940]   Including credentials
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.940]   So she was able to get credentials
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:32.100]   Geez, yeah, and then uh, it was so it's it's a great piece if you're if you really want to know the technical details
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.900]   Uh brian got it down
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.780]   They they said he said they used a server side request forgery attack
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.660]   Uh, the waff was tricked into running commands. It should not have been permitted to run
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:51.940]   Including talking to the metadata. That's where she got credentials once she got the credentials. She logged in everything was unencrypted
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.340]   Uh, you know nice hack
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.820]   One one one one slightly humorous
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:06.180]   After effect of this is that suddenly on the job boards, uh capital one is advertising a whole bunch of security jobs
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.940]   I hope people were players. Yeah, yeah, so I hope people were were fired
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.220]   Uh long as we're talking about uh security
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.100]   issues your
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.900]   iPhone is wild broadcasting information about you with bluetooth le
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:29.380]   Uh, this is a it's a great, uh headline the hexway.io apple ble
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.740]   Bluetooth LA everyone knows what happens on your iphone
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.620]   And I I discovered this the other day. Lisa and I were riding our bikes playing
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.740]   A harry potter and I have a very oh boy
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.700]   This could even get more nerdy
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.140]   And I have a very uh, I have a nerdy helmet phone
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.940]   Bluetooth
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.180]   Bluetooth helmet phone and and I had forgotten to pair
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.900]   My phone to my bluetooth helmet phone
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   And so I turned on pairing on my iphone as i'm riding around where we're going 15 miles an hour through town
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.660]   And then I looked down to see all I could see
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:13.620]   Hundreds of stereos speakers. All right, all this stuff broadcasting bluetooth
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:22.740]   le identity somebody could see a helmet it's like that's including my helmet but I could have I could have played music into these speakers easily because
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:27.940]   Blue tooth lee is designed to be zero configuration so you don't have to do the pairing frame
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:33.620]   But as a result many of our devices are just saying hey i'm here what you what hey hello
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.180]   Heck we should try should try it right now. It's
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:42.500]   It actually makes it made it really hard to pair my helmet phone. I couldn't even find a list was so long
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.180]   That's scary
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.980]   So uh, here's the issue according to hexway
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.500]   um
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.940]   If you have an appropriate software to take a look at what's going on an attacker
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:59.540]   Could there they're only going to initially get some limited information about your phone number
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.540]   But they could if they see your phone number more than once and get the hash more than once
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:10.340]   Recover the phone number. They can get other information your iphone talks about what operating system the phone status
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:16.500]   Wi-Fi status not the i am ei. I don't think buffer availability
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:22.820]   Uh, and it's not just your iphone your macbook apple watchin airpods all the apple stuff is doing this it's beacon
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:27.460]   And and honestly, I think this is part of remember when apple was big on beacons
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.420]   That's what i was gonna ask i'm not the biggest security person
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:35.940]   But I remember back when beacons was a big story from everybody was like no we don't want to do that
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.660]   It was a flot
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:40.260]   It's the idea is you'd walk into a store the beacon and the store is on the pair of pants
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.060]   You'd walk in your iphone and say hey this pair of pants is on sale. All right
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:49.780]   But in order for that to work blue tooth le it have to be the pants are beaconing your phones open and receiving
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.300]   Turns out we found this out at wwdc
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.900]   Every apple device is also a beacon. Yeah. Oh man
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:02.260]   So they haven't completely gotten rid of beacons either because they've just recently
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.460]   Made available. It's a developer
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:13.380]   Feature and it's an app that you can get in the app store that sets up helps you go around and set up beacons in a in a place
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.300]   So they have not get gotten rid of that
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.660]   It's just sort of been buried i think for a little while while they were getting all this figured out
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:24.740]   Because even in this article it talks about how older devices do not do this no this is modern
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.820]   Yeah, and so this is a convenience
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:31.940]   It's exactly the batteries can finally kind of take it the the bluetooth version that they have etc
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:40.500]   But beacons are i think we're going to continue to see more of those especially as these indoor maps continue to move different places
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.940]   Yeah
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.580]   This is it's such a challenge and this is where being a
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:51.140]   What kind of nerd am I a mid nerd a mid nerd your leo nerd? Yeah, but you're the special
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.460]   I'm starting to rethink my nerdiness because
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:54:01.860]   I just I feel like there's more leaking than we could possibly even really understand like trying to plug all these holes
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.700]   Yeah, and it's maybe be prudent to be a far nerd to be a far nerd now
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.020]   Before it's too late. You know i'm saying I started using firefox turning on
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:19.460]   https dns over it's only about that search engine to use start page instead of google because it anonymizes the
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:24.500]   It's the same google results, but anonymized start using firefox instead of chrome
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.140]   I
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.380]   I'm not a paranoid anti privacy guy. I'm not i'm not a tin foil hat guy
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.940]   But i'm starting to think I have my moment. It's gonna be hard to back to walk this back
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.380]   Right, you know that all right right now. It's fine
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.420]   But my five years from now and there's this massive database of information about me
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.460]   Is that gonna be an issue?
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.460]   It's ai gets better and
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:52.420]   They can process gazillions of uh, I think you should turn this whole studio into a fair day cage
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.340]   Yeah, that'd be great
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.500]   The ones you know how people would complain if they came in here and know their devices work to be something
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.500]   I can't play harry potter
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:05.140]   I want to play harry potter. All right. I'm going to talk about face recognition because this is another area where
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:09.940]   I we're the frog in the boiling water. It's sitting it's starting down. It's getting hot in here
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.180]   So hot so hot
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:16.020]   But first I want to whiten my teeth. You don't mind during the middle of the show be my guest
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:22.820]   Have at it sir. I love these. These are this is the crest 3d white strips. These are freaking awesome
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.420]   You can go to the dentist and spend hundreds of dollars to do this
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.180]   My son my son. He's 25. He said dad get me some of those
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.300]   Said henry your teeth are white. He said no, I got a what did he say?
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.260]   I'm pre-gaming for outside outdoor outside lands
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.020]   He's getting ready for the big outside lands festival and he wants to have white teeth
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.580]   Said perfect all you need is a week you get one of these seven of these pouches
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.380]   This is the white strip. It's the same treatment dentists use but you do it in your home for a fraction of the cost
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.620]   I'll show you how this works. Just because I think everybody wants to know. These are the strips
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.980]   It's hydrogen peroxide. Okay, and they're in a gel form
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.060]   That you peel them off
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:03.380]   You now get a tv show you an hour long tv show you want to watch. That's my recommendation
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.420]   We watch breaking bad. I'll hit this on
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:12.260]   Okay, that's it. There you go. That's it. It's on put them on your lower teeth. I can still talk
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.740]   I wouldn't eat popcorn. No
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:23.060]   Peanut butter is right out. Yeah, forget that but okay. They're whitening right now. Okay. Okay. I just put that on there
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.620]   Don't laugh
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.820]   You'll be laughing out of the earth. Sorry. My teeth are shining so white
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.540]   Anyway, you get the idea
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.940]   And uh, and so you leave there for an hour. Okay
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.020]   and then
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.700]   tv show ends
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.060]   Hours up
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.660]   You take out this is this is the thing that makes these 3d white strips really work
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.580]   It's an led blue led light and it has a little timer in it
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.580]   You had me at led
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:53.220]   Once once you're done you leave this trip on but you put the blue led light and it shines
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:57:01.300]   Light and it whitens your teeth even further. It gets all the really deep stains from smoking from coffee coffee whiskey
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.940]   Not whiskey coffee. You guys could fit cigar once in a red wine. I don't smoke them. I just
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.500]   Speaking of bluetooth. I just choose
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.860]   This is literally bluetooth
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:18.660]   And your and that target sustains makes the ingredients work faster. This actually the dentist also use these led blue white technology

[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:29.620]   And i'm gonna make it even better for you. In fact when i told henry he said can you get me one of these i said you right now
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:33.940]   You get $20 off if you see uppercut to it. He said, okay deal. That's a big savings

[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.620]   Um
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.020]   What was I gonna I was gonna show a recognition? Oh
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   Okay a couple of uh
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.860]   A couple of developments in the annals of face recognition. There's a uk company called ai bar
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:31.780]   That when you walk into the bar they have I guess the idea is they're gonna
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.340]   They're gonna paint a strip
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.700]   On the floor or something that says stand here if you want to be recognized
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:40.980]   I
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.980]   There's no yeah
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.300]   I thought I just did it as you walked up to the counter
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.020]   Yeah, well
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:50.180]   If you don't well the point is if you didn't want to you could stand outside that zone
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:57.700]   But you're ain't gonna get served because the way this works is the if ai bar recognizes your face and adds you to the queue
[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.780]   Oh, here comes mica
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.580]   And if it knows your drink again, it will have you drink ready again. That's good
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.180]   It will charge you automatically the bartender can
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.900]   Change it if you want you want to you could say remove me from your database the bartender could do that
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:17.060]   But the idea and honestly, this is what a good bartender does right
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:22.340]   Recognize his use as i'll have you makes you feel good keeps track. You spent a lot of money. It's good tip
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:27.700]   Lot of money a survey commissioned by data spark has 2000 drinkers
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.580]   A lot of money what their biggest complaint is about bars. What do you think?
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:38.660]   Uh, I can't get a drink. Yeah, 80% of those say it's people pushing in at the bar queue is true
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.380]   Because i'm not a pushy type and lisa says go get me a glass of wine
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.940]   I've never been to bars where i have to push people. Yeah, neither have I I don't know what this world is
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:51.460]   Jared when i walk in people just sort of part. Oh, that's you
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.860]   Look at me. They look at me. They go out of my way
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.820]   So, uh, this would help that
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.500]   People uh, the Brits like to queue so they're
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.420]   Look
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.540]   There's a Brits like the like to queue. Here's see the picture
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.980]   They got numbers over their heads so the bartender goes are you number two?
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.780]   I'm not like i can tell those people are not waiting for a drink in a bar. Look at them
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:21.060]   Number two frankly doesn't look happy number two either needs a drink or that somebody's been designated as number two
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.220]   Nobody likes that. Why did I get number two?
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.980]   All right, so that's i think that's i don't think this is a problematic use of face recognition
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.940]   The company says we don't store these more than 24 hours
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.900]   That would be potentially a problem like well
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:41.140]   We see leo at the bar every night and that gets sent to the insurance company. That's not good
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.740]   Well, this this actually mirrors another company that i'm writing about for face
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:50.180]   for for fast company actually um called patron scans one of the companies i'm writing about
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:55.140]   Uh, and what they do is they card your card when you walk in they can recognize hundreds of different
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:01.060]   Ids they can tell if you're old enough or the fake id whether it's been used before but you can be blacklisted by the bar
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.260]   And when you're blacklisted by the bar you're blacklisted by all the bars
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.180]   Whoa, no they use patron scan and they got into trouble in california
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.540]   I think that's great. I like it. If you're gay. What do you have to do to get blacklisted by a bar?
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.620]   It's got to be
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.020]   That's the problem. It's not looking at me like that michael
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.020]   You just keep you
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.820]   No, i'm like, well, what has he done because i need
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.300]   No
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:31.460]   And and so it's it's a it's a problem because they're retaining the data the personal data on people for months and months and
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:37.620]   It's actually it's an international company. It's actually a canadian company in there in the uk us in australia
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.100]   If you're banned in detroit
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.780]   You can't get a drink in the uk because it's part of the system. No, i got no problem with that
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.100]   Okay, but but somebody has a bad breakup and they put their girlfriend on the on the list
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.500]   Well that would block us for life from all bars
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.220]   She should come over here because we've got cognac
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.300]   And we don't have face right there are certainly some concerns with that
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.700]   All face recognition has the potential problem of yes, yeah, but
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:10.260]   Well face recognition the problem with it is that you can you can both scan and capture somebody's
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.180]   Biometrics from half a mile away with a camera. Yeah, anybody can do it. Yep
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:19.060]   Your face is available out there. Did you see the new technology the laser technology that can detect your heart?
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:24.500]   Yes from half a mile away and turns out your heart beat is as distinctive as your fingerprint
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.460]   That's right. So positive idea is going to be trivially easy
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:34.420]   Um, but uh recently wrote a column about this because there's a lot of confusion in the enterprise space about whether company should embrace
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.740]   face recognition for authentication and
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:43.620]   Authorization and my take is yes all these controversies about the consumer use of with controls
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:50.740]   Well, there's a difference between so that people are like san francisco and three other cities have banned face recognition by the police
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.220]   And it's because face recognition is biased basically it it it uh
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:02.340]   So it has more positives with african-americans with women women exactly and partly that's that thing we were talking about with not enough
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.900]   Not enough training for yeah, exactly and and companies are coming along with that and there there's a
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:15.540]   A woman who's been driving this and her research. I think she's in the uk has been influencing companies like microsoft and apple and google not amazon
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.420]   uh, but um
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:25.540]   This is a totally separate discussion from whether this is good authentication technology within an enterprise for access to various areas for
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.940]   Digital access to to certain databases, etc. It's a totally separate thing
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.580]   So I say if you're in the enterprise space, which I know a lot of the listeners are and a lot of viewers are
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:42.900]   Go for it. These these these controversies aren't you worried about consumer backlash? There is a consumer backlash, but again, I think the consumer backlash is about
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:47.540]   Bias, it's about harvesting people people's faces without their permission
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.700]   It's not about employees working insensitive with sensitive business data. We're trying to get access to like the clean room, etc, etc
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:58.020]   That's a totally separate thing and I think that's a legitimate and valuable use for
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.660]   Face recognition. So that's my two cents. You got to separate here's a great HBO show
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:08.260]   Six episodes called years at year after year. It's about it's a dis to vary dystopian future
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.980]   Uh, I don't know
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.980]   I know it's interesting
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:17.060]   Because everything is so so but what they talk about is uh
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:21.140]   And actually uh, Neil Stevenson's latest novel also talks about
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.540]   Prevalent use of stuff to disguise your face. Yes, and I just realized there's a new business for crest
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:33.220]   We're gonna call it the 3d. Yeah reverse it face blurring kit. Nice. That's right
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:40.340]   Around it'll foil it turns out, you know juggalos juggalos insane clown posse
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   so
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.980]   Apparently just go to insane
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:54.660]   Insane clown posse so you know the paint the face paint the juggalos do the weird face paint turns out it foils if foils face recognition
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.660]   All right, so get ready because the future's gonna be full of people with insane clown posse
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.940]   I recommend
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.940]   Tattoos on your face. Yeah
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:06.980]   Tuts that you can put off it's like a peel and stick. Yeah, stick and peel stick and peel
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.940]   Yeah, don't take chances get the tattoo. I think this is called years and years
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:14.420]   It is a awesome show if you want to watch it. It is the most depressing show I've ever watched
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.540]   Oh good. I would love to watch that and they tack a happy ending on it the last five minutes
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.620]   Just so you don't kill yourself
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.220]   But it's honest lose viewers the sad thing is
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:28.660]   It's it's it's again the frog in the boiling water
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.260]   It starts in the present and just builds on what's already happening
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.380]   And it says you know, you know in 10 years what's gonna be like, you know in 20 years. What's gonna be like? Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.540]   So frog
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.660]   boiling water
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.180]   Are you in the pot?
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.180]   China is now eliminating face
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.780]   QR codes for face recognition in payments
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.340]   So
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.060]   Japan and china jumped on this. We're now getting on the QR code bandwagon, right? I saw it the other day
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.060]   I saw a street musician
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.580]   With a QR code on his violin case and has said venmo me
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:05.380]   And you could instead of putting money in the violin case. It was just here in petaluma. You
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.780]   Yeah, that's an entrepreneurial spirit. That is really brilliant
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:16.020]   So that is that's been around in Asia for a long time now the newest thing. This is from the south china morning post
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.900]   QR codes on their way out
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.660]   uh face
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.860]   recognition
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.540]   And so what you'll do and there's two there's competing systems one from alipay
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.500]   Which is alipay, but it's kind of payment platform the other from we chat
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:35.460]   Um, you see right here the picture alip. This is alipay smile to pay. Okay. There's a tablet
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.860]   There's a camera on it
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:44.500]   And if you walk up to it, this is at ces a couple of years ago and actually I think but I seem to remember there were a couple of mcdonald's stores using
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:51.460]   A google smile to pay. Do you remember that in silicon valley? No. Yeah, I think a couple of years ago google did this at silicon valley
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.740]   Oh no
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.900]   I pictured this like you're out to lunch with your friends and you're splitting the bill and it's like now hold on
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:03.300]   I just got to get your face in okay, and do you pay your ten dollars? So this is like a i don't even i just square
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.420]   Carve as well. Yeah, you have a somebody else's face on a stick and you put it
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:13.140]   Grandpa's getting this one for me today. Well a lot of this comes down to how well face recognition works
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:19.460]   Right false positives a problem, especially when you're talking about a preening. Yeah only a matter of time before it's essentially perfect though
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:24.100]   So, you know going I have to think that's the case right it's coming. Yeah, it's gonna be perfect
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.180]   And when you talk about google solely yeah
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.220]   We are with the way they are
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:34.260]   And all that there's two reasons google's doing that one because maybe it'll some more pixel four models
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.300]   But the other what they're gathering data, right? Yep. Yep. This is well
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:43.940]   I think we talked about this on twit last time I was on I think this is why the amazon robot in order to navigate your house
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   It has to scan everything in the house
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:51.220]   But did that make sense and all this incidental scanning is going to be useful in a database just like voice
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:56.740]   Data is now they're gathering it to improve it. No, by the way, we have this terabyte of data
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:03.380]   What else could we do it? It was very controversial when rumba was doing that sending it back and there was some issue about where that
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.860]   3d map went yeah
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.660]   Like all the only thing that really needs it is the rumba itself
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.220]   There's no reason to send it back to the home office, but it was
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:15.780]   And there was some concern that maybe amazon was using it to figure out what you're so far
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:19.220]   Maybe there is a reason maybe they need to figure out their algorithm on
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.260]   Better how to turn that corner just right?
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.820]   What if i'm having a
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.140]   Passionate Trist that's the word that's the phrase
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.100]   Showtidal the phrase yes
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.180]   What is that blob in the middle of the living room floor there a passionate
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:41.380]   Room but i'm probably in the minority, but I think that the rumba should actually analyze the dna that it vacuums up
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.300]   Minority it could it could it totally could
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:51.860]   This is why I think there are so many dystopian future tv shows because there's so many dystopian possible
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:59.620]   Things choose your distocia. I just want to get the parts i want my robot to fold my laundry for me
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.860]   And then i'll give you my DNA
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:08.260]   No, this this one from amazon will it because i remember there was one that was going to do that and it was so much work
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.340]   It was so bad
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.340]   So bad
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:16.500]   For two years yes, it was just like a box with nothing inside and it was like
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.540]   A tiny person
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:26.660]   Somebody asked me about that at CES and i just laughed at almost like why this is no point in this thing
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:33.460]   I'll announce it here. I I felt so bad last year that I wasn't at CES you go every year you're going this year already
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.580]   Yes, sir. We're a protect republic. Let's all go to CES this year. Oh, what do you say bring your truck?
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.340]   She's like says no
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:45.300]   Well, you i'm just i'm not shaking my head because it's like it's get Leo drinking next things talking crazy
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.460]   We're gonna do see if we've already
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.180]   We've already decided this john and started been decided. I thought that's why i left
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.140]   We're not
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.540]   You guys go to ces i'll go to ces with you
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.940]   Okay, we're not gonna do the big boo
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:04.340]   We're not gonna do the big booth that we've done in years past that was like hundreds of thousands of hours
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:10.260]   We'll do street podcasting. Yeah, we'll go out and set up a booth on the gorilla. Can't we do gorilla?
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:14.100]   That's what we remember when i went to south by south west and i can
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:19.780]   Our model pod like camera on it. Yeah, that was gorilla. The whole thing was i'm just gonna go
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:24.820]   I'm not gonna bring a team. It's gonna be me. That's how you got banned from apple events too gorilla podcasting
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.780]   Brilliant possibly go wrong
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   I want to do that again. I like that does sound fun
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:36.420]   I'm one of the few people that enjoy going to see you love us every year now granted
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.340]   I may sleep about two hours a night, which is about half of what i sleep
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:45.700]   That's what almost killed me last time. I think it's so much fun. It's a lot of work, but it's you know
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.780]   One reason i want to go and it's actually a very controversial the boring company
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.980]   So elan musk is boring see their whole
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.500]   boring holes underneath the convention center in las vegas
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:00.420]   The las vegas convention centers already given them tens of millions of dollars
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.300]   There will be they're going to be teslas
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.860]   Especially modified teslas underneath i want to see that it's like a subway system
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.980]   But there's some controversy the people on the mono rail
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:19.060]   Above the ground are mad at the boring company saying you're going to disturb the pillars that hold up the mono rail
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.980]   live in the future and then the mono rail can't conflict between the mono rail people and the
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.780]   Tenders and the mono rail can't have their
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.980]   Hovercraft people don't care at all
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.140]   The drones are the jet i
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:38.340]   I knowing elan i predict there will be at least a test a demo version of the whole
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.980]   That we can guess of course
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:47.780]   Count me everyone hates customer service. It says the wall street journal. This is why technology
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:53.540]   Let's companies see how badly they can treat consumers right up to the moment they bolt
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.740]   So there's two ways you can use the data you're getting
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:05.780]   On your call center and your call tree you could either say oh, let's make this a better experience because people are miserable or
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.420]   How miserable can we make them?
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:15.540]   Before they leave i mean this is before you're trying to tell me you haven't had a client that you just
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:21.940]   Raised a rate yeah, but if you're at and you hate all your clients. What is the business?
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.980]   Some companies now kip call centers. This is the journal
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.540]   I think it's you know more of a kind of a fluffy piece
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:34.820]   But it makes kind of makes sense anybody who's ever been on a call tree knows how horrible these are worst
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:41.380]   Uh, some companies now kip call centers with software that analyzes a callers tone of voice and pace of speech
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.260]   To determine how upset the person is
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.860]   Angry or so this is a tip
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.500]   Your ai pro tip start getting excited
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:57.220]   Angry or call is get routed to angel agent skilled at de escalating conflict and they're warned this guy's pissed
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.940]   I think this is exactly what's always going on right?
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.140]   But there's been around this type of thing has been around for a long time
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.100]   I've learned that if you just say the word litigation
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:12.180]   Litigation, you know what i've learned if you're really nice and treat the person like a human being
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.500]   You go right through a lot of that too, but a lot of you works a lot
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.260]   Human being before you can get to that
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.740]   I just hit zero zero zero zero star star star star star star star star star
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:30.740]   A lot of our listeners work and call service centers. Mm-hmm. They're csrs. They're answering phones
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:36.420]   It's a very I mean, it's the number one geek job probably the millions and it's a tough gig and I have every
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.500]   sympathy for this hard
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:43.460]   I answer people's phone calls for six hours a week on the radio. Mm-hmm, and that's a nightmare
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:52.340]   Wait a minute. I pretend I enjoy it, but it's a ron. Yeah, whoops. Uh, no, they're great
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:56.260]   So when I need this so listen to what this is this is what they do
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.420]   um
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.380]   Affinity, which is a company that makes call center software
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:07.780]   Crunches data gleaned from consumers demographic profiles credit scores and past interactions with a company
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:15.460]   So they've got this database you call in they know who you are they determine which customer service agent is the best fit it's dating
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:21.460]   An algorithm then matches the caller to the agent who has had the most success with that type. Oh my god
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.540]   What do you mean you people?
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540]   I
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:31.140]   Just I'm speechless
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:37.460]   This is probably every time you call a call center now. Mm-hmm probably going on right? Oh, that's oh, that's aunt
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.860]   Send them over. We know yeah, it goes
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.220]   In person. Yeah
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:51.300]   And then just as data could be used to measure consumers threshold for bad service
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   It also helps pinpoint which shoppers are most profitable and therefore worth the effort and expense to please
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:03.700]   So this explains a lot because it used to be you could call up and say I'm leaving your company unless you make it good
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.620]   Right more and more. I'm hearing people say I did that and they said, okay
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.980]   Yeah, you know call it chicken
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:17.620]   Yeah, it might not work who pioneered this was Netflix back in the day when they would mail you a dvd
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.940]   right they actually would
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   the more movies you ordered the
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.500]   less
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:30.020]   Available were the movies you wanted so if you ordered ordered one movie a month you would always get it
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   But if you ordered like six movies a month you'd have to wait and it'd be months months and months of wait
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:39.300]   Because they wanted to get rid of you right because they're paying for the postage and all that kind of stuff the more you ordered
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.980]   If you ordered more than five movies a month or something they were losing money on you
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.300]   I mean that was really what they want. Yeah
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   They always wanted was somebody who would rent a movie and not return it for months exactly
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.700]   Well, that was a perfect customer. Yeah, so they paid you enough fees
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.260]   And you pay the same monthly fees
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:01.140]   It's like the library. They've always wanted that right? You keep those books as long as you want
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:06.500]   A lot of places are all the libraries are stopping that now though. No, I'm kidding. I don't think the library really wanted you to do that
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.940]   I feel like they got a lot of money on there. Oh, man. Those late fees. I'll tell you this library is just rolling in cash
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.020]   Here's another one
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.580]   I'm sorry
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:24.020]   Uh, it turns out that maybe the person you think and that companies think would be the best for the customer service lines are not
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.100]   There's a disconnect between what companies think customers want and what they actually want
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.860]   It's most common for customer service agents to be empathetic
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.900]   That's that's they're looking for somebody's empathetic. No
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:42.580]   We don't want that an analysis of how well customer service agents perform a personality type known as a controller
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.900]   Someone who has outspoken and opinionated did far better
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:52.020]   Only 2% of managers said they would consider hiring such a person
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:57.540]   But it turns out customers want to deal with somebody who is smarter than they are and will fix the problem
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.340]   Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna fix it. Oh those guys. I'll tell you what yeah
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:09.860]   I got oh, I'm so sorry. They always say that now and I hate that when they said they're just like no, you're not you have a script
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.780]   Yeah, I used to manage a service desk years ago and
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:20.980]   The biggest tip that I gave them first of all was just shut up and listen just good. Just let the support person just
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:27.220]   Get it off your call is so important to us. Thank you so much for being here corporate gave me a script
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.300]   I never saw the script later, you know
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:34.420]   But we just just shut up and listen and let the customer say what's wrong and once you're done
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.900]   Didn't you do your job and they were always happier after that, you know because they knit first of all
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:44.100]   You're not going to get a phone call. What are they just like? Hey, this is a great day be alive
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:51.220]   For some reason I can't connect to the internet. It's just awesome. No, they're always going to call you in a bad mood
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:56.260]   You know and you had to be able to deal with that. So I've always said to defuse it just shut up
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:00.980]   Let them get it off the fence. Try that on your radio show. Yeah, I do
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:06.340]   Today I'm sitting. I'm not proud of oh boy
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.940]   I can't wait to watch the we were kind of droning on
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:15.700]   And on and I was running out of time because you know it's a network show you you saw this Zach, right? You were there and
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:21.780]   That I'm looking at the clock 10 nice. So I just started the music starts to come. I just faded him out
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:26.340]   I didn't say anything. I just oh, no, I just faded him out. We went to commercial. No

[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.380]   I have them. They're called hearing aids. It's right. You just turn them off and they're just
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:53.060]   At least it goes. Did you hear me? What? I don't have a hearing aid and you can ask Phoebe. She tells you I turn my volume

[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.380]   So I guess those are washed

[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.180]   It's me where we're going why we're going how can we be?
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.180]   I was thinking about bob hopey on it
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.900]   and I I think nobody
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.340]   He was the one of the biggest stars of my youth. Yeah
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:04.420]   Remember he'd come on johnny karston and like show up to a pop in and every go crazy. Yeah
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.140]   Do you know who bob hopis?
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:09.860]   No, you don't seriously
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.180]   This is how old are you?
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.740]   It's unknown
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.460]   Honestly, I realizing that a lot of the heroes of my 20s when I was mica's age
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:23.620]   Are not even known anymore. Yeah, but it goes both ways
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:28.180]   Because a lot of the heroes of your generation. Yeah, like do you know jina?
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.180]   Carbons
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.900]   No, I do but she's not nearly as funny as bob hop. Did you get invited to the
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:40.100]   Malibu instagram influencers party? I don't know people of my generation
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:47.940]   The thing I don't know anybody who's who they're stuck in a time war I was I was looking at this article Taylor lorence wrote a
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.780]   a great
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.020]   Peace on it and I guess it's the Atlantic
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.420]   And which she talks about I didn't even know this existed
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:03.620]   Uh, the piece was called where everyone's an influencer inside instagram's annual beach party
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:09.460]   Oh wow where hollywood and social media collide. It's a glad stones mallebon old timey seafood restaurant
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.780]   And i'm looking at these pictures of all these gorgeous young people
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.740]   Meg d'allangelis was 1.7 million followers on instagram
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:23.140]   Brent revera former viner with 15 million followers on instagram
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:28.820]   Eva gut koski 6.8. I have no idea who any of these people are
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:33.780]   Koski you don't know eva gut koski did tray ratcliffe lead the first angry comment on yeah
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:39.700]   I know i bet he did he of course wrote the book about how crazy this has gotten to me that sounds like a comedy
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   Right a bunch of narcissistic
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.420]   Influences all together
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:51.620]   They're talking to each other. These are baby coconuts branded with the instagram icon. That just makes me sick
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:59.140]   I feel like this. I don't know. Uh, that's specifically not this whole thing. That's fine coconut abuse. Yep. Yes. No
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.860]   It's also fake
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:09.380]   At three i love the lead at 3 30 p.m on a recent tuesday hundreds of instagram influencers descended on glad stones their entrances followed a script one by one
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:15.620]   They entered the restaurants outdoor terrace immediately whipped out of phone and began taking photos and videos one young woman
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:21.300]   Retraced her step through the entrance four times as a friend filmed her from different angles. That's right
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:29.780]   Another held her for a selfie while twirling a cloud of cotton candy others rushed to the porches ed to take more selfies
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:36.020]   Two boys posed in similar looking tracksuits before one stripped off his hoodie to soak in the 85 degree weather
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.660]   The dj lee lee lee also an instagram influencer lee lee lee
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:50.260]   The crowdward crop tops layers of mesh lots of neon and for roughly 40 percent of the men some form of gucci loafers
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:54.420]   This is not anything I would ever be interested in
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:00.100]   This is this is we had bob hopin bing Crosby. I feel like this is
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.500]   A big cause me. I know big cause I feel like this is post mornio. Isn't it?
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:08.900]   This is something what is the thing after millennials post millennials the end of the world?
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.060]   Yeah, all the actually this is to save the world from us millennials is what I've been
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.700]   That's what I've been well your job is to save the world from us baby boomer
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:21.940]   So you fail this is real so the post millennials have to do it now my younger siblings have to save the world so
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:29.460]   One of the things I should have told you this that every twit host guests or you know it only backup is a cast per mattress
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:34.500]   All right, cool. We have one and I love it. You're already out of it good. I can say maybe you hear that
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.060]   We get a mattress
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.060]   Wait, but you don't want sleeping on the dog bed
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:42.420]   To the mattress. They make a dog bed. You can get one for my dogs if you want to
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:45.940]   Yeah, I know they make great dog. Yeah, you want to sleep on this dog bed. It's a really cool way
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.580]   You know at least explain the cast per dog bed
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:55.540]   So the whole deal of the cast birds these are great mattresses really nice mattresses engineered main in the United States obsessive
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:00.980]   Engineering to make super comfortable mattresses and because they eliminate the mattress store the middleman
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.460]   You get a great price
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.820]   Plus they know that people want to sleep on the mattress so they make a great offer
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.700]   You get to sleep on it for 100 nights and if you don't like it for any reason
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:13.540]   You get all your money back. They come and they get it and you get all your money back
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.820]   Don't they come in right don't they come in like a box or something?
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.180]   Yeah, oh
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.020]   You have the video of me and my mattress
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:26.660]   So this is a this is a california king. You're just missing the candle and the the cat
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:32.740]   California king every time we get a new cast where I do the same video I even wear the same jammies
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.460]   And um they come in a really compact box
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:39.620]   By the way when when my son went to college we got him a cast because it was so easy to get it upstairs
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.300]   Right and his mattress was disgusting in the dorm. So we really didn't have to get a mattress
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.620]   You open it up the mattress
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:50.100]   Look at that. It's beautiful. It's comfortable and unlike a lot of other mattresses
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.820]   I've bought even for mattress stores. You don't have to air them off and look how
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:59.380]   Look at that. So I'll ask the question that all of america is wondering why didn't you open that up in the bedroom?
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:01.620]   Now you got a
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:04.660]   You have a mattress in the foyer
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.100]   Haven't you
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:13.780]   Isn't this what you really always wanted is a mattress. Oh look in the
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.580]   That's what you see leo on the mattress
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:22.180]   Welcome it's the qhefner dream right a mattress in the foyer
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:28.100]   Casper just introduces. I think this is part of the hybrid mattress collection. This is kind of an interesting thing in the past
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:34.020]   Caspers have had no springs, but they decided there's some people want durable yet gentle springs
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:39.860]   This has it right uh, which offers luxurious comfort, but also resilient support elevated lift
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:44.900]   So the support's kind of active and durable for all body types. This is really great for me and Lisa
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.340]   I'm a little heavier than Lisa
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:50.900]   So having the extra kind of independent lift is really great
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.220]   She gets to sleep but she wants I get as what I want
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.100]   The spring network gives you even better airflow
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:00.260]   So that helps because sleeping cool is so important. I know you're a sleep expert mica. You do a
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:06.420]   Okay, wait a minute. Yeah, I know I did a podcast on sleep. Well, but see this is a joke that he does a snore
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:11.620]   He's like, oh, you did a podcast. So you're an expert. Oh, it's a joke. I'm serious you pit enhanced
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:20.020]   Okay, so you're really tiny. So you don't experience this. Maybe you do and I know I do have a slight just a little
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.020]   When you get to the edge of the bed
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:27.460]   And and you're trying to get out of bed and the mattress gives it crumples and you just fall out a bit
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:35.060]   Right. There's no graceful way every morning. I'm mattress cries each time these new Casper hybrid mattresses have enhanced edge support
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.300]   a firmer perimeter
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.540]   Which means it's easier to get out of bed nice. I love that
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:45.460]   This is an awesome we call them bezel and technology like a bezel
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.940]   And what was the template edges actually
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.780]   These these are the best mattresses i've ever had my whole family
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:58.020]   Many of our hosts aren't they great casper offers free delivery. So that's easy and painless returns
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.100]   In the us and canada
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:04.580]   100 night risk free sleep sleep on a trial, but I got to tell you you're not going to want to return it
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.140]   You're you're actually good as one one get one for the foyer
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.380]   Even with the springs
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:14.340]   The hybrid mattress and that was one of them comes in that box that magical box that arrives in your doorstep makes it so easy
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:17.700]   Yep, move it to the bedroom before you open it up. I got the casper

[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:10.340]   Nodding off
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:15.700]   Um, are you worried about the ring video doorbell? Have you been seeing this now?
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.620]   This is a former sponsor and I have a ring
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:24.500]   But we're learning vice has been doing a whole series of articles about how local law enforcement is doing deals with
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.060]   Amazon which now owns the ring
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   um
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:34.340]   The law enforcement will get free ring doorbells if they get people to sign up
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:41.860]   And ring is making them. This is a motherboard got an email via public request record request
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:46.100]   Ring has never disclosed the exact number of partnerships it maintains with law enforcement
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:49.860]   But we according to motherboard at least 200 law enforcement agencies
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.820]   This comes from a leak from a law officer that was at a ring webinar
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:00.900]   Uh, so this and this was back in april so it could be more the officer sent the email told mother board
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:06.020]   The email was a transcribed version of handwritten notes. He took during a team webinar with a ring representative april mites
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.820]   ring
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.660]   Trained officers and how to use the law enforcement neighborhood portal
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.620]   Which gives local police a map with approximate locations of all the ring
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.980]   Cameras in your in your jurisdiction
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:26.580]   And lets you request footage directly from the camera owners camera owners do need to consent
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:32.340]   But you don't need a warrant to ask for footage so you could ask hey, I don't see I'm not sure I have a problem with this
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.340]   But that's why i'm i'm asking you guys
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:38.340]   Um, they also are ring is very careful about
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:45.860]   Getting a non-disclosure from law enforcement so the police have to sign a contract saying that they won't talk about this and they won't talk about that
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:49.620]   That's right. Amazon controls it. So it's right kind of a disturbing thing
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:56.980]   That there's also on the ring a neighbor's app right which I use and I've noticed pretty great actually
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:03.380]   Isn't it yeah because it'll tell you like oh there was somebody stalking my neighborhood or there was a breaking down the street although there
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:11.380]   And this is the mother board points this out seems to be a little bit of issue with racial profiling because the stranger is tend to be black every time
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:13.860]   I'm gonna say are people a little over zealous in those little groups
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:19.300]   I think there's a lot of time if you see it's in the middle of the night of black guys walking down your street you posted
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:24.020]   All right in this app is what you're saying, right? And that's not rings fault. That's humans. That's human
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:29.940]   Yeah, so there was I got invited to when I moved into the place where I was living in uh,
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.980]   Springfield, Missouri
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:36.660]   I got an invite to one of those neighbor group things and apps and so I signed I think next door or whatever
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:41.380]   So I signed up for it got it and that's what it ended up being every time was a lot of nervous
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:46.020]   Activity and it's not suspicious activity and nothing ever happened. Everything was fine
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.900]   So I just ended up making me more anxious than I needed to be anxious. Yeah, which is just
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:56.980]   My cue like this because you now you're traveling worldwide, right? And you use a ring on your
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:02.740]   Airbnbs. I have done and I probably will do in the future and it's been really very valuable
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:08.660]   I would I have this mounting putty that I just stick it wherever I'm living and so I did it in mexico
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:10.740]   I did it in marsa
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   places and and it's it's um
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:18.820]   The main reason is that when you're in an airbnb and you're living around people who just are they live there
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.380]   They know you're a traveler and everybody knows that you're a foreigner
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.180]   You probably have cameras and cash and all this passports and stuff
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:32.820]   And so it's nice to know before I walk in that nobody is inside. Yeah, and I can prove that to myself
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:35.380]   Right. I get the Wi-Fi and all that kind of stuff
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:38.340]   But the other the other thing is that you learn and and this is fun
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:43.060]   I recommend this is a hobby for everyone go to youtube and search for ring video doorbell videos
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:47.140]   Someone has a lot of crazy stuff happens. It's not as of hilarious strange things happen
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:53.940]   I told you mike about the one where it was a weird video. I wish I could find it the guy licked the doorbell that one
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:58.820]   I saw the one licking the doorbell that was really weird. Yeah, but then there was a nice older woman
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.580]   Who was arranging flowers on the person's doorstep?
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:05.620]   They shed a little vase she took some flowers put him in the vase
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:10.820]   Got him all arranged and picked it up and left. Okay, and the person was going. What the hell is this?
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.260]   Why is this woman coming to my doorstep to raise flowers?
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.540]   She posted it on the on the neighborhood app and her neighbor said oh
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.420]   That's the woman that's been stealing my flowers
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.740]   So she cuts the flowers next door gets away from there
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.340]   Um, arranges and puts them in the face that keeps them open
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.340]   Where is she going with this flower?
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:38.340]   Yeah, this kind of thing has always happened at night. Oh, who knew who knew now we know we we can track them
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:43.220]   I I was the person said I'll never have cameras. I don't I think that makes you paranoid. I don't want to have cameras
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.060]   I now have a ring doorbell
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:50.980]   Yeah, I have I just put another camera in on my house because lisa woke up last night the other night saying I heard somebody on our deck
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.300]   So I put a camera up there
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:59.700]   Why not? Why not? I get it if you if you have these threats and and have seen signs or whatever I get it
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.940]   But don't spread this suspicion
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.460]   What's a kylo a kylo Ren a hundred pound
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.300]   That works pretty well. Yeah, that'll do this
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:15.300]   I know seriousness. I get it when that people put those things up, but that whole neighborhood thing
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:20.500]   I can't really buy it at too much. I saw someone in a chat room believe it was chumly that was saying
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:24.500]   They wonder if those things are moderated, you know already
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:30.740]   They're not really and that's part of the problem right is is and I think it I think it can lead to a mob mentality
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.060]   Yes, you know I at home
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:39.860]   I'll take walks early in the morning or early or late at night and I yeah, I have on orange right now
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:46.580]   But most of the time I specifically put on orange or something bright when I go out to walk at night
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.700]   Just because of stuff like that that you're talking about, you know
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.660]   And if I go and do a photo walk at night, you're not gonna wear a hoodie
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:56.340]   I have I wear an orange hoodie. Yeah, you're not gonna wear a black hoodie
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:02.900]   I have I have colorful stuff in the trunk of my car. Does that help? It does because you know, especially if I go on a
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:07.380]   Like a landscape walk through a nature trail or something people are jogging
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.100]   Especially you don't want to surprise them right they see
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.460]   Big you're you're big dude. It would be a little scary
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:19.140]   Right, so they can see me in the distance and there's not going to be some type of excuse of I surprised them
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:22.020]   You know, I have to do it for them and I also do it for you
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.100]   No, I don't blame you. I'm sad that you have to do that
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.700]   Because white people don't have to do that. No, of course we got white faces
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:33.060]   I'm glad mike it is because if he did he would look like a hacker in the stock photo
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.300]   Oh, yeah, aren't they gonna change that one of these days? No, they're hackers that they're
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:43.780]   Burglar mask. I have a little complaint because we've hired two people both of them are over six foot
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:48.980]   Jason six foot eight. It's a problem. I'm now the shorty in this operation
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.980]   I'm under six foot shawty, but you still but you start calling me shawty. I'm gonna be mad
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:39:01.460]   But oh shawty. It's a party, but you still have the voice you are the voice the voice
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.860]   But I'm this squatty little short voice
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.660]   Oh my god
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.260]   Not a good look
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:11.700]   How about turkey this worries me a little bit here in the United States?
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.340]   I love turkey
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:20.100]   You got stuff in you got mashed potatoes. Uh, no the country of turkey
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:27.620]   Um in the United States the federal communications commission regulates broadcast and that's reasonable because you're using
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:34.020]   A resource that's owned by the country by all the people of the country the airwaves the spectrum and so they regulate that
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.540]   They do not regulate podcasts. We are not regulated by the FCC
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:44.020]   Fortunately and I well, you know, and we you don't we're not swearing up a storm. We're not using the eight dirty words. We're not not yet
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:49.060]   It's just joined us. It's new it could happen surprise
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:53.140]   John won't let you do that. But we're not the government has no say in what we do, right?
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:58.500]   Bloggers can say whatever they want and I think on the on the balance. That's free speech. That's appropriate
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:05.220]   Right. I understand why the FCC regulates broadcast spectrum. I understand why they don't regulate online and that's a good thing in turkey
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:09.460]   The radio and television watchdog, which is the rtuk
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:12.660]   Has now been given permission
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:18.260]   To have oversight over all online content including streaming platforms like netflix
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.820]   online news outlets
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:26.980]   Uh, this to me is exactly the thing and I can even see that happening in the us where people say no, no
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.740]   We've got to control. Yeah, we got to control terrorism
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:35.540]   It's because the turkish government is moving towards authoritarian and has to want it then for a while
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:37.780]   Yeah wants to be a dictator and
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:47.380]   Honest obviously wants to control anti- erdawan sediment and the internet is heavily censored in turkey already experience. Yeah. Yeah, the aim of this regulation
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:54.420]   Uh says the regulation is to establish the methods and principles to regulate the presentation and provision of radio television
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:58.520]   And on-demand broadcast services the handing of broadcast
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:03.940]   Licenses to media service providers the granting of broadcast authorities the platform administrators and the supervision
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:10.100]   Of the broadcasting question you have to get a license now to be a podcast to do what we're doing
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:18.660]   Wow in turkey. Wow. I mean this is um, this is part of a global trend where certain authoritarian rulers are looking to china and russia as models
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:22.180]   For how they can can uh, you know
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:30.740]   Succeed in politics by controlling the media controlling the dissidents all that stuff. So it's you remember when when there were coups
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.300]   In a country in the old days the first thing they do is take over the tv and radio station
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.300]   Right you control the media control the broadcast media that you control what people learn about
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:46.500]   The coup. Yeah, but now you've got the internet. It's a lot harder to control. Well the and and these guys are amateurs compared to china
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:53.220]   I mean china censors social media in real time you type we need to prove i know waybo and it's got it vanishes
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.620]   Henry and iran china 2009 10 years ago
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:58.180]   It was the weager revolt was happening
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:03.460]   Uh the muslim minority in china. We were watching cnn michael jackson. It just died
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.260]   We were watching the funeral. Mm-hmm all of a sudden it goes black
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.580]   Yep for three minutes and comes back
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:13.860]   Because they were doing a story on the weager revolt and they just snip it out in real time. Yep
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:17.940]   That was 10 years ago. Yeah, I went to ces asia
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:21.620]   Uh back in june and that's my first time in china
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:28.260]   My mind is a content where we're in china. Was it shanghai? Yeah shanghai. It's a wild city. It is
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:34.740]   Shanghai is pretty dad gum cool. Yeah pretty dad. Yeah, but as a content creator, I struggle because
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:40.100]   You can't get to face. Can't get my stuff out. You can't get yeah, you know, that's that's part of my gig
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.780]   I got to get my stuff out and people were people knew I was going
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.220]   You know as I got a scholarship to go. Thank you cta for that
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:53.780]   And that's cool and people were looking forward to the content and it took a while to get a way to like at home
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:58.660]   Right so I wrote a piece about this last week for uh computer world and idg
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:04.340]   Basically people talk about the splinter net and my contention is that the splinter net is a just a fact of life
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.900]   It's already here and china is the poster child for that
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:11.620]   I mean if you if you have a list of the top 20 services that people use on the internet
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:13.860]   None of us have heard of any of them. All right
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:20.260]   And if you take a top 20 list of our favorite places to go on the internet there those are all blocked in china
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.420]   It's a different internet the whole experience is completely different everything is different
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:27.460]   The splinter net is real and and I think that again
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:32.580]   There are lots of countries that are trying to emulate china russia's the most aggressive in emulating china
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.140]   But china is the gold standard in
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:41.540]   authoritarian and and and a I control of speech in real time and media etc
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:46.740]   And you know, it's it's problematic. We we we need a stronger counter effect in the
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:50.820]   Just for kicks and giggles. I was trying to connect to
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:56.900]   Whatever and I couldn't and so I said I'd call up customer service just to see what was going to happen
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:04.100]   You know and in china. Yeah, just just to see what was going to happen and I was using I believe former sponsor is express vpn
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:09.380]   They're still a sponsor and I was using that service and the representative just told me straight out
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:13.620]   Oh, you're using vpn. No, no. No, that's not allowed. Yeah, just like that
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:17.220]   They recently banned vpn's in russia as well, you know, just Russia really
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:22.820]   And hey, whatever. I don't want that. Yep. I don't want that internet. No
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.060]   Yeah
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:31.460]   Facebook this is the strangest move I've ever heard of exclusive from the information Alex Heath writing
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:36.900]   Facebook is going to change the name of the app instagram to
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:40.100]   Instagram from facebook
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:47.380]   And of what's app to what's app from facebook is that just another way of giving yourself a fancy LLC
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:54.900]   I don't know what it is. You know employees for the app according to he's were recently notified about the changes
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.940]   Which come as antitrust regulators are examining facebook's acquisition of both apps
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:02.580]   uh, and
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:06.420]   The move was met with surprise and confusion internally
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:14.260]   On the one hand you might maybe there's customer research that says the
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.580]   That we should do this
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:21.860]   And then you might just say this mark zuckerberg's ego saying well, no, no people think instagram's independent
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:25.540]   It's mine. It's one of the only ideas they've ever had that they didn't steal
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:33.140]   Doesn't all do that as well. Oh well amazon do that would all they they they played down more than than this implies
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.180]   They did they did join your audible account in your amazon account
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.060]   They did and yes is audible in amazon
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:43.700]   Yeah, but I think I think the larger scheme is they
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:49.060]   Eventually they want all of these services to be called facebook facebook period. That's what they're doing
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:51.700]   And this is an interim move
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:57.540]   The next step is take instagram off completely first thing they have to do is inform instagram users that facebook owns the company
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:03.780]   Which many don't know that you know they don't know that facebook owns instagram or what's app and so they need to introduce that idea
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:08.020]   And so that in the future they can just lump them all together. This is the big privacy thing that
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:13.860]   Right zuckerberg got so much credit for he's basically doing this big power play where he's going to become waybo
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:20.260]   Right. He's going to become this all one thing right and you do it in fact. It's the internet
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:25.540]   It's the alternative the internet. It's the other just like aol used to be the internet for some
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:29.060]   Some set of people it's going to be the internet for some group of people
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:35.380]   But I think this is going to be very unappealing to instagram users for starters. I think what's app less so but instagram didn't
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.540]   Yeah, those instagram influencers seems risky
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:43.220]   All the other things with the coconuts. I mean, this is not going to that like facebook's for grandpa the facebook
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:46.100]   But also I think the facebook brand is tarnished right now. Isn't it?
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:48.580]   Yeah, it's not a good time to say oh, yeah, we're part of that
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:54.340]   And that's why I was kind of wondering is it a way for facebook to say you think we're bad, but we we brought you instagram
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.020]   We have instagram
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:59.940]   You think we're bad, but we you know so instead of twitter saying now with more nazis
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.500]   It's just
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:06.420]   It's bad positioning. No, I think so I think so from that perspective
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:12.260]   But if facebook's trying to make itself seem better than maybe that's I agree that it's like an interim thing
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:16.180]   But it's not like it doesn't help instagram and it doesn't have help what's app to
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.020]   Have that latched on
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.140]   Remembered that the founders of both companies have left
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:27.540]   As mark has slowly asserted his power and the people who are still there from both companies are kind of apparently according to this article
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:32.340]   Upset yeah, yeah, they don't they don't want to be sucked into the Borg
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.460]   one of us
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.140]   one of us
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:42.740]   Uh, and I think you nailed it mike when you said that's the first stage and just getting rid of those separate brands entirely
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:46.260]   Which also maybe an incidental benefit makes it harder to break them up
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.500]   Right, right because there is some pressure from the federal government to say well
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:56.020]   Maybe we should investigate this and maybe they should be forced to divest yeah, well, but it's facebook now
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:00.660]   Yep, it's facebook now. What are you gonna do? I don't think regulators are that stupid
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:04.340]   Actually, I take that back
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:10.420]   I showed it a brought to you by last pass use last pass. Yes, I do use last pass
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:15.460]   I do use last pass. I have no idea what my pass is for out of four twit pep us recommend
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:20.180]   Yeah, I don't know my passwords are either. I know the main last pass pass. That's all you know
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:26.260]   I don't know squat one password your last pass password and it does the rest in fact it generates long strong
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:32.820]   Unique passwords for every time you sign it's the first thing I install on any new phone any new laptop any new computer
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.660]   it's
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:36.660]   Kind of the key to my whole life
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:42.580]   The number one most preferred password manager at home and work and they are now doing something really exciting
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:46.180]   They're they're kind of thinking about the future of authentication
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:50.180]   Right pass will look first of all passwords terrible idea. Nobody
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.140]   Crazy right part of the reason we have problems with passwords is because everybody has to remember a whole bunch
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:59.860]   You gotta make them easy to remember, but they're not secure. It's just crazy. They use the same one over and over
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:04.740]   Let's get rid of passwords. So last pass is now they're introducing this in their enterprise app
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:09.140]   You guys by the way because you're now twit employees you'll be using the
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:14.980]   Last pass enterprise and you'll see these new features before you see pretty seem in the
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:18.740]   Rest of the versions. I think it's really exciting. It's a new business lineup. Nice
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:21.140]   So one thing you're gonna do is single sign on
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:28.020]   So here's the challenge for our it department for administrators for the boss of any business is
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:35.060]   You want to make your stuff more secure. You're giving employees the keys to the kingdom the keys to the bank accounts the websites everything
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:39.860]   So you want to make it secure. You don't want them to put it on a post it note on the on the monitor
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:44.260]   But at the same time employees resist because it's less convenient to paint in the butt
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:50.020]   Sorry, wouldn't it be cool if you could make it more secure and more convenient and that's where single sign on is really
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:55.460]   cool last pass enterprise is going to include single sign on for 1200 plus
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:59.940]   Integrated apps, SAML integrated apps and more coming all the time
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:03.940]   Each with its own getting started guide. So it'll be very easy for your employees
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.620]   Single sign on means they don't even need a password anymore
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:14.260]   They they go to a site they log in or start the process it pops up on their phone. They say yes, that's me
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.060]   They're in that's more secure than a password
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:21.700]   They're also adding multi-factor authentication. We know two factors great
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:25.300]   MFA is even better because it not only leverages
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:31.540]   You know a second factor maybe an authenticator, but it actually leverages your biometrics like your face your fingerprint and
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:34.820]   Contextual factors your location your IP address
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:41.540]   So it can verify with a variety of signals that you really are who you say you are and again no
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:44.340]   Trouble to the user. It's convenient
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:51.620]   It's great for admins. They get a easy to manage dashboard that lets you know who's using what apps what logins there are
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:57.060]   It is this is kind of the holy grail which is both more secure and more convenient
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.140]   It's the new last pass enterprise and leo
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:05.860]   In case people are worried that this contextual information is going to become a barrier. It isn't I travel all over the world
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:07.060]   And it never
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.980]   Confronts me because it's like oh you're in a different country
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:12.020]   It knows it works and it doesn't give me a hard time about that
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.420]   Which I'm kind of surprised because I would expect
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.220]   There to be problems because I travel a lot more than than most people and that was pretty amazing
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.300]   See they learn what your patterns are right?
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:26.020]   They know that you're a traveler right if I did that then maybe it would give me an alert
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:32.340]   Yeah, you're in China really the other data point that's really interesting is I've had an account for a long time an individual account
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:35.300]   And my son Kevin got a family account invited us to it
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:39.780]   Nice switch over from individual to family very simple simple same thing to enterprise
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:44.260]   In fact, you guys all have personal accounts when you join the twit enterprise you can
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.540]   It's not a merge because it's still private
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:52.660]   It's your personal account but with one log and you get access to both the enterprise and the personal which makes it very easy
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:54.340]   It's really nice
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.580]   That's one of the reasons we use last pass enterprise at twit
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:52:00.100]   The other one is because we had an engineer who posted all the passwords on a website, but that's a story
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.260]   I don't want to I don't want to get into it this time. Maybe that's what your bitcoin password is
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:06.580]   Oh man
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:15.220]   Last pass bridging the gap between passwords and identity by making access and authentication simple and secure for both it
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:19.700]   And end users join the thousands of businesses who have signed up for last pass
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:24.820]   And are loving it and trusting it and we're one of them last pass.com/twit
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.500]   Please use it for your own safe self
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:34.340]   Last pass dot com slash twit and we thank last pass so much. They've been a great sponsor
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:39.140]   We're going to be going to boston in in october to do an authentication summit steven
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:43.140]   Give us some kind of come out. We're gonna have last business. So we're gonna have some security experts
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.420]   It's going to be open to the public stay tuned for information about that but the last pass
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:51.700]   Authentication summit because I think authentication is the key the fundamental
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:59.140]   Issue here, right? How do you prove you are who you say you are right and passwords are the worst possible way to do
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:05.220]   Right, we know that speaking of trust and authentication. I was able to meet miss windy nathor last year. She's great
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:11.060]   She came to charlotte see so of duo security. She's great. Yeah, I love wind. Yes. She's a wonderful person
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:14.740]   We had her at our capital one event in south by south west. Yeah
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:21.140]   Uh, these are a couple of little tidbits to wrap up the show with apparently
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:26.500]   Live streaming of funerals is a thing. Yeah, and I started with weddings
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.580]   Um not so much to say here except it doesn't sound very exciting. Well, it's a little slow
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:40.260]   I don't know if the signal is stuck or if that's oh, but he's moving
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:45.300]   Yeah, I want no kind of beautiful pipe organ music
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:50.900]   Uh, but so if I mean honestly, there's a lot of times you have a funeral you have a wake you can't get to it
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.980]   I there's a lot of wakes I've missed or funerals. I've missed because I'm stuck
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:59.460]   Yeah, it'd be nice to be able to just kind of visit online. I don't know. It just kind of like it feels kind of like
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:04.900]   Oh, yeah, I'm that one person who can be there. So will you please set up this whole live stream for me?
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:08.820]   So I can I don't know like look over the top of everybody. Yeah, I don't know what you're gonna see
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.380]   Apparently funeral homes. It's like a big thing
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:15.220]   Well, I guess if you know home takes care of it all then maybe that because I don't I would like
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:20.660]   I would rather just not be there at all than to put the family out to make sure that I could be there over live stream
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.860]   I would feel really bad about that. Could you just hold up your phone so I can see
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:28.820]   Me and just make sure you don't hit the button where they put like cat ears. Oh my god
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:34.900]   It really ruined a moment. Do you think that works? I kind of only one way to find out Leo
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.740]   It'd be pretty funny
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.220]   What would you like at your funeral? What would you like with the tongue that comes out with?
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:48.420]   The rainbow vomit is that just called
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:52.580]   Rainbow vomit
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:56.820]   You know, I mean that service cost 50. Really won't mind. That's a little more
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:00.260]   That's a little more
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:04.660]   Spotify subscriber base Wow 108 million paid users
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:10.580]   232 million monthly users we thought for a while apple was just gonna eat spotify's lunches
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:15.620]   They were coming on strong, but uh spotify kits is now twice as big as apple
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.860]   Music and deserves to be it's like so good. Mm-hmm. They are also
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:24.260]   They've apparently they're in their sixth round of label label negotiations
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:27.140]   They have to you know, this is where spotify's business model is tough
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:32.500]   They have to get the four big music labels to say okay, they've got two of the four already
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:37.060]   13 years has been going on. It's typically a long drawn out process according to spotify
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:40.420]   They paid the most to our right. I hope they do
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:42.260]   I think they pay the most
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:45.380]   I hope they do because that's one thing I want artists to get compensated
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:49.220]   I don't want to use a streaming service and feel like I'm ripping the artist off
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:56.180]   Uh, do you I bet you do? Uh occasionally buy a CD even though you don't need to just to support the artist
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:59.460]   I haven't bought a CD in a while. Well, all right
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.620]   We're digital then I will buy a digital one. You'll buy a dibs buy a song or an apple
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:06.580]   I will buy a digital. I will do that just as almost a donation
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:08.820]   Yeah, right. You don't need for my favorite artists. Absolutely
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:14.260]   Yeah, I did that in qba because the band actually didn't have digital versions online. They just had the CD. That was it
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:17.460]   Yeah, wow
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.460]   This is interesting. So um
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:22.820]   Pandora has the highest per play royalty rate
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:26.900]   Uh, youtube has the worst per stream payouts
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:31.300]   Uh, but napster is the king of streaming music payouts
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:33.540]   Really? What is that?
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:41.460]   Wow, uh and then title all sweet title, uh, is is uh, second I think in payouts
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:43.700]   I thought about title a couple of years ago
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:50.740]   Yeah, I still there. It's there. But when I installed Plex that was the music service. Yeah, partnership with them. Yeah
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:57.060]   And I've considered it because I'm I'm a google music subscriber. I'm like one of three people. No, I was
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:00.100]   Oh, so you use one too. Kevin has two. Okay. There's a three, right?
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:03.860]   But I don't ever kill it. You know what? You don't ever want to kill it. I killed it the other day
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.900]   I thought I got apple. I got amazon. I killed youtube
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.020]   All of a sudden I'm getting ads on my youtube. I went what?
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:15.380]   Man one time I forgot to change the like the expired card in my google music
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:17.940]   And all of my youtube videos
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.580]   And like what is this?
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:22.900]   I'm waff have to watch ads like an animal
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:25.780]   What is this a podcast?
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:31.380]   Music is in third place. I've considered Spotify because I hear how good this algorithm is but my problem
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:35.220]   So you guys are also an apple music spotify and apple just spotify for me
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:38.820]   I want to migrate my stuff from google, but I don't necessarily have a tool
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:44.820]   Spotify doesn't do the thing that google and apple do which allows you to upload your collection
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:48.660]   And make that part of the streaming service. I don't think there's a way to do that spot
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:54.980]   There's some obscure music there might be some services that some of them are kind of sketchy
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:58.100]   Yeah, no, no, no, I'll talk after the show
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.540]   um
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:03.540]   A new bill would ban
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:05.860]   autoplay videos
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:11.460]   And endless scrolling what what congress don't you have something better to do? He's always doing this though
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.860]   Oh, it's josh hauling snapchat. Uh snapchat. What are those things called young people
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:21.380]   Are you out there? No, no one's saying anything. All right. Yes. Yes streaks. Thank you
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:27.300]   These are what they so-called dark patterns josh haulie just discovered dark patterns basically
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:33.620]   Yeah, well, no he's been discovered he keeps making these stupid bills and no one pays any attention to because he wants to
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.700]   Make sure your neck of the woods. He's a mazurias. Don't remind me. Yeah. Wow
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:45.140]   When we we talked about this on tech news weekly and at that point the chat was saying that in mazuri they don't teach you science
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:51.380]   They uh, they I can't remember those three things and while the science part is true. They don't there
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:55.700]   Um, I mean they don't teach you science kidding. I'm kidding. That's just that was the joke
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:58.900]   Um not even california he can's like happily slamming
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:03.060]   No, no, I love mazuri. Uh, but this guy's not great. Uh, so yeah holly
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:08.340]   He's been wanting to just completely destroy social media for a while ever since he's gotten against his
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:13.860]   Aversion of dark patterns because they are really loathsome and I see them all over the place
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:16.180]   He but it should it be a bill
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.780]   The smart media addiction reduction technology act
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:26.580]   I mean social media addiction reduction technology act which is smart. Uh, I appreciate smartness of it
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:33.380]   But but at the same time it does sound a little asinine. You know every now and then we do need to put the social media away
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:41.140]   Can you can't deny that there is this kind of addiction model though, right and that they are playing on our kind of
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.620]   Unconscious
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.660]   Needs to get us to use but he wants to ban
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:52.580]   Facebook and twitter from being able to give you a stream of stuff and that's what those that's what they do
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:57.060]   Theory being you just sit there and look and look and look and you never stop and you only have a couple months
[01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:03.060]   To comply if this were to be gone. It's still is this a great news source. Yep. I'm filthy
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:07.540]   I like that adjective for that. It's a filthy dirty news source. You filthy
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:09.780]   That's how I want to rejoin. That sounds good
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:12.020]   It is a great news source because it happens
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:18.500]   Hey, twitter gets it before the news gets it, you know, absolutely have you ever used low cast
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:23.780]   Low cast.org negative watch broadcast tv for free
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:25.780]   You have to tell it where you are
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:31.620]   If you are in one of these cities boston, New York, philadelphia, baltimore, washington, houston dallas denver
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:38.740]   Chicago everywhere but clumps in south carolina weirdly soup falls in rapid city or san francisco
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:45.540]   You can watch local tv for free does it count even though like here even though it's not quite in san francisco
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:47.540]   Nice it says
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:50.500]   Donate we need your support, but they don't charge you
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.940]   Does this sound legal?
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:59.060]   I don't think it's just the free streams that I can I can there's an app for roku
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:01.540]   There's an app for apple tv apple tv is approved it
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:06.260]   So we don't have to install the little three inch antennas outside. I like that idea
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:12.100]   What company was they had all the antennas together in like a single place and they were getting in yeah
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:17.620]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was a it was crazy. It was like low cast it was
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:24.660]   Somebody in the chat room. Oh, well, so here's the deal. They're being sued by four major broadcast networks
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:32.740]   But did you know who funds low cast aerial area? You know funds low cast no AT&T
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:38.980]   Huh wait a minute. I mean aren't they just doing what I would do if I had an antenna outside my house
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:44.260]   Yeah, but you're not allowed to put it on here and let everybody watch that's exactly what they're doing
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:50.420]   This is so convenient and when I find I mean I understand an area and a lot of people try to do this
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:53.140]   and I mean the
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:56.100]   The problem is the all these broadcasters are
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:59.940]   Used to be free floating through the air. So what's the difference right?
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:06.020]   Um and they had ads right then they got money from the cable companies plus the ads
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.500]   And now they don't want to be free over the air. They want you to pay for them right now
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:14.660]   Right, um, so the networks are pissed. They like that extra beer money a month
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:19.300]   But AT&T is funding this baffles me. Let me ask what is their what do they do?
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:22.340]   Yeah, let me ask you a question. Why would anybody want to watch local tv?
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:25.140]   True. I'll tell you why
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.300]   football
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:30.100]   Again, I say why would anybody want to
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:36.260]   No, but nfl football lisa can't watch it on the internet, but she could watch it if she had an antenna
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:39.220]   Does not have an antenna here. But doesn't youtube offer her support?
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.820]   Pay for it $40 a month. Yeah, you pay for those services. I pay for
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:50.580]   Hulu's live version, you know, and I'm able to see my squad down and if I had an antenna in san francisco
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:55.300]   I could see all of this anyway. Can you say squad you're talking about congresspeople? Are you talking about my squad?
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:03:00.420]   Did you know people he's the fifth member of the squad? Oh man
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:03.540]   We need to talk mr. Elgin. Hey, thanks to
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:12.100]   Ajit pie. It's our Ajit pie alert. He's in the news again. Once again. He is the FCC has ordered cities and towns to
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:16.420]   Wait for it stop regulating cable broadband
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:23.860]   So the FCC effectively has said we're not going to regulate it none of our business, but you better not either
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:32.260]   Many cities and towns have written the FCC saying don't
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:38.500]   Um, one of the things that will happen is funding for local channels
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:40.820]   Which is often a requirement for the franchise
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:46.420]   Will be eliminated so those local public access stations say goodbye
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:49.460]   uh plus
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:53.780]   You know the FCC says well this we're gonna this
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:58.180]   Uh funding these local stations damages the ability
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:04.020]   Of the nation's broadband providers to extend their networks to communities without highs in other words
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:06.340]   Well, we're gonna do this so they'll extend it, but
[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:13.700]   Uh jessica rosen war saw who is one of the FCC commissioners who voted against it said if you go through the text of this decision
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:18.820]   You'll not find a single commitment made to providing more broadband service and remote communities
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.260]   There is no enforceable obligation to expand capacity
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:26.740]   There is no agreement that any savings from this action is pushed to the new network deployment
[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:30.580]   Basically, it's another give back to the big
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:35.700]   Broadband providers to Comcast to cost what Ajit pie is all about
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.460]   Mm-hmm
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.420]   There will i'm sure be a lawsuit, but I just wanted to bring your
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:45.860]   Your awareness this but here sadly any day now here is the most important money money money money
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:48.500]   And final story for the week
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:55.620]   Ninja is leaving twitch everyone gasp to stream exclusively on mixer. Hey, who's ninja? Oh?
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:05:01.700]   I knew we would make it to the show
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:10.020]   Even last two hours no no the reason you don't know ninja is because you wisely will not let Jacob and Isaiah play fortnight
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.260]   Wait a minute. Do you know what for you know?
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:19.060]   Kids see his mouth just dropped. He's not wait a minute. Yeah, what he is the superstar fortnight
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:25.300]   He is one of the great fortnight players. Don't tell them that a 16 year old won a three million dollar person a fortnight competition
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:29.380]   Don't tell them that either. Okay. Don't get your hopes up hard heads
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:34.340]   Parents used to be able to tell their kids you can't play video game. You'll never get a job
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:38.180]   Ninja
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:43.220]   I guess this is I don't know he's so use huge on twitch right he's one of the most popular stars on twitch
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:49.300]   This is a big deal if you're in this space right mixer is microsoft's streaming service
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:53.140]   Struggled a little bit especially compared to twitch or even youtube
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:54.820]   ninja
[02:05:54.820 --> 02:06:00.580]   Released a video. I've been holding on to this for quite some time. I'm just super excited to let everyone know
[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:05.620]   I'll be streaming on mixer full-time and now he's and I'm honestly at a loss for words
[02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:11.620]   I'm freaking out in the best ways. Let's all go have some coconut. He's he's the Howard Stern of gaming
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:15.460]   He's going to a place where he will dominate completely right
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:18.980]   And just super excited about how much money microsoft's probably paying
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:23.860]   Commas in that paycheck right Microsoft money
[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:26.660]   Yeah
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:32.100]   So ninja has has been on the cover of ESPN magazine. Why ninja has been featured

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:50.820]   Who's a DJ? Oh, so marshmallows also this marshmallow name. Yeah marshmallow plays fortnight
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:56.180]   Okay marshmallow is pretty good actually they won the team competition. I bet you're actually marshmallow
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:00.500]   No one knows who marshmallow is do they play for IOI?
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:04.580]   Because you're always talking about getting moonlighting is marshmallows
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.340]   Blumped or what is it that you say when you land from the bus and you get

[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:36.020]   And we're gonna we're gonna be in Europe for a couple months. Let's give a big plug
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:38.740]   to uh chatterbox
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.740]   chatterbox
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:44.580]   This is the diy smart speaker that anyone can program
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:51.460]   I'm I'm having some trouble right now kevin because I went to indigo go search for chatterbox
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:54.180]   And I got a band named chatterbox
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:59.300]   Hello chatterbox.com there it is
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:04.100]   Look at that see if you uh if you're worried about amazon's echo if your kids
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:08.820]   Uh are treating echo like a human being because they don't understand the technology
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:11.860]   If you want them to understand a little bit more and be a little more private
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:17.060]   Look at chatterbox first of all it's not listening unless you hit the big yellow button on the top
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:24.900]   Kids can build chatterbox can program chatterbox chatterbox has its own language even kids can use
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:27.940]   It's such a cool project
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:31.780]   That's what's what about adults can adults also make chatterboxes
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:38.260]   They can there's a huge number of people who when he did the kickstarter campaign just wanted to build it for themselves
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.820]   And it's a great idea. That's awesome. Yeah, that's so cute
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.780]   I uh, I think we should have a little craft stay at twit where we get a bunch of chatterboxes and we
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:47.460]   Reminds me a bemo from um
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:52.740]   Yeah, thank you from a vision time. Thank you. Oh, maybe that was the influence
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:59.780]   What's cool is like lots and lots of kids in silicon valley have tried this and they just absolutely love it and you can use it as a
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:01.780]   Chromebook
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.980]   So web-based programming interface that's really nice
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:12.660]   So support mike sine kevin and the chatterbox and do a favor to your kids teach them a little bit technology
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:16.180]   And how and how these things work. I think it's awesome
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:25.620]   chatterbox the diy assistant that you can teach hello chatterbox.com mike elgan gasteronomad.net if you want to get on the
