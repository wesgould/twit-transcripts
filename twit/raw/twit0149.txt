[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   Episode 149, June 30th, 2008.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.920]   Bill Gates. Not even.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Audible.com.

[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.880]   So we've got the panel here.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.440]   Bill McCrone, of course, longtime editor of PC Magazine.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   John C. Devorak, who is famous for so many things,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   including Devorak.org/blog, but also a long time
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.120]   columnist at PC Magazine, among others.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.120]   And Jerry Pournell, for years, wrote the Chaos Manor column,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.320]   the user column at Bite Magazine.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.960]   And it's appropriate to have a bunch of old timers today
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   because Friday was Bill Gates' last day at Microsoft,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.840]   or at least so they say, John's looking at the ceiling now.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.160]   Am I driving you crazy already?
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   You know, I'm telling you, this Bill Gates thing is a bunch of ERBS.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   He's not leaving. He's not going anywhere.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.080]   Well, you know, just to get right to it,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.520]   I have a column running in PCMag.com on Monday,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880]   which kind of expresses my feelings.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.320]   If he's still on the board of directors as the chairman,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.760]   this is not retiring.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.960]   Retiring is leaving the company.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.800]   Well, he's not going to be there for day to day.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   So what?
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.920]   OK, well, it's been a great show.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.720]   I thought we could do kind of so long, Bill.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.360]   We hardly knew you.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   We hardly knew him.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.920]   So great story.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   We probably knew him.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   Yesterday's.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.360]   Yesterday's.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.280]   He's faced constantly.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.160]   We knew him way too well.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.120]   Yes, we knew him all too well.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yes.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.360]   Yesterday's account, I've been doing a account
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   on a daily basis of how many articles,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.600]   or redundant articles about Bill Gates quitting.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.400]   And it's been running about 900 a day.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   Different.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.000]   And then we hit 1,100, hit 1,000 on Thursday,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.600]   and hit 1,100 on Friday.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.720]   And so I did the count yesterday on Saturday,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   and it was 1,600.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560]   Holy cow.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   But it's a great story.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400]   What's the story?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.280]   I'll tell you the story.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.840]   I'll set it up since you don't want to give me the time of day.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.000]   The story is--
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.520]   It's the last 311, by the way.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   The story is--
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   3, 11, there it is.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.720]   The story is-- here's a guy who--
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.600]   30-- what was it?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.320]   32 years ago, 33 years ago, was an undergraduate at Harvard.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.240]   He gets all excited about the Mitzel tier computer,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.760]   writes basic for it without even access to the machine.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   Paul L. Rode the machine.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.440]   Well, he and Paul L. Rode, whoever did it.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.400]   Without access to the machine, they write an emulator.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.080]   They write the basic.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.480]   They fly to Albuquerque.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   They pray it works.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   It does work.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.080]   They start a little business with just a handful of people,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.200]   very geeky-looking people.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.800]   If you look at those old pictures.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.680]   That eventually becomes one of the great success stories
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   of all time.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.760]   He creates an industry where none existed.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.600]   He created an industry about selling software.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.400]   There's plenty of it.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.560]   Now, you're taking the tack that Bill Gates invented the business.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.640]   I'm saying he--
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.800]   Even though his software ran on CPM,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.840]   and the whole business would have done just fine if it wasn't
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.720]   for-- if he existed or not.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.360]   Well, I guess my position is that he invented the notion
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.720]   that you could pay for software.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.880]   Don't you think before Bill Gates--
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.040]   He wasn't free.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   And worse than that, I don't know.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.120]   So the problem is I'm here with you now.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640]   So you have to actually deal with it.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.480]   I have to deal with you.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.880]   I could just ignore you otherwise.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.200]   The difference also is that during that era,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.600]   when the competitor was--
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   CPM was basically free.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.800]   You got it with the computer.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.760]   There was a license involved with CPM.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.320]   No, it wasn't free.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.800]   But you did have to write bile for it for most of the machines.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.280]   Yeah, no, that's the part.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   The real fix of it, now all that crap
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.520]   was not really until Windows came out in the '90s.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.480]   But let's go back to this--
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.640]   So what is Bill Gates?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.800]   What is his accomplishment?
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.160]   I don't think that he really has one.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.000]   I do.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.240]   OK, well, there you go.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.640]   Jerry Pournell, why should we credit Bill Gates with anything?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.480]   Unlike jobs, Gates really did have
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.720]   the vision of a computer in every house,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.000]   in on every desk, and in every classroom.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.560]   And he really meant it.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.440]   They had that written.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.160]   That was the mission statement for Microsoft.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.960]   It had written in concrete as you come up the path
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080]   at Microsoft and Redmond.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.400]   But people always leave out the last part,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.960]   a computer in every whatever office, home, desk, running
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.440]   Microsoft software.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.960]   Well, that's fine.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.760]   But the first part of it is the real vision.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.240]   And nobody else had it.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.600]   So the idea of ubiquitous computers--
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.320]   I have to give you-- I think that that's something you can
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.080]   give them credit for.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   Absolutely.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   IBM didn't have that vision.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.840]   But then what did they have?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.040]   IBM had a vision of 100,000 computers, all running IBM
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.080]   software.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.920]   Well, let me--
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.600]   Absolutely true.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.680]   Let me mention one more thing.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.000]   OK, I'll give him credit for that.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.440]   And that's probably a good observation.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.760]   Although, I'm not absolutely sure that he didn't lift that
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   from David Benel when Benel was at MIT or who knows what.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.360]   But let's say that he's got that done.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.080]   I think, to be honest about, I think
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.560]   his real genius, which was explored in an early interview
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.800]   done with him in PC Magazine.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.280]   And I don't know what's before or after
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.880]   as if Davis took it over.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.440]   But there was this long interview with Bill Gates, where
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   he talked about the fact that you could write bloated
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.480]   software--
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.960]   --seriously.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.560]   And he saw the fact that you could write this kind of
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.400]   bloated software.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   And the CPUs were going to improve so much on a yearly basis
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.760]   that it didn't make any difference.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.040]   And so you could really--
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   Well, he certainly lived that dream.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.520]   Yeah, and now actually the software's never gotten this.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.560]   I mean, it used to be more--
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.280]   you can't do bloated software jokes anymore,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.880]   because the CPUs and the hard disks--
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.800]   He was right.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   Yeah, no, he was dead on it.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.560]   But it was a weird concept.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.320]   And that was visionary.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.360]   So OK, correct me then.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.320]   So you're saying that he wasn't the first company
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.520]   to really make software be a viable business proposition.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.880]   I haven't say Gary was doing reasonably well
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.000]   with digital research.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.200]   It isn't as if that company were doomed.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   The problem is Gary didn't have the kind of ambition
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.080]   that Gates had.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   No one has the kind of ambition that Bill Gates had.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.040]   I understand, but Gary wouldn't have thought in terms
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.320]   of 100 million computers.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.160]   So it was really Bill Gates' grandiosity
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.840]   that made him unique.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.360]   I think it was focus.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.760]   Focus is another word for it.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.280]   Grand vision and focus, yes.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.520]   Is it the case that he really isn't a technologist?
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.000]   That his real skill set was in business, you think?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.920]   I think it became that.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.000]   But I think initially he was a coder.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.960]   I mean, that's what he always bragged about.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.280]   He was a hell of a programmer.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.200]   You did not want to go head to head with Gates
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.120]   in a programming contest.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.640]   Believe me.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.560]   Right, we sent our best guy.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.800]   We sent Charlie Petzold to compete with him and he lost.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.720]   Compete now.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.280]   How?
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.560]   Actually, it's a story I had in mind.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.240]   Tell me that story, Bill McCarry.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.400]   You were there, right?
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.360]   I think Jerry was there.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.120]   Well, you go on and it was your guy.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.960]   But yeah, nobody was better than Gates in those days.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.640]   Well, so what was-- so Jerry, what's the story?
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.760]   There was a competition?
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   There were plenty of them.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.760]   Bill would say, OK, come on.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.840]   I'm going to take you on.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   Who could be?
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   Who could be his match?
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   Who is the best programmer in the world?
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   What do you mean?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   We--
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   He would have coding contests and--
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   Talk about hubris.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.880]   What about what era is this?
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.840]   Is it at 84, 81?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   When is this?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   This is in the 286 to 386 era.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   83.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   OK.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   Yeah, it was later than 84.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   84.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   Let's see.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   85.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   I'll get it.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   Keep going.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   A little high.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   687.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   But in the late 80s--
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   I don't know if you're a hero, but I'm not sure.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   Yeah, they're--
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   Boy.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   In the 20s.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah, the 83.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.280]   So how would these-- Jerry, how would these competitions go?
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.200]   They would-- would you have a problem set that you had to solve?
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   How did this work?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   That was what I was at.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   Was it a problem set to solve?
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.800]   Use any language you want.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   What language did Gates use?
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   Trying to get him to run.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   What language?
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   Basic.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.560]   And Charlie Petzel did what?
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:10.640]   He actually wrote an assembler, which he set himself a really wicked task.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   But he decided--
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.560]   Could you bring your own macros or anything or you had to start from scratch?
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.880]   Well, you would bring your own programming library, but you had no idea what the problem
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.400]   was until you got it.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   Right.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.960]   Do you remember what the problem was in this particular competition?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.240]   Yeah, you had to draw circles of varying sizes on the screen.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.160]   So this is kind of-- I think this is something that people who know the Bill Gates of our
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.320]   era probably find a little hard to believe.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200]   So he was actually in their programming.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.360]   He was sit down at the computer and write the software.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   Yeah, but--
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   Yeah, but--
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.240]   Let's put it in perspective here.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.480]   Maybe a question of the moment is what was the last product that Bill Gates actually
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   wrote code for?
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.520]   Jerry, you probably know this.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.480]   I probably know I don't remember it.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.200]   OK, well, I'll jog your memory.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   And it was the TRS-80 Model 100.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   Oh, geez.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   OK.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.880]   Which was a 1983 machine.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.600]   The basic for that?
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.040]   No, he wrote part of the operating system, rewrote the basic for it, and did a couple
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.200]   of other adds and ends, wrote some of the I/O stuff.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.560]   Well, that's pretty impressive.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   Nothing to knock either.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.880]   That's one of the great computers of all time.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.440]   And Isaac Asimov used the damn thing till the day he died.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   You're kidding, really?
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   That's what he wrote on?
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   I'm not kidding.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   Wow.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   Great little machine.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   Isaac loved the trash-80.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.560]   But he wrote no other commercial code after that.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.960]   What he did was desk review.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   And that's when some of those infamous incidents happened to where he would climb up on the
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.520]   table and scream and throw printout around saying, "I could write better code in my sleep."
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.880]   And you know, he kicked aisles of printout over and yell at people and have tantra.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.600]   He had some credibility in that.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.360]   I mean, if this guy's a good programmer, you listen to him, right?
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.680]   Otherwise, you just laugh when he does something like that.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.760]   It might have been true.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.000]   He scared people in doing a better job.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well I remember, you know, that -- and I've talked about this book many times because it's
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   still one of my favorite books as a budding programmer, as a Microsoft book called Programmers
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   at Work.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.640]   And they have a chapter with Bill Gates on it.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.600]   And he proudly shows how tight and concise his early original basic code was.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.880]   And you could tell it took great pride in the fact that he wrote such tight code.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.760]   I mean, that was the thing he was most proud of.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.680]   Well, we all did then.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   You had to.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.160]   Well, let me bring up an anecdote then.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   All right.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.160]   All right.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.200]   In the book, Barbarians and Bill Gates.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   There's a book.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.920]   There's a Barbarians at the gate.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.720]   No, that's the one about Nabisco.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.320]   This is not -- Barbarians and Bill Gates, which is written by Pam Edstrom's daughter.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.280]   And one of the head guys at Microsoft -- Oh, nice givers, by the way.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.480]   Thank you for suggesting that.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   That's good.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.200]   And a guy who was -- I can't -- you guys might remember who it was, but it's one of the
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.800]   guys who went ahead of Windows projects.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.920]   And it's the story about Windows and how they changed the name because it was going
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.880]   to be something stupid.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.560]   And he tells the story that he was looking at some advanced code, supposedly.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.040]   And I guess it was in Windows.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.920]   And he looked at it and he says, "This is unbelievably bad.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.240]   This is the worst code I've ever read.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.400]   It's like amateurish and crummy."
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.520]   This is in the book, by the way.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.680]   And he says he turns around.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   It was Bill Gates.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   And he found out later it was Bill Gates who wrote that code.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   Somehow I knew that was coming.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.800]   You guys don't read the book, I guess.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.480]   It's a good book if you wanted a history of Windows.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.800]   So is Bill Gates the programmer that he seems to think he is or not?
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   That's the question.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   We've talked about this before.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   I remember John.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   I've talked about this for you for years.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   If you give me a second, I'll answer that.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   All right.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   I'll give you a second.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.880]   It depends on what you mean by how good a programmer.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:12.920]   What Gates did was exactly what John pointed out of that interview.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.800]   He understood Moore's law.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.840]   If you can make it run at all, ship it.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   Right.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.640]   Because the hardware will bail you out.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   Right.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.320]   IBM never understood that.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.240]   They kept trying to write tight code.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   IBM was going to make it perfect before they shipped it.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.040]   The result was what you see.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.200]   Now is that good programming?
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.520]   It certainly is good given the way the world works.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.080]   It's pragmatic.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.160]   But more than that, it was foreseeable good.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.280]   It was the right strategy.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.280]   I think that that's a reasonable.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   No, I think it was genius.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   Point of view.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   I mean, and Vesta is the last, the latest example of that.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Good enough.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:12.320]   Vesta on a quad, 6,600 or better, works just fine.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:20.360]   But I sure don't like it on a core two duo of an earlier era.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.240]   Steve Jobs, when they were designing the Macintosh is famous for saying, you know, great artists
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.960]   ship.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   If you don't get it out.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   Yeah, what good is it?
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.000]   It's like me and my book under depression.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   We'll see it someday.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.680]   I hope it happens before the depression because nobody's going to want it after the depression.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.400]   I'll be out in shortly.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   Is it?
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Shortly's when, like a month?
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   I get it.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   What am I doing sitting here?
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   When do you get the work?
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   The work.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.720]   God send me a review copy.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.000]   I'll send you some proofs.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Good.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Really?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's already improved?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.520]   When I get it improved, I'll send it some proofs.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.360]   I got to go through one other editor guy who's going to help me already.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.360]   I understood him.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360]   He spoke the words.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.120]   I've been speaking the lingo.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.360]   The lingo, the writer's lingo.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   Way back.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.400]   I live in writing books, you know.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.120]   So let's get to, let's address this.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.600]   Then there's no reason to say, to write the epitaph for Bill Gates.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.760]   He's still going to be just as much of a player at Microsoft.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.960]   He's just going to be.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.880]   Well, according to my column, running on Monday in PCMag.com.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.880]   Did you mention that yet?
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.000]   Because I think we should probably give that a little plug there.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.320]   I'm of the belief that we're going to hear more from Bill not less.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.000]   More publicly more.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Well, I believe you're right.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.760]   He's going to be more of a pest than he ever was when he actually had to work the day
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   to day.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.520]   I wish you were more of a, when I read that email that he sent out, we talked about this
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:50.760]   last week from 19, was it 19, a few years ago, bemoaning how hard it was to use Microsoft's
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   website and download updates.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.880]   I thought, gosh, that's right on.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.120]   I think we should hear more of that kind of Bill Gates.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   I hope he's beaten up on Microsoft like that.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   Could be.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   He's apparently not making any headway.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.480]   Well, he certainly hasn't sensed that memo.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.040]   Maybe that's the case.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.360]   I want to hear more from him, but not in computers.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.040]   I want him to change the world.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:21.120]   If he would put up a $10 billion prize for the first outfit to put 31 Americans on the
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.040]   moon and keep them there alive and well for three years in a day, he would be remembered
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.200]   when his abel of the greatest long for cut.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.160]   Well, maybe he's paying attention.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.960]   He might be listening to this bill.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.440]   Well, he's, you know, he's, he's going to, he's going to send, you know, spend 30 or
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.760]   40 billion dollars on philanthropy that took 10 billions of that on the, is that all it
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   would take?
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.120]   Jerry, it's all it would take me then do it as a prize.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   Like the X prize.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   Like the X prize.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   Right.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.080]   The first outfit that does it gets the money.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.480]   So how much is Google putting up for the, was it trip to Mars?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480]   What is it?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.080]   Google's X prize, the new X prize.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:10.560]   It's like a hundred million, but they put so many rules around it that nobody seems to
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.040]   want to compete for it.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.280]   I wonder if they can keep 35 people alive in Redmond.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.880]   No, that life support.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.240]   Oh, that's hard.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.640]   Microsoft is not.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Yeah, I mean, okay, it's a demanding place to work for, but it's, it's still, it's not
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   the tech prize that it once was, but it's still a place where you can, as a programmer,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.480]   contribute a lot and make stuff happen.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.720]   Have you ever heard the story of why the offices are all the same size?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   No, why?
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:53.160]   Gordon Ledwin took a tape measure to Chris Peters office and discovered Chris Peters
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:01.480]   had two more feet of room in his office and Ledwin with mad and Kate said that did it.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.200]   And from that point on, they were all identical.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   Huh, right.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Could be true.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   Right.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   I totally believe that.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.480]   That is true.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   I tried to do that at tech TV, but nobody would listen.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.720]   You wanted a bigger office or a bigger, bigger, I just wanted an office.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.760]   Good luck.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.080]   Any office would have, would have done.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.680]   So will Microsoft be a better place and more productive place and more successful company
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.080]   without bill at the helm?
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   No, why not?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.400]   I don't think bomber has vision.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.560]   I think bomber is a captive of the bottom line boys.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.280]   And I don't believe Gates ever was truly dedicated to just the bottom line.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   He wasn't the bean counter.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.760]   The bomber is.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   Yes.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.640]   Bill McCrone, you agree?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.840]   I don't see Steve as so much a bean counter.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.800]   I mean, Steve is, you know, I've been there, you know, at times when I, I guess I wasn't
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.040]   supposed to be and I snuck into the back of rooms and watched him haranguing the troops
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.800]   and firing up the salespeople and so forth.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.960]   He's good at that.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   He really is.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.360]   And we've certainly seen the monkey boy and some of the other videos.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.160]   But that's his job, right?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   That was his job.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   Yes.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.960]   And he remains really good at that stuff.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.720]   So, I give him a lot of credit where that goes.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.480]   And I've also been in situations.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.800]   And interestingly, they've all three that I can think of up the top of my head have
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:51.040]   involved Intel where there has been some kind of an impasse that I and others felt
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.760]   would hurt the industry between Intel and Microsoft.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:02.800]   And I got to at least mediate or officiate or bring people to the table in three instances.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.920]   One was the Lotus Intel memory spec, which became the Lotus Intel Microsoft spec.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:17.680]   The other one was that crazy fax modem spec that involved memory again.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   What was that called?
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.480]   We've got to be under on a blank on it.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:30.000]   And the third was benchmarking, the whole windstones thing, which was a huge behind the
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   scenes battle between Microsoft and Intel.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.080]   Each wanted control over the benchmark.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.480]   So much so that I made my own benchmarks.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.720]   That was in 286.3, D60.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.520]   Well, well, it's done.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.760]   It invented my own.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   Right.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   I remember that.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.440]   Was that wasn't the sieve benchmark?
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   No, that wasn't you.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:07.960]   No, the one I did was inverting matrices because you use it both floating point and integer arithmetic
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.640]   and uses a lot of it.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.920]   So yeah, that was a pretty cruel benchmark of their.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.400]   But the interesting point about Steve was that when push came to shove, it was Steve
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:28.440]   who came to the table and negotiated with the Intel guys and told me, like, okay, we're
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.920]   about to make the sausage bill.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   You can leave the room.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   Oh, interesting.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920]   So Bill would leave.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   Bill would actually leave.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   You want to build McRone to leave?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   Oh, Bill McRone.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   No, no, no, Bill McRone had to leave because, you know, they had a tutorial.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   It was just together.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   Right.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.280]   And make them see each other's viewpoints and why it was good or bad for the industry.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.080]   And then get out of there.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.240]   Gates never was involved with that stuff.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.200]   It was always Steve who would, you know, be butting heads for months and then finally
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.480]   see the light, I guess.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.600]   I always thought of Bill as being a tough negotiator, though.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   Was Bill not a good negotiator?
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.040]   I never negotiated with him.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.280]   It seems to me like, I don't know, the deal that he made for DOS, for instance, that was
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   a good deal.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   But who made that deal?
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.880]   We have to talk to Patterson to figure out what really happened there.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.560]   I mean, I know it was kind of a scam of a deal.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   But you know, maybe what McRone is saying here is that the two of them may have been
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.480]   better partnered up that way because...
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.800]   Like letting them accard with...
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.840]   Because without Gates, I just, you know, bombers a guy I liked Steve, but I don't even,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.560]   I can't even imagine him sitting at a computer.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.760]   No, he doesn't seem like a tech guy at all.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   He's a salesman.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.440]   Yeah, he's like a sales guy.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   Look at good these...
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.160]   The guy you want to motivate the sales force, I've known a million of them.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.640]   He's the guy, the general sales manager at every radio station I've ever worked at.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   That's who he is.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   Now, I understand.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.000]   I never said he was a bean counter.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.400]   I said he is more likely to be influenced by them.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.480]   I don't think he has the kinds of vision.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480]   Gates is a...
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.720]   Gates is a guy that once he focuses on a vision.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.120]   It takes sledgehammer to get him off it.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.320]   Well John, you want to weigh in on this?
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.600]   I mean, you've been one of the people who said that the Microsoft, he's going to be
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.800]   a better company without Bill Gates.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   You still...
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   I did?
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Didn't you?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Am I wrong?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.480]   Since I did, it was a passing thought.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.760]   It was a passing fancy.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.480]   So, well, I may be misquoting it.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   I don't want to misquoting it.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.360]   Well, I think it's going to be a different company.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   In fact, I...
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.000]   In my market watch column, which ran last week in marketwatch.com.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.200]   Is that the...
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   That's a different one though.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.360]   I'm sorry you get one per.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   Maybe two.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.800]   Well, I thought it was one an hour.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   Okay.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   So anyway...
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   I got the clock.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   I got the clock.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   I'm too red to read.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   Plug all you want.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.680]   So anyway, I thought that Microsoft would tend to be fallen to the role of kind of a
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.080]   Honeywell or a Euniceus without Gates depressing.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   That's depressing.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   That's a big...
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   They're big money.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   They're just not interesting.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   Euniceus.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.560]   Are they still around?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.960]   They make banking systems.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   Honeywell?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Honeywell?
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   Are they still around?
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   I have a fan that is...
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   (laughter)
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   You're a Euniceus.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.360]   Euniceus is not only around.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:29.160]   They have a very nice conference house over in the south of France near Marseille.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.760]   They took me over there a couple of years ago to spend two weeks lecturing to their
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.320]   senior visionaries and things.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.360]   Do they have fine pete in Yarlsberg and a Gewertzterminer?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.560]   I mean, I don't know if there is...
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   Oh, they have!
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   Believe me!
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   They're a friend.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.680]   I can't answer this in good wine and cheese in France.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.120]   There must be something there.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.760]   You have not been to a better luxury hotel than the Euniceus conference house.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.280]   I'll keep that in mind the next time I get an invitation from it.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.080]   I'm going to work it out.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.360]   My wife keeps bashing on me to take her back there sometimes.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.720]   Maybe it'd be more apt to say Microsoft would be kind of like an IBM.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.320]   I think IBM is becoming like Euniceus and Honeywell.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   They're all the same.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.680]   They're all the same.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   Vermont Junction or whatever it is.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.520]   They're last microprocessor development area and FAB.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.600]   I think it's over.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.720]   They're still doing a lot of basic research and there's darn few companies who are anymore.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.560]   They sold Almond in research to Hitachi.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.200]   I just think it's a downhill slide.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.040]   Is there a natural lifecycle in tech companies?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.840]   I mean, is Microsoft not in the downhill slope?
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.520]   It happens pretty fast, doesn't it?
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   It does happen.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   They're 30 years old.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   That's a long time in tech.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.200]   One thing is Microsoft seems to have lost its soul in the last few years.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.880]   Well, isn't Bill Gates Microsoft's soul?
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   Who better?
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.440]   He somehow wasn't.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   He lost interest.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.960]   He got married, had kids, found philanthropy.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   He lost interest.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.240]   That's a piece of it.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.040]   But they used to be a cold house.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.840]   They used to make money selling code.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   That was the original money.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   They don't do that anymore.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.440]   Yeah, they don't do that anymore.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.560]   That's the old Bill Gates speech that I always was so fond of.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.440]   He used to give this great speech about what they did, which was making sell code.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   Yes.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.600]   So I want to hear some stories.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.280]   I brought you old timers on for a reason.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.920]   I want to hear some stories about them.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   Thank you, Jerry.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   I want to hear some stories.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.120]   We're going to have to edit your coughing out.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   No, no.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.560]   I need to get a cough button on this damn Microsoft phone.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   I push the button and it flashes red from you.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   It means us.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   Not you.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   That's the problem.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   Yeah, I'm afraid.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   That's all right.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   I think it's great.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.480]   As soon as I say all timers, yeah, there we go.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   No, but the reason I got you guys on is I wanted to have people who go back to the beginning
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.400]   with Bill Gates who have some stories to tell me.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.440]   John, you used to make, you used to go speeches with a video of the Bill Gates.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.840]   You'd take his speech and you'd edit it all down and you used a video toaster, which
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.680]   is a precursor to this tricaster.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.800]   Actually, the one video I made was I caught one of his keynotes at CES and he swallows
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.240]   a lot while he's talking.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.560]   He kind of swallows and--
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.160]   I think they trained that out of him later.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.640]   It makes a little gulping thing.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.480]   I edited together so there's nothing but that and it went five minutes.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   It's a good video.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.760]   That's five minutes out of 45 was just gulping.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.800]   He's never been-- but that's part of his charm.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.560]   He's never been a great front man.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   He's a geek.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:12.280]   Well, you know, when he was one of the memorable speeches he gave once when he was pushing
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:18.520]   the CD-ROM business, information at your fingertips was his keyword, which I was told
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.560]   was stolen from-- what's the name of Gibson, Bill?
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   William Gibson?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:34.280]   He was the name of the Bill, the guy who was one of-- he was there was like Gates' jobs
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.440]   and then the guy who ran personal software.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.440]   Gibbons.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   Fred Gibbons.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   Fred Gibbons, I'm sorry.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.440]   But, yeah.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   Fred Gibbons.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   He was the guy who thought up information at your fingertips.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.680]   Fred Gibbons came up to me one day about a few years after that term was going around.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.720]   I mean, he says-- and this was after he had his stroke which is really a-- I feel bad
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.040]   about Fred having that stroke because he was one of the main players in the industry.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.000]   He comes up to me and says, "John, you got it.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.320]   He says this is bull.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.680]   This information at your fingertips, I'm the one who gave Bill the term."
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.760]   And he had this long anecdote about when he told Bill.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   Oh, man.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.680]   And he just thought he was ripped off.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.360]   And I wrote it up in a PC magazine inside track, but you know nobody cares.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.400]   And it may even be true, but that is the whole point, isn't it?
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:31.160]   Gates was the guy who saw that CD-ROMs would change the world.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.920]   And he put on that big conference.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.240]   They only changed the world for a year and a half, by the way.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.920]   It was kind of a brief fling.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.520]   Well, because something else did.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:49.180]   But the point was that the readers went from the thousands of dollars down to under a
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.400]   hundred in a very short period of time, and it really did change the world.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.120]   Everything after that was incremental improvement.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:05.320]   Now once again, Gates had that vision.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.920]   And he had the pulpit from which--
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.600]   He had the pulpit and the position and the power.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:18.200]   Well, that first conference, you may remember that Phillips had its own plan for marketing
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.280]   CD-ROM through record companies.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:28.680]   And Phillips came to his conference and reigned on his picnic.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.920]   And that was when Microsoft was a, what, a $12 billion company, and Phillips was a $40
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.640]   billion company, and they basically threatened him with rolling.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.000]   Gates just went right ahead.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.960]   I think that's another thing that we probably don't remember very well, at least those of
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.000]   us who remember Bill Gates in the last few years, is Microsoft wasn't the dominant power
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   until the last 10 years that it is today.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.760]   Well, Lotus was kicking their ass early on.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.520]   When did it turn for Microsoft?
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.240]   Was it with Windows 95?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   When did Microsoft--
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   Windows 95 closed the door on everybody.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.880]   But the real disappointment was the Lotus people were brain dead.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.480]   And there's this theory that goes around the industry.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.040]   People bring it up and both Jerry and Bill have heard it.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.120]   And Sun brings it up occasionally.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:26.440]   And pundits bring it up, which is that, yeah, it refers to Sun, actually.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.640]   If Sun-- if Sun, microsystems, had Bill Gates as the CEO, they'd be kicking Microsoft's
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   butt.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640]   It's just the guy.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:40.200]   Because, again, like Jerry says, he's focused and he has a vision and he sticks to it.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.520]   I think with the CD-ROM thing, he stuck to it too long, which is why they missed the
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.840]   internet.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.760]   But Apple missed the internet, too, in a much bigger way.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:57.280]   Well, you make a good point about the guy at the helm and being over-focused because Scott
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:04.520]   McNally and Bill Joy could only think in terms of many computers and distributed computing.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:11.040]   And just like Deck, you know, Ken Olson could only think in terms of deck computers.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:17.120]   But Bill has been extraordinarily facile in moving from technology to technology as long
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.080]   as Microsoft had a finger in the pie.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:29.160]   Well, I do remember why Gates went so agitated back in that period when Microsoft was not
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.520]   so dominant.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.960]   The internet computer was going to put him out of business, remember?
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   They bragged it.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   That'd be a--
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   May still, by the way, put him out of business.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   It just took longer than he brought.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.840]   It took a long, long, just thought.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:50.080]   Meanwhile, he had this running fight with IBM over OS2.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.320]   John, you were there.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   He had that big conference.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.720]   John was a huge OS2 fan.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.080]   I remember that very well.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:04.360]   Well, but Gates had that big conference where we met over in Bellevue and took buses out
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   to the new campus where he had a new building set up for press events.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:18.960]   He was putting on the big show OS2 and it was a conference with a guide for the future.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:25.160]   And it was all going to be OS2 that was the vision of the future.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.880]   Gates gave his talk at like 8.30 in the morning.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.560]   9 o'clock, the IBM guy got up and said, "I think that's wonderful.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.040]   Now I got to go back to Florida."
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.080]   And literally left.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.600]   Well, I was at Bill's table at lunch.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.480]   He had six glasses of wine.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.960]   Oh, man.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:54.000]   You could see the steam coming out of his ear because he had just been dead in front
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.840]   of the entire technology press and financial analyst community.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.360]   And what was supposed to have been his big show.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.080]   It was another declaration of war.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.680]   Was that when the relations between IBM and Microsoft really took a dive?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   Obviously.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:21.120]   Bill introduced the IBM guy as a friend.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:29.480]   And all of their charts showed Microsoft as this little piece doing presentation manager.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.560]   But OS2 was the new coming operating system.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   And this guy, well, he defecated on him from a great height.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.960]   He allowed it to reach terminal velocity.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.560]   And then walked out of the room.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.080]   I was sitting with Esther at the time.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.200]   I looked over and said, "Yeah."
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.000]   And he said, "Esther, this means war, doesn't it?"
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.600]   And she said, "You better believe it."
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Wow.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   Wow.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.360]   Very volatile time because IBM wanted to reassert.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.800]   I mean, it has lost hardware control of the PC market.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:14.160]   But when you started at 100% of the market, the only way it goes down.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.240]   And they thought that OS2 would be their ticket to reasserting their control over the
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   market.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.040]   Well, that and microchannel.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.480]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.160]   Microchannel was supposedly a hardware solution, but they forgot a few things along the way
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   like...
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   Compatible.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   Like trying to collect back license fees.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.760]   Well, it's a stupidest business.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.800]   Stupidest business the station ever made.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.880]   You want a licensed microchannel?
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   Fine.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.280]   Pay us for the original P.I.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.080]   But, you know, P.S. but.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   Sure.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.440]   So good luck.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   I thought...
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   I don't maybe...
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.760]   Well, wait, wait, before we finish that little thought on this transition period.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.480]   I remember what a bunch of boneheads IBM were at the time.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.360]   And the fact when they brought up the P.S.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.560]   3, they switched prematurely to the 3...
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.000]   A lot of people don't remember what a big deal this was.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.400]   But they prematurely switched to a 3.5-inch disk drive with really no 5.25-inch option
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.240]   except a drive you could buy as an add on that was the size of a truck.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   You look like an aircraft carrier, right?
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:27.680]   And I would say 99% of the software at the time was being distributed on 5.25-inch disks.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   So it wouldn't work.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   It was ridiculous.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.120]   And wait, wait, there's one more thing.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.760]   They also brought out the P.S. 2 line and Bill, you'll remember this because we wrote
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.560]   about it extensively with a series of monitors that were flat out fuzzy.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.360]   Yeah, they were poor monitors.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:51.240]   The 75-14, I still remember ragging on it.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:37:00.480]   You said a key word about Bill earlier, and pragmatic was the word you used.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:06.280]   And I can give you a good example of Bill at his most pragmatic.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:13.640]   And that was when the Lotus Intel memory spec was being developed.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:20.920]   And if you recall, Lotus needed more than the P.C.'s maximum memory in order to do its
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.920]   job.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:30.400]   So they invented this Wacko bank-switched memory scheme and kept it a deep dark secret.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.520]   And through a lot of digging and digging, we finally figured out what it was.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.400]   But we weren't sure how it was going to work.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.760]   So they did a P.C. magazine technology day up at Microsoft's campus.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.920]   And every team that we went to, I closed the interview by asking, "So how does this work
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.640]   with the new memory spec?"
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.680]   And the P.R. guy who, Marty Tucker, who was following us around, had no idea why I was
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.360]   asking this question.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.080]   And sometimes I get a real technical answer, and sometimes I just get a, you know, like
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.600]   a, "What planet are you from?"
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   "Look."
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.160]   And so by the end of the day, our last meeting was with Bill.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.200]   And it was comical because it was pure Bill.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.160]   We were sitting in this conference room and it was a long narrow room.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.800]   And there was a whiteboard down at one end.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.680]   And we were all seated at the other end.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.720]   And every time Bill wanted to make a point, he'd run down to the whiteboard right on it
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.080]   and then run back rather than, you know, but that was his manic energy.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   Yeah, part of the half-time.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   Yep.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   Yep.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.080]   Yep.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   Yep.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   Yep.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   Yep.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   Yep.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   You've all seen it.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   Well, that's fun.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   I mean, that's actually kind of cool.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   We would do that.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   We'd do that.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   We'd do that.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   We'd do that.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   Yeah.

[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Who is selling airlter basic on paper tapes.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   That meetings were two nights.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   And he's selling them for $20.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   And he's talking them out of a bag.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   He's got up them.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   And the next day everybody else is selling copies for five bucks.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   Oh, he was pissed about that.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   Oh, he almost went out of his mind.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   I think that was the night on which he really got this bug about piracy.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.080]   That's quite a famous.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.080]   It was it was it.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   He went to the homebrew computer.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   I was going to say homebrew was where he's famous for that speech about.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   He came out.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   He was stealing my pipe.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   He might tape stop stealing my tapes.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   But this was about a week earlier than that made it.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   He had come.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   He was making all the the computer society meetings.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:40.080]   And SCCS in those days was bigger than homebrew.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   Says you.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   Well, okay.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   Says I'm says I'm Los Angelino.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   Bill is famous for being kind of an auto-didact they talk about in one of these books.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   I'm a vacationing with a girlfriend at the time Ann Windblad of Hummer Windblad.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   And bringing with him big books about biotech.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:14.080]   The red books of lectures of Shirley you just Mr. Feynman.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   Right.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   And just really love to learn stuff more than I guess more.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   You never got his you never got his degree.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   So he never relaxed.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   I mean, it's like I don't read anything.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   Yeah, you got your degree.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   You got nothing to prove.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   I don't need to.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080]   You can relax.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   That's somebody people tell me stuff.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   Just listen.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   I don't need to learn.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:37.080]   People tell me if I didn't know it, I'm sure somebody would tell me it.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   It's a fact.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:47.080]   Well, you know, I read a lot and I've got couple of talk rits and I'm supposed to know something
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   about a lot of things.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   I don't believe I ever stuck up a conversation with Gates in which he didn't know.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   Maybe not as much as I did about the subject, but he was certainly up there with what I
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.080]   would have said would have been my best student.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   He was a smart guy.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   There's no doubt about that, right?
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   He reads a lot.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   He remembers a lot.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   And he organizes what he knows pretty well.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   Some say he had a photographic memory.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   Would you say that's the case or no?
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   I have no idea.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   I don't think so.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   I don't think so.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.080]   I don't think it's voracious.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   Voracious.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.080]   Anybody that knows?
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.720]   Leo, it would depend on when I had an idactic memory until I was about 21.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.720]   It's all downhill after that, isn't it, Jerry?
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   One reason I got interested in diabetics for a while, I thought I could get my idactic
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.720]   memory back.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   Oh, really?
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   Were you a Scientology?
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.920]   No, Scientology didn't exist in 1950.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.320]   Well you were probably friends with Ron though, right?
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   I mean you must have known.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:01.040]   I never met Ron, but I read his book in the course, Mr. Heinlein, who was one of Ron's
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.840]   friends with a good friend of mine.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   Right.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.720]   But no, I thought maybe it would work.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.520]   I could get my photographic memory back, but in fact you could not.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.720]   It didn't work for me at least.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.240]   Oh, maybe I could get one in the first place.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.240]   That would be nice.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   Why?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240]   I don't know that I'd remember stuff.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.080]   Yeah, you can just do something to brag about.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   It's useless.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   No, you have the internet now.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.080]   You don't need it.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   You know, Google is...
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.080]   Yeah, Google.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.080]   I got what they call Google Assistant Memory.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.080]   It's so much better.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.080]   That's an institute observation.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:37.640]   Google pretty well does substitute for an idactic memory so long as you can remember
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.600]   enough of a phrase to have a unique animal.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.080]   I'll tell you during the radio show, frequently I'll pull up...
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:48.200]   I'll pull up what I need to know from Google fast enough that it sounds like I'm actually
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   remembering something.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   It's unbelievable.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.200]   You've heard me do it.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Yeah, so let's bring up one more issue here, which is that what do you guys think about
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.560]   the commentary by Steve that Microsoft is going to generate more than half of its income
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:10.280]   in the future based on advertising revenues?
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.080]   That's a pleasant fiction.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.800]   Wait, that's a long thing.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.040]   That's where they're going though, right?
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.360]   That's where they want to go is online.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.200]   Mesh advertising?
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:26.600]   You know, the market economy isn't big enough to support that.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.400]   And I'm just saying that off the top of my head, but I'm sure I could Google up something
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.560]   that would prove it, but I just don't think it's possible.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.760]   And not only that, what would be the point?
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:44.040]   I said one of my columns that Microsoft dodged a bullet when the Yahoo deal fell through.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   It was the best time that could ever happen to them.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.240]   I've said the same thing from the first day I heard that rumor.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:01:04.720]   So if look, the problem is within three years, we're going to have 64 core CPUs, 64 core.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   Within how long?
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720]   Three years?
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   Four?
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   Wow.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   Three or four?
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.000]   Are you one of those people that leaves a singularity is near the Rakers while singular?
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.720]   I've had that argument with Ray and no, I don't.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:25.240]   But the point is we're going to have computers that have what amounts to infinite computing
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:31.000]   power, infinite memory, and infinite mass storage.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.720]   And we have got software that can't strain what we have now.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.440]   The people that are going to make money are the ones who are going to figure out how a
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:49.520]   guy who knows how to do something useful and doesn't care about computer science can
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   sit down and teach the damn machine to do something useful without having to spend four
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.400]   years learning to program.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   Never happen.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   Give it.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.280]   Give it all that computing power.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.960]   I think it will happen.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   Never happened, Jay.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.880]   You're living in a dream world.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:15.400]   We've talked about this before, though, the notion that Texas Instruments essentially gave
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.840]   up on natural language programming.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.080]   They worked at it for a while and they did some fairly impressive stuff.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.480]   But the hardware limits were just too good.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]   No good.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.640]   They couldn't do it.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.120]   You're saying that they're going to catch up.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.840]   Hardware is going to catch up now.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.480]   Well the hardware has gone way ahead.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.960]   All I'm saying is that the people who can write software to make use of this bloody hardware
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.480]   are the ones that are going to get rich.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.080]   The heck with advertising?
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.480]   The advertising is going to get rich.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.920]   How long before computers start writing their own software?
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.400]   Why do humans even write software?
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.520]   Computer-assisted programming was a big deal during the 80s.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520]   It went away.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.440]   I never hear of it anymore.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.720]   Yeah, because it never worked.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.160]   I think it didn't work.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.920]   But again, the hardware couldn't support it.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Just that.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.880]   You know, Jerry, not to be argumentative.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   But why not?
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.440]   But I remember the first time I saw voice recognition stuff from IBM and they kept it.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440]   This promises-
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   It'll work eventually, John.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440]   It'll work eventually.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   It'll work eventually.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.880]   Let me just say the one thing that I've subscribed to and I picked this up very early
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:34.160]   on in the late 1970s from Lee Feldstein of all people who was the original architect
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   of the-
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.280]   And the Homebroke Computer Club early member.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.200]   He made this interesting comment that I've always thought was interesting.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.000]   You made it interesting comment that I always thought was probably salient.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   Yes.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Thank you.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I thought I'd throw in a word there.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   I needed one.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Anyway, Lee says, you know, it's just like with horses.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   It is.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   He says with horses.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Horse is you hat.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   There are words that you could tell a horse to do like and he had like-
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.280]   You can lead a horse to culture but you can't make it say-
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   You can set you-
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.680]   Horses do not understand plain English dogs don't either.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   No.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   And the fact that-
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.720]   But they do understand certain kinds of commands when they're set in a certain harsh way.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.960]   So we've adapted to the animal so they would understand this is the best we can.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.360]   And he always felt that you have to adapt to the limitations of the machine which will
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.200]   always be there.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.560]   And in other words, you have to talk to the machine in a way the machine can understand
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.920]   you and to expect more than that is crazy.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   I don't disagree but I think you can I think you can expect the machines to understand
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   more.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   Look.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   You know, I think that's the same.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:45.640]   It was always easier to write a program that would run properly in Pascal than it was
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   in assembly language.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.680]   Again with the Pascal, Jerry's never going to let go this Pascal thing.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:59.600]   I don't let go of strongly typed languages that are logically consistent and which find
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:06.240]   your mistakes in the compiler rather than you're having to debug the damn thing after
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.600]   you get it compiled.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   But I think that in a way-
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:18.920]   The reason that Pascal and modular and the other verb type languages didn't catch on
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.760]   is because they were slow.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.120]   They were slow to compile and their runtime package went slow.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.960]   We no longer have to worry about slow.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.440]   I can't write a slow program for a quad 6600.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:44.880]   Yeah, that's an excellent point because the language that we, you know, if any of us goes
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.560]   to our screen right now, we're executing XML, we're executing JavaScript, we're executing
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560]   Java.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.560]   Very slow languages but still we have our first power.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.440]   Bell, Bell, Longhand, you know, and once was the time we worried about, you know, tight
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.880]   home pages, you know, like let's only send them like nine or 11 or 16K of home page.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.640]   Now, you know, any page you land on is half a megabyte, you know, and it's doing all kinds
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   of stuff.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.560]   Now, Jeff Hawkins would say that it isn't the issue of speed, it's the issue of how they
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:24.080]   think and that they can't ever really, computers just don't work the same way that the von Neumann
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.560]   machine is just the wrong metaphor for thinking.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.400]   Well, that's what they're trying to do in a mentoring.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400]   They always say that.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   They can't get anywhere.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.520]   Well, the mentors try to create a new kind of chip that thinks more like the human brain
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   does.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:42.040]   And McCarthy was fond of saying the problem with big, massively parallel systems is that
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.160]   they are immune to programming.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   Well, that might be another issue.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160]   That's cute.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   I like that.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   That's a funny line.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   Another issue in some way.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   I got it.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   I think we all did, John.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.600]   You really don't need to glory in that.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.200]   I think that was pretty obvious.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   Oh, sorry.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.800]   But coming back to our friend, Bill Gates.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   Oh, him.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:05.280]   He would be the first guy to jump on it if somebody had a breakthrough or he'd be the
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.720]   second person to know about it and he'd be all over it.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.160]   Well, he's only 52.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.400]   I mean, he's not down and out.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.200]   That's what gets us back to the original point.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.040]   He's not really retired.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.720]   This entire episode that we've been witnessing is nothing more than a grand publicity stunt.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.840]   And we're going to see more of Bill than ever.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.240]   And I'm actually already sick of it.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.960]   You might be right.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.360]   But you put that far stronger than I would.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.400]   I think he's buying himself more free time.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   A little space.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.280]   But as chairman of the board, he can always come back.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:45.640]   Well, I would hope I would like to see him maybe focus a little bit more on these bigger
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   issues.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   Me too.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.160]   And he doesn't need to prove anything.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.000]   He doesn't need to show himself the man times man of the year anymore.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.640]   Maybe with a little free time, he can put that brain to some.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.720]   I don't know if he's gone for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   Yeah, he might get it.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   That's the thing.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.840]   He's the money.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.800]   He needs the money.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   What is it?
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   A million dollars now?
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   A Corona.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.080]   Well, actually the Nobel Peace Prize, I think, is given away in Norway.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.960]   And the Nobel Prizes are given away in Sweden.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.760]   Well, there you go.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   That's correct.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.520]   So you don't get to meet King and give away the peace prize.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.520]   Yes.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   Why?
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   How does that happen?
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520]   I don't know.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.560]   Norway and Sweden were the same kingdom when Nobel died.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:35.800]   And when they split apart, that was part of the provisions for dividing into two kingdoms.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.800]   You get the peace prize.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   We'll get the rest.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   Wow.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.400]   That's a really good fact to it.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.960]   Jerry, you're so full of that stuff.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960]   I love it.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   I love it.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.720]   Hey, Jerry, how's Inferno 2 going, by the way?
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.760]   Beyond January, they're talking about promoting it.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.040]   The title of the book apparently is going to be "Escape from Hell."
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:07.160]   And we're booked on some talk shows with themes like, "Are you going to burn in hell?"
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.160]   You and Larry Niven.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   Yeah, really.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.160]   That's great.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.000]   And Niven, God knows what Niven will say.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.280]   I never do.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.120]   You stay out of that discussion?
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.960]   No, I usually have to do most of the discussion.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.720]   But then Larry will come with Lucifer's hammer.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:36.480]   Here I'm trying to write a very accurate, technologically accurate book, right?
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.840]   Niven throws that damn surfer in.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:44.640]   And that's the only thing anybody remembers about the book.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.320]   We got a huge review in Nature magazine this month.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.040]   I mean, a really great review of a 30-year-old book.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   Wow.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   Amazing.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.560]   But of course, the first paragraph is about the damn surfer.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   You sound bitter.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   You sound bitter.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.560]   No, I'm not bitter.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.640]   Look, I know Larry writes better than I do.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.280]   I think better than he does.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280]   There you go.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   Between us.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.640]   Between us, we write damn good books.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   You make one pretty good novel.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.880]   Not that many collaborative authorships like that, congratulations.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   It is kind of amazing, isn't it?
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:31.800]   No, Nordolf and Hall with Moudnion the Bounty is one of the few that's made more money than
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800]   we have.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800]   Wow.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800]   That's collaborators.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.240]   Well, Jerry, I really appreciate you joining us with some memories of Bill Gates.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   This was kind of a special to it.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:50.440]   Even though John says it's a scam, a scam full of sound and fury and signifying nothing,
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.760]   I think it was worth spending a little time to think about this guy.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.000]   Oh, you might as well, Paul, I think it's sort of Guinness Book of Records thing going
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   on here.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Well, let's face it.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.480]   Whether or not he's retiring.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.520]   He's written these spears in total page views yesterday.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.240]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.760]   You could be a pregnant fat.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.760]   Never mind.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.000]   I'm not going to go any farther than this.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   She's lost some weight.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   She looks good now.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.480]   Or you could be a geek and he's doing it for us.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.200]   He's doing it for the geeks of the world.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.480]   I think whatever you say about Bill Gates, I think he can only say good things about what
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.000]   he's done for the technology industry and what he's done for personal computing.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.840]   He's been a benefactor and a boon to it.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   Anybody disagree?
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.320]   Oh, John, you're looking funny yet.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.480]   I think you're a bit too much.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:43.200]   I've often wondered what would have happened if Dotty hadn't refused to sign that non-disclosure
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:51.440]   agreement and Gary and his outfit had been the ones to write the operating system for
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   the IBM PC.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.640]   It wouldn't have been the same way.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.440]   As you said, digital research could have written it, but they don't have the instinct.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.680]   Jerry, there's always a rule that was going and still believed in the Valley as the following.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:08.240]   If someone company doesn't take over and dominate everything, some other company will take over
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.920]   and dominate everything.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.160]   So it had just been the same thing with a different company.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.080]   That's just the way the whole tech business has been, especially the tech business that
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.240]   stems from the semiconductor industry, which operates that way.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.880]   Yes, but suppose that company had been IBM.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.960]   Well, it was for 20 years, the 50s and 60s.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.320]   It seems unlikely because they had already gone through their period of dominance.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.840]   I've never seen a company do a comeback like that.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:42.000]   But then there was a compact to the IBM and there were all the Eagles to the compacts
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.440]   and everybody else's.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:54.240]   The industry was too big and had too much upside potential for any one company to dominate
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.440]   the hardware side, but it did need one company to call the shots on the operating system.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   That's partially true, Bill.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   But wait, one company did dominate the hardware side in tell.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   That's true.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440]   Infrastructure.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.360]   But you needed that operating system.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.240]   You need that consistent operating system to make it the whole...
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.960]   It did have to be Microsoft, though.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   Well, it wasn't Apple.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.720]   Well, actually it was digital research because they copied MS-DOS.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.400]   Tim Patterson rewrote it as...
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   Right.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.400]   CPM-related.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   You know.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   No, but it's...
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   Where is Tim Patterson these days and why isn't he speaking up?
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   They gave him some money to shut up.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:42.520]   You know that in DOS 1, you could make Gary Kildal's name appear on your screen.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.520]   Yeah, I've heard that.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.120]   Well, I thought he was hurting.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.360]   Gary showed it to me.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   Really?
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Yeah, there was a...
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   How did you do that?
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   Oh, hell.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   I don't know.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   He was in some...
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   He was in some...
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   He was in some...
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   He was left in by accident.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.120]   He was left in by accident.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.400]   That's pretty serious proof of their contention.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400]   Well, yeah.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.800]   Which is why Kildal died a very rich man.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.360]   Uh-huh.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.400]   And why, whoever owns...
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:21.400]   CPM will never have a look and feel a lawsuit.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   Uh-huh.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400]   Who does own CPM?
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   Saw water under the bridge.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.880]   Well, it's gone now.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.680]   That's why I got you old guys on.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   Got new.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   Experts, experts on water under the bridge, ladies.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   It's about it.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   We rock.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:41.840]   But I do wonder if Gary had done it, he didn't have the ambition Bill did.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.680]   He would not have tried to build an enormous software house out of it.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   He would have been happy to take the revenue from IBM and let IBM do it.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.680]   Right.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.680]   And interestingly...
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.800]   Now, who have dominated the operating systems was going to have a lot of revenue.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.920]   Would they have invested it in the ways that Bill did?
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.560]   Single best deal probably in the last 50 years...
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560]   Good investment.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.200]   Was the deal to give IBM DOS without giving it to them?
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.960]   But licensing it per copy.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.960]   Right.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   Right.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   And I don't want to...
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   We're all...
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   This show should be over by now.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   I was trying to wrap it up.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.960]   Let's bring up the one thing.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   We got to remember Seymour Roode.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   Maybe you'll get a second show.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   We got to remember Seymour Roode.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.640]   Who's the guy who promoted the concept of licensing, shrink wrap licenses.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.400]   Largely his invention, actually he was taken from it some ideas he had.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   And he was running...
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:48.040]   He was pretty much the dominant player until he was scammed out of his company while he
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.480]   was supposedly...
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.640]   Or they tricked him into thinking he was on his deathbed when he wasn't.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640]   They're kidding.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   No, it's a great story.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   It's a great story.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.400]   Seymour Roode and sign over WordStar.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.640]   No, Seymour Roode, you got to sign a proxy over for me to run...
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.280]   You did that.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   His family?
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.400]   No, the guy who took over the company, Haney, I think was his name.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.080]   There was some real scamming going on in the...
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.240]   But whatever the case was, that company could have just as easily become some domineering
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:23.600]   company because they had the same kind of hard ball style of marketing and...
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.800]   Pushing people around.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.600]   All you guys are convinced me of is that you needed a Bill Gates to make any of this work
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.520]   and that Bill Gates was the guy, the only guy who was able to make it all happen.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.360]   We all we know it theoretically, but all we do know is that Bill was never really an
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.880]   evil person, so that's a plus.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.440]   Yes, definitely.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440]   So...
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440]   I liked it.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   You liked him?
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.840]   Yeah, well I have to make it up.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.840]   I still do, but...
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:49.840]   He's not a...
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840]   He's a like a guy.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840]   He's not going to tell a phone me anymore.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.160]   He doesn't tell a phone anymore, so he never will.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.880]   He's kind of a good looking in this picture here.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.400]   It's not like we're going to power around, but he still says hello to me and...
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.160]   Yeah, he says hello, if he sees you.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.560]   Well, I'm glad we could do this show with some guys who still think Bill is a nice guy
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560]   and not evil.

[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.760]   We're actually going to put a site together that just consolidates everything.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.400]   Yeah, I keep saying that too.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   Yeah, I know.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.640]   That's all I've been saying it for a while.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.240]   Jerry Pournell, it's so great to have you on, as usual.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.680]   I'm glad you're feeling better.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.680]   That's wonderful news.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.640]   Yeah, it's JerryPournell.com.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.520]   We know that.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520]   We know that.

[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.520]   It's really great to hear from you.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.320]   I'm glad your voice sounds so much better.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.760]   You sound like you're in great spirits, great energy.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.520]   Up to 50,000 rads of heart and great.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.720]   I guarantee you.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.720]   I'm impressed.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   It's great to be back.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.720]   I bet.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.720]   That'll wake you up.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.720]   Good morning, Bill.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   Character.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   And Bill McCrone, you're the best.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   McCrone.net.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.960]   Even though you don't really care.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.240]   Well, I put a couple of more things there, but not much.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.560]   I do have to mention that this show is brought to you by the good folks at audible.com.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.480]   I'm always glad to audible sponsors all of our Twit programs and they are a really
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480]   great source.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.280]   Jerry, you have some books on audible.com, I think.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280]   Yes.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280]   We did this last time.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.280]   And more?
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.400]   My major just made another deal.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:48.360]   I don't know what they are, but I just got about $5,000 advances from audible.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.480]   So apparently some more of my stuff is going on there.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.120]   I couldn't be happier to hear that.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.120]   You're buying.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.120]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   Lunches on Jerry.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.200]   You know, the only way to make a living in this business is to sell stuff you wrote
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.400]   30 years ago.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.240]   Well, it's not a bad way to make a living.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.680]   It takes less works.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.000]   Currently, Star Swarm, which is one of your juveniles, is up on there, but I look forward
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   to more.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.080]   They bought a, they're doing their own sci-fi stuff now, which may be the deal that you
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   made.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.480]   I was over there on Monday and they have I think.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.480]   I think it was.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.800]   Yeah, I think they have eight studios now.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   I recorded a short.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   How'd you do in your record?
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   It's really fun.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   I did a little kids book.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   Yeah, it's best you can do.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   I wanted what do you want.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   It had to be public domain.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.000]   I wanted mutiny on the bounty or something read by you.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   Call me Ishmael.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.280]   No, I did.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   I was fun.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.840]   I was, they couldn't afford little red riding hoods.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   So they got.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   Mr. Christian.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.240]   Mr. Christmum.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.080]   They got a little golden riding hood.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.680]   It was apparently the variant that was in public domain.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.680]   Oh, the original.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680]   Maybe it is.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   Yeah, it might be a prequel.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   So I read that and that was really fun.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.560]   They're going to offer that for free, but they have many, many great books.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.360]   And I have to say the science fiction, I found out that because I, the first time I went
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.800]   to Audible, which was in 2000, it was eight years ago, that was underwhelmed by their
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.200]   science fiction selection.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.560]   But I found out that one of their principles, therefore, who's a great guy, is a huge science
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.720]   fiction fan.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.360]   And he's done a yeoman-like job of getting some of the best sci-fi in the world on there.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.520]   And it's growing all the time.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.720]   Charlie may need to mow the God's eye.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.120]   I think you're right.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.840]   Hey, but by the way, I, now we, Jerry, we got Jerry.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.920]   I wanted to ask you something, Jerry.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:28.000]   Do you think you're underrepresented at that, at that crazy Paul Allen Museum up in Seattle?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   The sci-fi museum.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.240]   I mean, you know, you know, the one thing I found in that was.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.000]   Well, yeah, but remember what it was.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Well, that was.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   It was the Jimmy Hendrix Museum.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.800]   It was the, you know, the, the museum in Lincoln, Nebraska from the University of
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800]   Nebraska.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   Oh, is that where he got that?
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.240]   And he just bought it and turned it into that.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.120]   So, well, you're so some moth-eaten sci-fi.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.120]   It's legacy.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   It's legacy from a university science fiction club.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   Well, he couldn't.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.840]   And Jimmy Gunn's job, English department.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840]   Oh, that was interesting.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.960]   So, Jimmy Gunn, James, God is in there, for instance, neither Neven nor Eilard.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.080]   Well, here's another one that cracked me up.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.680]   I was going through that thing.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:15.080]   I was actually, I found it kind of insulting to a lot of the writers that were missing.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.560]   And for example, they had some of those little tribbles that David Gerald, who I guess was
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.880]   marketing or somebody was selling his little balls of fur.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.400]   They had them in there, but no mention of David Gerald in the entire place.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.080]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.080]   Who's David Gerald?
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.840]   David Gerald wrote the trouble with tribbles.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   He's a science fiction writer.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.840]   He's a friend of Jerry's.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.840]   We both know him.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.640]   David's a good writer.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.960]   He's a good...
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   I love him.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   He's a great guy.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.520]   So they're more into the merchandising than they are to their writers.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.600]   No, I don't think anybody really pays attention to how they know.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.600]   They need a curator.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.600]   They need a curator.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.600]   That's what it's brought.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.600]   That's ridiculous that that means he's not curating.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.680]   They need somebody who knows what he's doing.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.560]   They don't have Ron Hubbard in there.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.080]   Now, you may think Hubbard was crazy or not.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.560]   He's got to be in there.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:10.560]   He was enormously significant to the history of science.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560]   Yeah, you're bad.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.920]   And yet he's not in there.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.400]   Yeah, the whole thing is it's embarrassing.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:23.720]   Well, I mean, the fact that I'm not in there may or may not be insignificant, but it is
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.880]   certainly bloody significant that Larry Nivet is not in there.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.440]   No, you should be in there anyway.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.120]   See, here's the thing I like about Audible.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.680]   But you're in the science fiction section, they've got, they've now divided it, alternate
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.360]   realities, classics, dramatizations, epic fantasy, fantasy, hard sci-fi, which is my
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   favorite category, short story space exploration, kid and young adults, they have a complete,
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.760]   they get in the point now where they can really break it down.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.400]   So I just want to know those people, tell them that mode would be a very good mode and
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.000]   God's eye would be a great thing for them to put in.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   Yeah, it's a classic.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   That's an important book.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   They should put that in.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   It's a little lips to God's eye.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.640]   I will tell Don Katz and we'll get it in there for sure.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   I think we're done.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:12.280]   What you have to do, Jerry, is come up with some little three handed dolls with a big arm
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.880]   on one side, two little arms on the other side.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:21.480]   I've already got a phrase that everybody's using on the one hand and on the other hand
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.480]   and on the gripping hand.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.960]   On the gripping hand.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.120]   How did I feel that one goes?
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.680]   I love it.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.960]   So seriously, if you get those into the museum shop, then you just follow on their little
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   coat tails.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.120]   I might point out that Jerry also claims credit for Tinstoffel.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   Never heard of it.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.120]   Tinstoffel, which...
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.600]   Ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.320]   Did you give that to Heinlein?
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320]   Yes.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.520]   I have a letter from Robert acknowledging it.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.600]   I think that's significant.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.600]   What is it?
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.400]   If you've learned one thing here today, you've learned that Tinstoffel was really...
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.600]   There is no such thing as a free lunch.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.840]   Ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.480]   Oh, he's not impressed.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.200]   No, I'm very impressed and totally impressed.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   He's knocked out.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   He's just knocked for a little bit.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.200]   I'm sure sounded.

[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   Thank you.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.280]   Bill McCrone, you're the best.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.640]   Oh, it's a pleasure.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.840]   If it weren't for Bill, I never would have had a career in television.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.680]   That's true.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.760]   That is true.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.840]   I meet young guys who listen to this show and I tell them that, yeah, we recruited you way
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.840]   back when?
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.840]   Way back when?
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.840]   For original TV TV.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840]   That's right.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.160]   Wow, that's great.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.400]   You know Leo?
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.480]   Some day they'll say you're doing the same thing to me.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.480]   You know Colleen?
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.560]   I am a friend of Leo.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.080]   Well, I'm a friend of Leo.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.080]   Thank you.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.400]   We'll get that for you.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.400]   Thank you, Bill McCrone.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.040]   John C. DeVorroco gave me my start in radio.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.880]   So, you know, I got all my benefactors here.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   Wow.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.640]   Well, not radio per se, but in tech radio.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   I was doing regular radio.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   You were doing the deal.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   No credibility.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   Yeah, and then the granny.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.240]   I don't know if Leo actually appreciates my mentioning this, but he is actually one of
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:34.680]   the few, it's probably many radio personalities that was actually bumped off the air.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.240]   By Rush Limbaugh.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.080]   550 of us were bumped off the air by Rush.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   Is that right?
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.080]   It should be a club.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.480]   We should have a little club.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   A bump club.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.200]   Rush Limbaugh killed me and put me out of business, although he put me in business really.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.680]   He's actually did you a favor.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.880]   If it weren't for Rush Limbaugh, I wouldn't be sitting here today on this small internet
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.320]   channel with probably more listeners and viewers that you've ever had on radio.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.520]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   We'll see you next week.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   Another tweet.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   This is amazing.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   Is in the can.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520]   All right.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.880]   Do you want to do video?
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.880]   Awesome.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   We can do video.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.680]   We have to part well.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680]   Forget it.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:19.320]   Look at all I'm doing here.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.120]   I mean, this is hard work.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.200]   He used to be a combo man at a radio station.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.000]   He can't get over it.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   All right.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   I should have paid attention.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.560]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560]   Too much work.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.880]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.880]   So here's the deal.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.120]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120]   What blue screen's like, forget it.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.120]   I'm killing you.

[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.120]   I'm killing you.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.120]   I'm killing you.
