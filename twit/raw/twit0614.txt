[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.800]   Mainstream Media want you to think that the Wanna Cry hack is over, but folks, it's still
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.800]   ongoing.

[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.520]   And of course in France, they've owned the hackers.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   It's all coming up on Twit.

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.800]   This week in Tech, it's the show where we go through the Tech world, like your mom going
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.920]   through your laundry, looking for the best news to wear.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.520]   I'm Father Robert Balissar in for Leo LaPorte, who is currently exploring his spiritual side
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   in Colorado.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   But, of course, I'm not going to be by myself.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.360]   I'm going to need the help of some experts in this wonderful field of technology, starting
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.200]   on my left with Mr. Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   Hey, expert, though.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.120]   I wouldn't go quite as far as expert.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.600]   He's known as the Tech Scream.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.640]   Of course, the editor in chief at Crunchbase.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   Good to see you.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   Good to be here.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.960]   You know, I've seen you so many times, and I've never actually met you in person.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.520]   I've actually done throws to your video clips on this show.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.560]   And next up we got, and then you would come on, I'm like, "I really got to meet that guy."
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.320]   I just need to make sure you actually exist in your digital order.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   I am corporeal.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   You are.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   You are.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   Okay, fantastic, fantastic.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   Jay proof.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.760]   And next to him, the man poking Alex is Mr. Roberto Baldwin.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   He's within gadget.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.480]   Roberto, I also have never met you in person.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   Thank you very much for coming home.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.640]   I'm a secretive man.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   I have a cave that I live in, and I'm not quite sure what I'm doing on the show.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.240]   You're here because we need the knowledge, sir.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   You've got knowledge.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   I can tell you all about raccoons, cave things, cars.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   Where do you live?
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   Are you in San Francisco?
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   I live in the city, yeah.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   You are.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   You're also in the city.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   So there's three of us in this.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   I don't think that's ever happened before.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Three people from San Francisco on the same twit battle.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.600]   Well, then it's going to be the coolest and best twit or the absolute worst over twit.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   I can't decide.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   It'll devolve into us just arguing over the best burrito.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   Can we gentrify that?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   That's not an argument.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.880]   That's the best burrito is actually here in Petaluma.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   It's false.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   Oh, Roy's.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   This is not--
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   The rumble in the background was going to take the audience to the audience to the audience
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   afterwards.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   They can decide.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   But it is the best.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   False.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   Okay.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.520]   Someone who will not be arguing about burritos, but giving us quality tech reporter is, well,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.560]   Christina Warren, who I want to say is tech journalist icon, but soon will be Mike.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   What kind of tech is the tech resource icon?
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.640]   Christina, how much of this can you tell us?
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.440]   I mean, I can share what I'm going to be doing.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.880]   So yeah, so my last say at Gizmodo, where I'd worked for almost a year, was on Friday.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.680]   And after 10 years in tech journalism, I am no longer a tech journalist.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   I am-- for the next week, I'm unemployed.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   But no, I'm going to be moving to Seattle and packing up my apartment right now.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.360]   And I will be a senior content project manager in Microsoft's online learning division working
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.320]   on Microsoft Virtual Academy.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.480]   So I'm excited.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   Oh, congratulations.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   But I--
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   Thank you.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.640]   I have to ask, we established before the show started that aside from me, everyone here
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   is a millennial.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.640]   Yes.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   No, I'm very old.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   Oh, no.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   Okay.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   Okay.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   There's two of us who are millennials.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   Okay.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   The extreme sides of the panel are millennials.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   I thought millennials were never unemployed.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   They were just between gigs.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   The phrase is fun-employed, I think actually.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   Fun-employed.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   Fun-employed.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.400]   It's that liminal state between bumming off your parents and middle-of-the-pay for your
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   own rent.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   It's fantastic.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.320]   And actually, you know, it's kind of nice.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.440]   I've only been between gigs once or fun-employed once since I did this organization.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.280]   And I got to say, it was very freeing.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.080]   Yeah, I threw weeks off in January.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   I changed jobs.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.120]   And I ended up with more free time than I expected.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.000]   And so I got super bored really fast.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.640]   Day two, I was like going to the gym twice a day because I had nothing to do.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   And it was horrible.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.800]   And then I just left for a couple of weeks.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.560]   Yeah, I remember going to the gym twice a day.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.080]   So my gap week, I'm moving across the country.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.520]   So I do not have free time.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.000]   So you have to move to Redmond?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I have to move to Redmond.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   So I'm in Brooklyn and like the movers and packers are coming on Tuesday and we fly out on Friday.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   So-
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   Are you not driving?
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.720]   Driving is awesome.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.400]   Fun-fun fact for everyone.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.360]   I don't have a driver's license.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.520]   So that's going to be really fun for me to figure out in Seattle.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.600]   It's like, trying to figure out like, do I get a car?
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   You have to get-
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.080]   If you're on the west coast, you have to have a car.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.680]   Well, my husband's going to get a car.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.640]   The bigger question is do I?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   And I'm not sure.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.280]   Because there is public transit and stuff.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.440]   So we will figure that out.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   But I don't know.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   Are you going to be in Seattle?
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.640]   Are you going to be in Bellevue, Kirkland?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   Like, where are you going to be?
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   I don't know.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   I don't know.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.160]   Because that matters a lot about the car question.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   Exactly.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.280]   We have a temporary place to stay for a couple months.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.360]   And then we'll figure out the living situation.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.040]   Yeah, just remember, it's not just about transportation.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.880]   On the east coast, I know, because I've lived on the east coast, having a car is difficult
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   just because there's nowhere to put it without paying it because it's over to my money.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.120]   There's parking on the west coast.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.320]   We can put our cars places.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.600]   So I know you don't believe me now, but driving can be an enjoyable experience.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.520]   I don't believe you, but I will get that a thought.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   All right, let's go ahead.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   I'll come into it.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.240]   Let's jump in because we do actually have a rare opportunity to talk about a new story
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.880]   that didn't just break, but is still breaking.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.960]   And one that unlike a lot of other tech stories, the non-tech press has picked up and ran
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.280]   with it because it is so big and it's so impactful.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.360]   Of course, we're talking about WannaCry.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.480]   Now, there's a couple of things that we know about WannaCry.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.040]   We know that it was developed from the leaked eternal blue that was released by the shadow
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040]   brokers.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   That was an NSA tool.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.680]   By the way, one of the very first reporters to pick up this story was our very own Kurt
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   Franklin, who is a co-host on this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   Now, we know that the initial infection was via e-mailed link or attachment.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.160]   So this was a, it looked like a phishing attack, but once infected, a computer would check
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.520]   a domain to see if it responded.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.360]   It would exploit an SMB vulnerability in some versions of Windows in order to spread laterally.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.480]   So once you had a computer on a network that was infected, it could infect other vulnerable
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.400]   computers on that network, then it installed the double pulsar backdoor, which was interesting
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.560]   because that would stay even if you paid the ransom because this is crypto, crypto ware.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   And of course, it would demand $300 in Bitcoin.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.000]   Now, we have to wait for the numbers because they're still kind of trickling in, but anecdotally,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.040]   it looks like we're talking about over 200,000 systems.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.920]   It's probably going to end up being in the half a million systems by the time this thing
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.080]   is done.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.160]   It seems as if XP is taking the brunt of the attack.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.440]   10, as far as we know, is not vulnerable.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   8, I think unless you've got one of the very first versions, it's not vulnerable.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   So we're talking about XP, Vista, and Windows 7, but Windows 7 probably not because it's
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.400]   probably been patched.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:29.560]   Now, again, the first impact was hundreds of thousands of systems followed by 150 countries,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.800]   including Europe, Asia, some of the Americas.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.320]   Continence, not continents.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   Continence, yes.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.480]   It's shut down manufacturing at Renault in France and Romania, shut down manufacturing
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.680]   at Nissan in England.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.160]   It also affected, and this was the big one.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.520]   This is the one that caught people's attention, health services in Britain, which evidently
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.800]   are running Windows XP.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.040]   And you actually had to have patients who were diverted because systems weren't working,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.000]   the intake systems weren't working.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.200]   Now, let's start with that because that's a good background.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.680]   Is this, as people are calling it, this is the very first worldwide cyber attack?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.120]   The one that people have looked to and said, "Okay, this is what we were waiting for.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   It's finally here."
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.880]   I don't know if I'd go ahead and say it's the absolute first one, but it certainly meets
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.200]   the scale we've been promised.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   People say, "This is going to come.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   Is it going to happen?"
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.800]   Eventually, down the pike, it's going to whack you in the face super hard.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.160]   And this is at least meeting that bill of sale.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.640]   I mean, there was actually a photo I saw on Twitter on the way up here of a Russian-trained
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.840]   control area, and so the screens actually just blocked off with the same malware we saw
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.160]   a second ago until they couldn't run the trains.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.320]   I mean, this was global and systemic across our important infrastructure and our life.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   So I think it meets all thresholds of crisis.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   Christina, what about it?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.440]   Is this the digital Pearl Harbor?
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.520]   I mean, I don't know if it's that, but it could be.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.600]   I mean, it certainly had the potential to be.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   I mean, at least the first attack was mitigated, but now we have all of these other variants
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   that are coming out.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   It's certainly scary.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.360]   I mean, I think it could be.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   Why do they only ask for $300?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.240]   It's actually this is very well-sput studied.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.720]   That's the pain threshold.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   Really?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   Three numbers in below.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   People are saying, "That's less than the time it would take me to fix my system."
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.840]   Above $300, people are saying, "I'll just go to a backup."
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.960]   So the $300 is the sweet spot, sweet spot, pain point, whatever that thing.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   That's amazing.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.560]   I mean, I was told that all the crypto from this is flowing to three separate wallets.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.720]   Three separate wallets total.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.360]   But I mean, it can't be that much money in aggregate if it's only $300 per.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.720]   I heard one of like $3K in it.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.320]   But I mean, to me, the amount of chaos has been caused for this small dollar amount.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.080]   It's really out of whack.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.840]   What a bit of mischief for some change?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.480]   I mean, a lot for me personally.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.400]   Well, I mean, if you're just building, if you want to do it for the laws or you just
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.920]   want for a little bit of cash, or you might be looking at local laws, like, you know,
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.680]   like anything above a certain amount would, you know, go from a misdemeanor to a felony
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.680]   or whatever.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.240]   I mean, you have to, there's a lot of things that plus, like you said, the threshold,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   if you're more likely to get $300 and $5,000.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   Right.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   Because you're like, "You know what?
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   I'll just go to the bank.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   I'll get $300.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   We'll pay it.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.120]   We just want this off of here."
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.360]   They've actually done studies about this because this is not the first crypto ransom software
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.560]   that we've seen in the wild where, yeah, $600, that's too much.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   People won't pay $600.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.400]   That's on the most part, unless it compromised a vital system versus $300, which is, you
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   know, $300, less than a third of a Bitcoin, that's something that people are willing to
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.760]   look at and say, "You know what?
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.640]   It's worth me not being annoyed."
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.880]   I just love it that it's 17.6% of a Bitcoin is fine.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.240]   0.5 Bitcoin is way too much.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   That's the year.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   I want to think.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.040]   But regular people don't think in Bitcoin.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   They just say $300.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.600]   They're like, "You know what?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.040]   That's less than an Xbox or whatever.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.840]   I could just pay it and be done with it."
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.400]   I've read things before and I don't know how it works in this case, but I know that
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.160]   in other ransomware attacks, even getting people who are willing to pay the $300, going
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.720]   through the process of buying in Bitcoin and going through that is a challenge in and of
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   itself.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.000]   You wonder, too, there might be people who are willing to pay $300 but aren't willing to
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.320]   go through the hassle of going through a Bitcoin exchange and signing up for those accounts
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.520]   and connecting things and setting up a wallet and transferring stuff over.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.760]   You have to wonder, too, how much potential, why maybe the amounts are less just because
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   depending on who your target is, they might not be willing or able to go through that process.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.160]   That all sounds very valid, but the fact that they shut down the NHS for less than the price
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.760]   of a three-day pass to outside lands, ironic in some ways.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   It's kind of funny to me.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.760]   It's more like a thing about it.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600]   They don't know where it's going to go, though.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.120]   I mean, they release it into the wild and they just assume it's going to hit certain
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   computers that are vital.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120]   That is so irresponsible.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.080]   I mean, Robbie made a good point about like, for the lulls, you can't be that indiscriminate
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.400]   and that awful for the lulls unless you really have no-
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.720]   No, that's really what for the lulls is, though.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.080]   Unless you look at it, you say, "Okay, what percentage of computers are running Windows
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080]   95?
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.960]   What percentage of computers are not patched?"
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.160]   And you're just like, "You know what, if we just ask for $300, every single hospital,
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.800]   there's a lot of hospitals, that's $300, every single small mom and pop shop, $300,
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.040]   every single little place, it's still running Windows 95 because A, they can't afford to
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.880]   update their hardware or their software.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.640]   B, they're using legacy software that they need for their business.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.400]   A lot of hospitals have to use old stuff for their business.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.600]   People are like, "Why didn't you patch it?"
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.120]   Because if they do, it'll break something that's very important to keeping somebody
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.040]   alive somewhere.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.240]   There was a great thread on Twitter, I think, from a Microsoft employee who works on .NET
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.760]   stuff and he was kind of talking about how these $15 million MRI machines are running
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   Windows XP embedded because when the machines were created, that was the most up-to-date
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.320]   modern embedded system you could use.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.280]   But the manufacturer might be gone and getting a patch and getting things done is very complicated
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.080]   and there are a lot of things that go into why something can or can't be updated.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.680]   It's not simple as to say, "Well, just update it because maybe the manufacturer is in business
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.920]   or maybe support has been outsourced out to a lot of different areas."
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.440]   As you were saying, Robert, if updating one thing could break a bunch of other things
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.720]   and air-gapping and things like that and isolating things, then that work is great, but you still
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.640]   need systems that need to talk to one another.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.680]   It's a really complex problem to solve, especially when you're looking at organizations like
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   the NHS or hospitals in general where funds are cut all the time and they don't have big
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:38.120]   budgets to have people, security as maybe as up-to-date as much of a priority as it is.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   It becomes very expensive to look at replacing certain systems that are working just because
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.160]   of something else.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.360]   It's a really, really complicated problem when you start talking about these sorts of
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.400]   very important vital systems like hospitals.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.720]   I think that whoever created this, that'll be a very interesting thing is to figure out
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.840]   who's behind this depending on what part of the world they're from, even $300, even $30,000
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.920]   could be a lot of money to them.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.720]   If this continues to go on and affect more and more users and more and more people pay
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.400]   up, it could expand that money, the value for them could go up to.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.480]   Well, let's talk a little bit about the mitigation because here's a few of the things that we
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   know.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.840]   We know that it didn't hit the United States as hard as it hit Europe for a couple of reasons.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   One, we're on weekend.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.920]   So everything is shut down already.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.680]   Two, by the time it rolled around to the United States, people knew about the attack and so
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   the phishing emails were being blocked upstream.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.760]   So that really, really helped.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.960]   And then of course, there was the accidental discovery.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   There's a British researcher.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.720]   All we know is that he's known as @malwaretechblog.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.520]   He works for an LA-based threat intelligence company, but he lives probably in southwest
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.640]   England.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.160]   He was looking at the traffic that the malware was generating and he noticed that it was
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.440]   speaking to a domain that did not exist.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.240]   And so he registered the domain and the attacks abated.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.040]   If you were already infected, it didn't work.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.200]   But if the malware tried to install itself on the system and it did receive a ping back
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   from that entry, which was wannacry.com or wannacry.org, then it wouldn't install itself.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   It was a kill switch.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   So he found that.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   By accident.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   By accident.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   But it worked.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   He did it.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.160]   Now here's the fun part.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   And I really want to get your input on this because you've got the non-tech press and
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.920]   even some of the tech press seen at CBS got caught up in this saying, well, that was
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.120]   a bad attack, wasn't it?
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.880]   And it's as if it's over.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.680]   It's like no.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.840]   In fact, this morning, we've had security researchers who have been verifying on Twitter, there
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.440]   is a second variant in the wild and they remove the kill switch that will not work anymore.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   That's what it was.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   I'm not even that.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   It's not all the takedown.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   You can correct that mistake.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.880]   But I mean, for $11 and some experimentation points to that guy for saving a lot of people
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   a lot of money.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   Yes.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   Absolutely.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   So when I read that story, I thought it was almost like a joke.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   Like this can't really be what happened.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.240]   But sometimes it also shows the power of one person tinkering around the edges even against
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   a global catastrophe.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   I like that idea.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.400]   It was from what I understand, it was just a standard honey pot.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.000]   So he had a Windows XP honey pot.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.200]   He had a tap.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.600]   He got, he watched the infection traffic and then he's like, oh, what's this domain?
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Oh, it's not registered.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Let me register it.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.360]   That fixed it.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.680]   I can track it with this tap.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.000]   I can track the pings coming from all the different IPs and he's like, oh, well, I fixed
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Everyone came to me.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.600]   It's like the person who made the variants just like, oh, well, yeah, let me just take
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   that.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   Let me just take out that check.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   There we go.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   Check it.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   Back out in the world.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.400]   Well, the story that I read about this particular solution was that when they first
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.720]   did it, they thought they made a mistake and had made it worse.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   And they were like, oh, no.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   And they were freaking out.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   And then turns out, no, it's the direct opposite.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.800]   But you can imagine the emotional whiplash you would go through like, wow, what's this?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   I've made it worse.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   Never mind.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.040]   I mean, that's a million things three minutes.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.600]   I don't know if I can take that kind of thermal.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.080]   That's an emotional roller coaster.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Do we take it down?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.880]   Unlike Devo, which is not emotional.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   It was bad music.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.320]   We're not going there.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.720]   No, Devo is good music.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   It's different.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.960]   You just can't listen to it every day.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   I just for Robbie, sorry.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   They have the hats.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   They have the hats.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   They have the hats.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   Great hats.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.600]   We tried to actually buy some Devo hats to wear on the show today, but we couldn't figure
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.080]   out to get him shipped here fast enough.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.160]   We got a 3D printed them for you.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.160]   We did not think it's that.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   Okay.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   All right.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   Let's talk about the story that I find kind of interesting.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.400]   One of, I won't mention which one, but a US ISP decided they were going to protect their
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.320]   clients by blocking the domain.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.000]   Someone had to reach out to them and say, "That's actually the absolute worst thing you
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   could do."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Why would you do that?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   No, because they thought, "Oh, attack traffic.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   We'll kill it."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   It's like, "No, no, no.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.160]   That was the kill signal.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.840]   You just blocked the kill signal."
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.080]   It's amazing that even some "technically minded" people didn't actually read the story.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.760]   They saw the domain and they said, "Domain must be bad.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.480]   It gets added to the blacklist."
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   That's actually been happening a lot.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.880]   That's because no one understands security.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.360]   Security is so complex.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.920]   The number of journalists I know who I actually would trust to explain security to me is very
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   few.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.360]   Like, Zach would occur from ZDNet and one of two other people.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.920]   Zach's fantastic, but he's almost one of a kind.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.480]   We have a story of his later on in the rundown, but I do not write about security on purpose
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.680]   because I always feel like a charlatan and I'm always covering up for lack of personal
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   knowledge.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.400]   I feel like that's not abnormal in the field.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.360]   Writing for security is scary because it's so easy to get wrong.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.120]   It's so incredibly easy to get it wrong.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.880]   I mean, I cover security, but I lean on a lot of senior security experts.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.960]   I lean a lot on security researchers.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.040]   You got to call those people.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   You got to talk to them on the phone.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.520]   You got to let them walk you through what's going on because if you try to write it in
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.480]   a vacuum, which a lot of tech press does, for a lot of things, like, "Well, I just know.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.000]   I'm just going to write this thing."
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   With security, you can't do that.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.920]   You have to talk to people.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.320]   You have to talk to these researchers.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.600]   You have to get their knowledge and put it in your article because if you don't, you're
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.480]   just spreading a lot of bad information, which is worse.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.080]   Yeah, and you have to make sure that you're talking to the right researchers because sometimes
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.880]   they, you know what I mean?
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.480]   They're just like they're kind of, you feel like a charlatan as a journalist.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.880]   There can be charlatans in the security community too.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.480]   It really becomes imperative to know you're talking to the right people, explaining it
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   the right way, being accurate.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   I mean, I'm glad I don't have to do this anymore because it's easy to get it wrong.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.560]   It can be very bad when you get it wrong.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.880]   As you were stating, the fact that people thought, "Okay, because of this first variant,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.760]   this kill switch was found, oh, well, that's over."
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.080]   It's like, "No, this is literally just the beginning and it's easy to get caught up in
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   their rhetoric."
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.120]   It's also bad too, I think, that what makes security difficult is that we have so many
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.240]   stories that are like, "Oh, this is the worst thing ever," that I think that the general
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.320]   public has a certain sense of malaise and learns to just kind of ignore all the big threats
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.760]   so that when you have a situation like this, which really could be like the worst thing
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.760]   ever, I don't know how serious the people take it.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:09.240]   Yeah, I always trust the security researchers I know from DEF CON, from Black Hat, the ones
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   that I've known for the years.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.800]   And they are almost never the people that you see in the headlines because they don't
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.920]   believe in this, "I'm going to get it out first, I'm going to get it right, and then
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   I'm going to tell you what's going on."
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.560]   I love that analysis.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.880]   But Christina, you brought up the point of the general public, we've got to ask because
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.360]   any time you get to a general public story, there's always going to be the question, "Well,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.720]   whose fault is this?"
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   And there's a lot of that.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.880]   In fact, the New York Times put out an op-ed today essentially saying, "Microsoft, this is
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   on you."
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   Boom.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.680]   And I could not disagree more.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.480]   This is a patch that was put out for most of Windows in March of 2017.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   They actually released a free patch for Server 2003 and XP, even though they don't have
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   to anymore.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.960]   Those products are end of life.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   They're dead.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   They're dead.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.240]   And they've been warning you that's going to be dead for years.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.320]   They stamped up and down on that issue month after month, get off, get off, get off.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.720]   But this op-ed says, "Yes, I know.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.800]   It's end of life.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.400]   I know that they've been telling us, but doesn't Microsoft have a responsibility to make sure
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.720]   something like this can't happen?"
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   Oh, call me.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   Call me.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   No.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   It's not.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, that really kind of goes back to the sky is falling.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.520]   It's got to be someone's fault.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.920]   It's a nature of the beast is what it is.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   It's hard to point blame.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.160]   Clearly, it's the people who made this.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.960]   It's the NSA who had this exploit and they were holding on to it.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.280]   And then they were shotty security, loud it out.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.120]   But to yell at Microsoft is ridiculous.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.880]   It's like when you yell at Microsoft because some third party hasn't made it a driver for
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.000]   the newest version of Windows.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.080]   And you can't yell at the hospitals.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.880]   You can't yell at these businesses because, like I said, some of them, they don't have
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   a choice.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.680]   They have to use these legacy systems if you want to get, like you said, an MRI, if you
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.240]   wanted to get a CT scan, if you wanted to do all this stuff.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   So it's a sort of weird nature of the beast and to have this op ed that says, well, it's
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.120]   Microsoft's fault, it sort of misses the point.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:12.080]   And it really simplifies the issue, which is we have created these systems that don't,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.280]   that you can't update.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.400]   And there's not really anything you can do that because you're talking about 100 machines
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.880]   that are 100, 200, 300 thousand dollars, you're not going to update it because you're like,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.360]   oh, we need to put Windows 10 on here.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.320]   You know, but we need to get patients in here.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.200]   We need to take care of this.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.880]   Really importantly, about 45 minutes ago, Snowden tweeted a new Microsoft blog post from your
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   security team.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.480]   And especially I think Brad Smith, who's on their kind of corporate legal side of things.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.440]   And the Snowden tweet was, Microsoft officially confirms the NSA developed the flaw that brought
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.480]   down hospitals this weekend.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:53.120]   And the Microsoft post actually calls out NSA and what's the actual quote here?
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.480]   Stock pilot of vulnerabilities by governments.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.040]   And so they're turning this around at kind of a concert to the New York Times op-ed and
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.960]   saying, look, if you guys stockpile this stuff and you get hacking and you get splish to
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.400]   the wild, this is what happens.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.040]   Can you stop doing that and work more with us?
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.240]   So then who's really a fault here?
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.160]   Is it the NSA for uncovering things they can use in its job?
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.840]   Is it Microsoft or not supporting software in perpetuity?
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.720]   Is it Times op-ed columns for being all very old, technologically illiterate people?
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.960]   I mean, I don't know exactly where to drop the blame, but I mean, it's definitely not
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.000]   one person and certainly not a simple answer.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.280]   Oh, also remember, this, this is actually a multi part exploit.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.360]   So it's at least two discrete parts.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.280]   The first part is the phishing attack.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.040]   So either attachment or email link that leads to remote code execution.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.320]   Once it was installed, then it did the second part.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.840]   The second part was an exploit of the sombre vulnerability in Microsoft Windows networking.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.040]   So that's the part that was developed by the NSA.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.880]   That's the part that allows it to move laterally.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.520]   In the past, when you had a phishing attack, you'd affect one computer.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.240]   Maybe the computer that that was authorized to connect to, but this one will actively
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.760]   search out other vulnerable sombre installations in any given network.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760]   I'm dumb.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.120]   Can you explain what move laterally means in this context?
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   Okay.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.920]   So once you get past the firewall, you are, you are all the systems past that firewall
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.320]   are on the same level.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.520]   And if you can move laterally within that, that means that you've essentially bypassed
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.120]   the firewall for all of those computers.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   I see.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   Okay.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   So there's one firewall for all the cool stuff.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   And once you're down there, you can bounce around to different parties, which is one
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   too.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   Right.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   You affect everything in that network, right?
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.920]   Which is why good enterprise class security divides things in the zone.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.280]   So it's not as a firewall.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.760]   And then we just assume everyone's good.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.360]   A good network will assume everyone's going to do something stupid.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.200]   So you firewall as much inside the network is possible.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.040]   So you baby proof essentially your enterprise tech.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   Right.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   Well, that's pretty reasonable.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.480]   Why didn't why didn't we do that here?
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:48.060]   Well, because think of who got hit the hardest manufacturing and the NHS, neither of which
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.760]   really have comp, I'll say competent, even though that's mean, they don't really mean
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   that.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.220]   If you work there, you are competent, but you don't have the resources, but they don't
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.560]   have a competent IT team.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.540]   So they don't have the ability to put things in zones.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.460]   And even if they did imagine in a hospital, if every time you needed to approve an emergency
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.860]   service, you had to go through five different layers of security.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   People would die.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   People would die.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.860]   Right.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.860]   That's not good or in a manufacturing plan.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.860]   That's not good.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.540]   Someone, as someone enters in the wrong password and suddenly you've shut down the assembly
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.540]   floor.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.540]   Okay.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.020]   So we do that.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.300]   So there are this, I think this is the story that I like.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.100]   There's a story of inertia here.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.580]   We do not want to under any circumstance change the way that we work.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.620]   We want the tool to change, but the tool can't change because what they attacked here was
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.620]   human nature.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.100]   It's always fishing.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   I don't know.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.380]   When she, when she, can we just go ahead and replace all the humans with some better
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.500]   ones and then solve the problem.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.860]   Google's working on that.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   That was Peter Teal.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.020]   No, my wife works in the hospital.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   We can't know.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.020]   She gets, may pay a lot of money.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.020]   I don't, I don't want her replaced by her.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.340]   I mean, my, my girlfriend's a doctor.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.940]   So like, I'm saying, but all right.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.020]   See, all I know is if we're going to be replacing healthcare workers, can we replace them with
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.020]   Filipino artificial intelligence because they work the best?
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.260]   I don't know how to comment on that, not getting in trouble somehow.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.220]   I think anything I say to that will get me in trouble.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.660]   So I'm just waiting for you so I can yell racist.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.380]   See exactly what I'm not saying to think.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   Say something.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.980]   Now, yeah, it's cute.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.700]   Here's the thing.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.700]   We're in the second wave.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.340]   This is by far from over because tomorrow millions of Americans go back to the workplaces.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.140]   They're going to be on computers that have been untouched for three days and they are
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.460]   going to log into systems that might have already been compromised or they're going
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.500]   to be going through their huge email inbox and go, I'm going to click everything I see.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.220]   So this is going to spread.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.340]   And if it's the second variant, which it probably is now, there is no kill switch.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.940]   So we're going to be in for a really great ride.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.460]   This is going to be a great week.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.460]   I'm not traveling.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:52.860]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure none of the airports have promised.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.660]   I'm sure they've all updated their systems.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.580]   I think I'm going to get a good idea.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.940]   I have to fly this week.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.380]   I have not to make this up me or anything.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.740]   I told you you should have drove.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.740]   No one listens to Robbie.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:08.060]   I got back from Malta on Friday and I have to leave for Europe again tomorrow afternoon.
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.860]   So that's tough.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.660]   Yeah, I'll just say it was a security thing.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.260]   Yeah, that sounds good.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.260]   Okay.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.740]   All right, we're going to get back to this.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:23.300]   We've got to move on because, yes, the WannaCry is pretty devastating, but I don't think the
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.340]   tech people would say that this was something that caught us by surprise.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.020]   We knew something like this was going to happen at some point, right?
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   I mean, oh, yeah.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   Yeah, of course.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.340]   Yeah, that's it's a given.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.700]   It's like the inevitable earthquake of California.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.700]   It's like the inevitable big one.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.620]   We knew this was coming.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.980]   We know that tons and tons of legacy systems are out there.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.180]   We know that some IT departments are not as good as others.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.860]   It's yeah, and we know that everyone's going to click on those phishing emails.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.140]   I actually I like to do them.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:59.180]   I have systems in my lab that are virtualized specifically so that I can I get to be careful.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.220]   Do you hear about the one that jumps out of virtuals?
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.940]   Yes, yes.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.860]   But even the machine that the virtual machines are hosted on that also gets nuke every time.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860]   Okay.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   It's an automatic process for me.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.620]   I basically hit a red button and everything goes back to the way it was.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.500]   Or a much better nerd than I am.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.140]   Oh, it's just I get a little clapping a whole lot more gear.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.540]   I have no excuse there.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.740]   The church provides gear for me.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740]   Whoa.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.980]   Actually, the church gave me no gear.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   I'm just saying.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.380]   Catholics are really big in the gear.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.220]   Well, folks, speaking of gear, this episode of tweet is brought to you by the Ring Video
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.220]   Doorbell.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.500]   Now, I know that you've seen this.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.460]   We've had this on so many shows on the Twit TV Network.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   Yes.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.340]   It's a doorbell that replaces the device you currently have on your home.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.940]   Yes, it includes everything that you need to be up and running, including the doorbell
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.060]   itself, the adapter plate, all the little tools to have it up and running in just a
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060]   few minutes.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.300]   In fact, I bought this kit before Ring was a sponsor of the network for my father who
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   lives in Las Vegas.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.500]   He was able to install it in about four minutes and had it up and running and I was connected.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.940]   It was very impressive, but it's more than just an electronic do that.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   It's more than just something that you can hang outside so people know that you're geeky.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:13.460]   This is a security device and a security ecosystem that is paralleled by none.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.580]   Today over a million people use the amazing Ring Video Doorbell to help protect their homes
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.580]   because Ring knows home security.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.100]   They know that it begins at the front door and it doesn't end there.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.180]   They're not just providing you a technical solution.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:30.220]   They're giving a solution that kind of takes into account a little bit of human nature.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.100]   That's why they're extending that same level of security that they provided in the Ring
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.900]   Video Doorbell to the rest of your home with the Ring Floodlight Cam.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.220]   Now just like Ring's Video Doorbell, their new Floodlight Cam is a motion activated camera
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.780]   and floodlight that connects to your phone.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.180]   It's got HD video and 2A audio so it lets you know the moment anyone steps on your property
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.940]   and actually lets you have a 2A conversation with them.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.900]   You can see and speak to those visitors even set off alarms right from your phone no matter
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.820]   where you are in the world.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.140]   With Ring's Floodlight Cam, when things go bump in the night, you can bump back and immediately
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.140]   know what it is.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.780]   Whether you're home or away, the Floodlight Cam lets you keep an eye on your home and Floodlight
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.700]   Cam's offer the ultimate at home security.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.460]   With high visibility floodlights, a powerful HD camera that puts security in your hands.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.340]   It was named the Wall Street Journal's Best of CES 2017.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.660]   I trust my parents with the Ring ecosystem.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.260]   They've got a Ring Video Doorbell on the front door.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.420]   We've got a Floodlight Cam in the back.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.140]   What that allows me to do is even when my parents are not home, I know if someone's coming
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.780]   up to the front door and peeking through the window or someone's trying the door in the
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.180]   back, saying if maybe it's a jar.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.380]   It's that that tells me that my parents are secure because I know if someone's scoping
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:46.180]   out their place, it gives me a peace of mind and it lets me know that my parents are protected.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.300]   So here's what we want you to do.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.820]   We want you to be always home.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.860]   And with Ring, you can do that.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:58.420]   Save up to $150 off a Ring of Security Kit when you go to Ring.com/twit.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.220]   That's Ring.com/twit.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   And we thank Ring for their support of this week in tech.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.940]   All right, let's move on because I'm done with fishing and with worms.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.980]   I want to talk about something happy, shiny and new, specifically the Amazon Echo.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.740]   Oh, I'm sorry, the Amazon Echo Show.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:23.420]   By the way, disclaimer here, gentlemen, lady, we do not say the Amazon Voice Assistant trigger
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.820]   word.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.420]   You can say either Amazon Voice Assistant or Echo, but don't say that other word because
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.060]   Alex, what if we just call it like, ow.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.860]   Is that close enough?
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.940]   That actually might trigger on some system because you have to remember, people listen
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.180]   to this show on their Amazon devices.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.820]   And if we say it, the show interrupts itself, which is awesome.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.140]   I've decided I don't like them.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.140]   So now I kind of want to troll all the others.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.140]   I just want to respect for the Amazon.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   No, you want to say it.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.180]   I will do some of them change into computer or to Amazon.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.580]   Yes, but we have no control over that.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.580]   Okay.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.980]   But if you say it, the editors have to spend extra time editing things out.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   Okay.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   Do we like editors?
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.980]   We do.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.980]   They're the editors of the editors.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   I love the editors.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.980]   In general, they're the editors.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.780]   They're the hardest working people to quit.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.580]   They're the only working people to quit.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.780]   Oh, come on.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.140]   Are you walked into that one?
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   It's true.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.460]   Can we even say Wilhelm's name or?
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   No, no.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.460]   It's my first name.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.460]   It's close enough.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.460]   It's close enough.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.940]   If you say my full name with the ander at the end, it would probably be even closer.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   Yep.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.740]   So, I am nameless.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.740]   Okay.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.500]   So just, you know, those are the ground rules.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.260]   Well, let's talk about the new Amazon Echo show.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.700]   So we're talking about a seven inch touchscreen front facing camera, Mike, our rear facing
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.700]   eight mic array.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.100]   So you get that wonderful conference phone technology.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:52.060]   It's powered by an Intel Atom X5 Z8350, WiFi 802 11 ABGN.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.300]   That's both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz connected.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   Plus Bluetooth.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.180]   It's probably going to be some Amazon variant of Bluetooth like they use on their fire
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.180]   tablets.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.180]   It works with all current Amazon voice assistant skills.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.580]   And it's going to be available on June 28th for 230.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.940]   Of course, you get $100 off if you buy a two pack.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.820]   If you buy it, if you're right now, it is so ugly.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.820]   It is.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.820]   It is.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.820]   It is.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.580]   You know, it looks like the 20th anniversary Mac.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.580]   That was on a.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.580]   No, you know what?
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.580]   It really looks like it looks like a chubby.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.580]   It looks like a chubby.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.580]   It looks like a chubby.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   It looks like a chubby.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   It's like a chubby.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   It's just a thing that.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.580]   I have a better one.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   You know what?
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.620]   It reminds me of almost exactly like the three, the three, calm Audrey.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.620]   Kind of.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.620]   Yes, it kind of looks like Audrey.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   Yes, it does.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.020]   It looks a little bit like the Audrey, a little bit like a chubby, a little bit like Sony's
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.900]   variant of the chubby, which was called the dash.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.500]   No, it is so ugly.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   I do not.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.940]   When the leaks first appeared, which I have a feeling is what forced them to go forward
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   with the announcement.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.540]   But when the leaks appeared last week, I was like, there's no way this is real.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.540]   And then every week was like, yeah, here's your quality.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.540]   Here's your product photo.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.620]   And I was like, okay, so this is what this looks like.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.620]   Why?
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.620]   Why Amazon?
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.620]   Why?
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.620]   I honestly.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.620]   That's the biggest question.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.540]   Well, the fire phone was attractive for, I mean, okay, it wasn't attractive.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.620]   It looks like any other phone.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.100]   Like the echo and the echo dot look fairly good.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.700]   And I even think that the look, the really creepy, you know, camera fear bedroom that
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.780]   I kind of want.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.780]   I do.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.780]   I kind of want to.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.780]   I'm terrible.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   I'm the worst.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.780]   And the worst have it first.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.780]   I want the look.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.820]   But at least those have some sense of design, I suppose.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.140]   Especially when you get the dots or the echo in white, I think they're nice looking.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.820]   This especially in white is just terrible.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.900]   This is just, this is one of the ugliest gadgets I've seen in a really long time.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.780]   And I don't understand how Amazon.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.780]   It's just a flat thing.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   It is.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:50.700]   It's like the worst digital photo frames that are out there.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.860]   So you remember when for like six months, everyone was buying those digital photo frames
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   for their parents?
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   Yes.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   Yes.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   It's one of those.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   It happens to have a speaker.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.340]   It looks like someone 3D printed something that all the parts would fit into.
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.340]   Right.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.860]   And it gave it to the styling team and the styling team's like, oh no, which is good
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   with that.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   That's brutal.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.300]   But, but, but, okay, but yes, it's brutal.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:16.780]   But, but man whose name I can't say because we don't want to trigger the Amazon keyword.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.900]   It's accurate because this is designed for your home.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.140]   Like, you know, the, the, the echo and the echo dot are kind of designed for bedroom or
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.140]   kitchen.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.220]   This is, they're literally being like, oh, put this, you know, and put this everywhere.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.220]   Make this a centerpiece because you're going to use this to use the Amazon version of FaceTime
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.660]   that no one is actually going to use.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.700]   And you're going to use this to watch Netflix, even though I bet the lag is significant on
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.180]   that Adam processor.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.140]   And you're going to use this to, I don't know, give visualizations for your music,
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   I suppose.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.980]   Which all sounds great.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.180]   That means like, that makes the screen the center point.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.100]   So like, they really want people to show this off.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.900]   Which makes to me, which makes the, makes the ugliness factor that much more egregious.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.900]   That's what kills it.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.300]   It's, this is the, the, the whole Amazon voice assistant ecosystem is a hands-free system.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.340]   The second you tack a screen on, it's no longer hands free.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   It's, you can't roam.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.180]   You need to be able to see the screen.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.140]   Can you imagine anyone wanting to watch content on a seven inch touchscreen that's in the
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.140]   middle of the, that's tilted up.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:19.140]   That's tilted up.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.140]   What's awesome is it's tilted up.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.660]   And so you get that camera angle that everyone loves that like, your chin.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.900]   So you kind of look like you're like a monster.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.900]   That's awesome.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.300]   If you really want this, buy yourself a $50 Amazon fire towel that 3D print a stand.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   And there you go.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.380]   It's a show and Twitter will print the stand for you.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.380]   And we will 3D print the stand.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.580]   We'll make it look like the show.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.580]   It's not.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.740]   So people in the chat are comparing this to the, the, the iMac, you know, that was,
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.100]   that they had it was like on the stand.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.100]   I think that is mean.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.060]   I think that was the best looking iMac that was ever created.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.540]   The one that, the G4 iMac that was like on the, the Lancers.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.740]   This is way worse than this.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.740]   That was a beautiful design.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   That was distinctive.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.660]   This is just sort of, yeah.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.300]   At least, at least the echo, it had that cool look.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.980]   It's like, oh, I've never seen anything like this.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   Okay.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.820]   And the dots like unobtrusive is just nice little pop.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.620]   You can put it anywhere in your house.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.620]   You can put it anywhere.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.860]   And as you guys were saying, the whole point is that it is voice controlled, whereas this
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.900]   is voice controlled, but yet they want you to stare at it.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.180]   They want it to be the center point.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.580]   I cannot imagine.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.020]   And I'm somebody who in theory would, would like an object like this, even though I would
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.100]   probably never use the screen.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.100]   I'm the sort of person.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.820]   Like I said, I'm probably going to buy the look because I'm a dumb person.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.340]   And I, I, I, I'm an idiot.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.780]   And I'm like, oh, I, I don't have a full-length mirror.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.660]   This would be great just invite Amazon into my home to have photos of me everywhere.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.780]   And like, I, I'm that person who literally is like buying into that argument.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.420]   And even I'm looking at this and I'm like, there's no way I'm putting this in my house.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.580]   There's no way.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.260]   I have an Amazon parent.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.980]   So someone who works for Amazon is a parent at the school that I live at.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.180]   And she was trying to explain to me all the things, the reasons why I would like this.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:06.420]   And her primary thing was it works with all of the Amazon voice assistant skills.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.620]   And I was like, but I can already use those with my echo.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.220]   And she goes, well, this is for the people who don't have an echo.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.220]   So they have them buy an echo.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   I know.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220]   Exactly.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   So they didn't buy a Volkswagen.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   I'll sell them a Porsche.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.220]   That'd be fantastic.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   No, no.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Of course it's pretty.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   The thing is this, this is a lot of hate.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.420]   Is there, is there a good use case for having the screen?
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   Yes, there is.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   For the NSA into your house more easily.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.620]   Yeah, that's every computer you own.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.620]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.380]   This is like, like, I didn't buy a, I could say echo, right?
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   Yes.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.980]   I didn't buy an echo or a dot because it felt like a huge privacy violation.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.700]   I mean, to Christina's point about the show, that's a whole different kind of kind of
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   the fish.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:48.180]   But I mean, this is adding even more capabilities into letting people into my house and to collect
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   data.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.620]   And frankly, no, it does not feel good to me.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.620]   I'm actually with you.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.580]   I have an echo.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.540]   It is unplugged.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.100]   I only plug it in whenever I'm doing a project that requires it.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.860]   I have the voices assistant on my phone turned off by default.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:12.220]   I have a Cortana on my Windows 10 computer turned off by default just because I don't
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.420]   like data leaving my network.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.420]   Sure.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.420]   That's a methane.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.380]   It's probably stupid paranoid, but it's a methane.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.020]   No, no, that's, that's completely not paranoid.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.700]   But I am, you know what I'm surprised about?
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.900]   The amount of like hackers and security researchers that I know that I meet at Defcon
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.300]   that I hang out with that have Amazon echo and dots.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   They love those things.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   They love that.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.300]   They're so funny.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.340]   They, they, they build the Amazon skills for them and they're like, oh, it's so awesome.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.740]   Look at all this stuff I'm playing with.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.180]   And, and, and that makes me feel like better about my own poor decisions to let these products
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.500]   into my house because objectively I know that you're both right.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.020]   I'm like, I should never have this.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.020]   I should turn all this off.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.820]   I have three of them.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.060]   And then I'm, and then I'm like, I really like to listen to Spotify with my voice.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.820]   I really like to control Spotify with my voice.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.180]   I really like to get my news updates.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.500]   I like to be able to listen to Twitch, you know, or whatever.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.220]   Like, I like that convenience and I'm willing to give some of that up.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.620]   But this, what's interesting to me too is, you know, is when we talk about those skills,
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.380]   they are designed for voice.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:16.260]   And obviously with the fire TV, there is a visual interface for some of these things.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.860]   And so there's precedent for that.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:23.580]   But most of the people who are creating skills are doing it again without the need for a
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.580]   screen.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:29.540]   So I don't see the unless, unless, unless, you know, they can really make the developer
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.140]   play to say, oh, you should really be developing screen based responses, which is a very different
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.140]   approach to doing things.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.700]   I don't even know how good the experience is going to be.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.780]   And honestly, if you did want that visual experience, wouldn't it be better to just
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.460]   have your nice attractive TV that's already in your home and have your fire TV stick,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   like connected to that?
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.740]   I mean, okay, you don't get the camera for the voice calls, but let's be honest.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.700]   Even the biggest Amazon diehards are never going to use the Amazon voice service because
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.220]   you're never going to be able to convince your family members to like open the Amazon
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:07.020]   app and make a video call when they could just FaceTime or use, you know, do or whatever
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.260]   or Skype or anything else.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.300]   Like, we're already pretty invested in our video systems.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.780]   The only thing we'll add to that is FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts, and all the other
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.300]   consumer grade video-conversing solutions are bad.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.980]   And so this one actually has a high fidelity and a reliable connection that I can use across
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.260]   both oceans and continents.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.060]   I will buy one just for that.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.580]   No, it's still going to be bad.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   The thing is probably won't be good on the app.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.580]   I was going to say, but do you believe that actually is going to be the case because I
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   certainly don't.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.220]   I was trying to find some nice thing to possibly shoot for on this conversation.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.180]   Well, it's Christina brought up.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.540]   It's someone who might have a use case for that screen.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.620]   Well, if you're going to do that, you can do that from the Amazon voice assistant app.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.620]   Right.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.620]   On your phone, which is a nicer screen and it's already with you.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.620]   So there's no use.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.620]   It's weird.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.620]   It's a very strange placement.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.620]   It doesn't make any sense for you.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.620]   So is it going to fluff?
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.020]   Are we saying that?
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.540]   I think if it were more attractive, they might be able to convince people to do it just because
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.980]   of how successful the other echoes have been.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.620]   I would even be open to buying one for my mom if it were more attractive.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.540]   I would have probably considered it as a Mother's Day gift or something.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.740]   Honestly, I'm like, "Okay, hey, we'll get this in a month."
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.700]   But instead, I could never put that in my mom's house.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.700]   I love my mom.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.700]   I don't want to do that to my mother.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   That's just mean.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   It's like your mom made you mad.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.940]   You're like, "Oh, you guess what you get?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.940]   Boom."
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.780]   So this will be the Amazon lump of coal.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.580]   Is that for shareholders?
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.580]   We'll see.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.580]   Oh, wait.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.580]   Okay.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.940]   Let me inject some positivity in here.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.700]   A lot of people didn't know what to do with the echo.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.500]   When the echo first came out, they were like, "So this will help me shop more?"
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.140]   And it turned out to be a blockbuster product.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.660]   It was not just a blockbuster product.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.500]   It was a new genre inventing product that everyone turned out.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.500]   Three point.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   Three point.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.660]   It was funny, they didn't give out review units for a while on the echo.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.540]   You had to actually buy one and apply to get one.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.060]   And so when I was at Mashable, I actually got one very early.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:09.300]   I was able to do the review when it still only had a couple of skills.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.980]   But even then, I was like, "This is amazing."
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.980]   And you're right.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.620]   I remember when it was first announced, we all were kind of like, "What?
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.620]   What is this?
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.620]   This is..."
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.460]   It was something that the most of the pundits and most of the tech press didn't quite understand
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.540]   and then it came out and it was a good product and they've continued to make it better.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.140]   So yeah, I think you're right.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.340]   For all of mine, I've been the biggest hater on this thing.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.820]   But I will add the caveat that I didn't believe that the echo would be as big as it is and
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.300]   then it came out and I loved it.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.700]   I think that if they could come out with a more attractive version of this, that would
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.420]   be my only thing, honestly.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.420]   Who knows?
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.720]   They might have real potential.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.260]   I think the ecosystem for the echo products is huge.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.820]   I just don't.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.180]   I think the way this one looks is going to automatically make it the way it lists for
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.180]   me.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.220]   Do you think techies will hate it, but consumers will love it?
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.620]   I don't see what the need is for it.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.620]   Really?
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.620]   Yeah, it's ugly.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.540]   Yeah, I don't understand why you had to put a screen on something that worked great.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   I asked thing, name, damn it.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.620]   I asked it something.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.620]   It tells me something.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.260]   I don't have to like do this.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.780]   Like, well, okay, let's just say because it's pointed up and I have it on a table.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.660]   I don't have to do this to look at it.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.340]   Oh, yeah, it's going to be rainy tomorrow.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   It could just tell me it's going to be rainy.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.140]   How often do you use it all the time?
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.540]   Like, can you break like five times a day?
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.540]   At least.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.540]   Really?
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   Yes.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.540]   Yes.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   And you do the same.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   All right.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   Wow.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.780]   When I had it plugged in, essentially all it did was play music for me.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.180]   Because it's a decent speaker.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.180]   It's a great speaker.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.180]   Nice.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.180]   The dot is not.
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.180]   The dot is not.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.540]   The whole point of the dot is to plug it into your speakers.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.180]   You plug it into your speaker exactly.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.180]   Yeah, I didn't know.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.020]   You can use Bluetooth or you can use, you know, the car.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.020]   It was the odd hour.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.660]   It was my on dash for.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.860]   Oh my god, that's so cool.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   It worked.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.580]   It's the new revolutionary dot to go.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.300]   Did you just tether it to your phone?
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   Or?
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.300]   Yes.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.300]   It's amazing.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   Got its internet through my phone.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300]   I had it tied into the audio system.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.020]   I had the array mics in my car.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.060]   And it actually worked reasonably well.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.060]   We become best friends.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.580]   They won't hang out with you all the time and hang out with you all your cool stuff.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.140]   My life is so boring compared to that.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.860]   Well, you have to remember, I have no social life to speak of.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.060]   So you're talking to tech journalism.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.740]   Neither is you on time.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.740]   This is all I do.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.740]   I make stuff.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.740]   This is my lab.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.540]   I mostly lose video games.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   Anyways, good.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.540]   All right.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.220]   But there is one more attachment to this.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:39.140]   This is the fact that Amazon also announced there and I can't say it a word calling.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.140]   It's a new skill that allows hands free.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   I know, right?
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:48.940]   It allows for hands free sending and receiving of calls to anyone with an echo or the Amazon
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.940]   voice assistant app.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   So it will work on phones.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.420]   It will work on all the echoes.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.020]   It will work, of course, on the new show and on the look.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.140]   Now paired with a show, you can also make video calls with this.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.700]   It's interesting, right?
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.300]   I mean, free is good.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.860]   It will work on everything you already have.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.180]   Is this a good thing?
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.300]   The video calls doesn't make sense because I can make a video call with this.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   True.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.980]   I can walk around the house.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.980]   Look at this.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   Look at that.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:15.980]   I'm over here.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.220]   I'm over there as opposed to staring down at the thing on a.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.100]   Hi, right here.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   What's going on?
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   Oh, just stuff.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   You can't see it right now.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.500]   And Robbie is very tall.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.300]   If you didn't know this, he is the tallest tech journalist of all time.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.380]   No, Casey's taller name.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.660]   He's the second tallest tech journalist of all time.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.660]   There's a record.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.900]   It's true.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:41.260]   And well, we use FaceTime in my household, but it's mostly between my brother and my
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.940]   mother because she wants to see the grandchildren.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:49.500]   I can't see her tilting the show down so that no, that's kind of weird.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.740]   I mean, do you recall all the times they come out with like the Windows 7 PC for the
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.260]   kitchen, the Windows 8 PC for the kitchen, the Windows Vista PC for the kitchen?
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.340]   They're like, it's going to be touch.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.020]   You can wave and do all this cool stuff.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.020]   It'll be great.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   It'll be right there.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.020]   You can do best of bees.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.020]   And no one bought them.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   That was the Audrey.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.020]   The Audrey was the system for the kitchen.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   Okay.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   To me, this is a new shot.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.020]   It's interesting to go for it.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   No, she's.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   It's a pretty small cheat.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.020]   That's it.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   It has that advantage.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.500]   It is a low price item, at least.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.140]   I would say that that's probably it's best quality is that this is very inexpensive for
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.940]   what it's ostensibly offering.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:27.740]   But again, I kind of, I wonder, like, wouldn't people be better off getting a fire tablet?
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.740]   You know?
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.740]   And it's one quote to something.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.420]   Less than one quote to the price.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.420]   Why wouldn't you just do that?
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.740]   Put it on a stand and now you can walk around with it.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.740]   Put it on a stand.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.740]   Now you can walk around.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.220]   You can do all the same stuff with it.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.820]   You might not be always listening the same way that this device would be.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.060]   But like you said, it'd be portable.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   You can walk around with it.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.820]   You can actually talk with it, all that stuff.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.300]   And people, I mean, look, people do love to put their tablets in the kitchen.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.060]   It's a very popular place for people to put tablets.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.060]   I just don't, I don't know.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.820]   I don't understand this product.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.060]   Like people I see you put tablet, they tend to move like you would a cookbook.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060]   Exactly.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060]   I'm going to put it there.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.380]   I'm going to put it here and when put it there and you get like, you know, a nice cheap
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.860]   Google or Android tablet.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.660]   And you just, I think they should, they should have done a bit more user study because if
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.900]   they wanted to make something with a screen that would be an indispensable item, it would
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:21.220]   have been the Amazon Echo paper, installable in the bathroom with a seven inch screen and
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   right below, by below it is the, that's a good, yes.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:29.860]   And that's the old screens and that's really the only place where you're not your, your
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.420]   stationary looking at it.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   I'm out of toilet paper.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   You hit the dash button.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.420]   Yeah, that's perfect.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   Amazon, you're welcome.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   And you're stationary.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.820]   So you don't need to move it when you're in the bathroom.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.820]   That's where you should put this.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.900]   You can put this in the bathroom.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.660]   Happy Brothers Day, mom.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.900]   You're making toilet jokes.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.500]   You have, it can't really tweet from it.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.700]   So you can't tweet from a candle.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   From a Kindle?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   Oh, you can.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.700]   But that, it wouldn't have a, it doesn't have a keyboard.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.700]   I see your point.
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   You have to show.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   You really do toilet tweets.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   Is that actually a thing?
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.700]   Yes.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.700]   That's definitely wrong.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.180]   It is like 90% of my tweets are from the toilet.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.180]   It's true.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.180]   I want to know that.
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.180]   That's my tweeting.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.100]   I said a big meal.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   Okay, on that.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.620]   I think we're going to be moving away from that.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.380]   But actually, Christina, we're going to be talking to you for the next one because this
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.540]   is something that's going to be in your world.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:24.060]   Amazon wasn't the only one who released interesting news about voice assistants this
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.060]   past week.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.900]   We're going to have to talk about Microsoft's effort.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:31.380]   But before we get there, let's take another quick break to thank another sponsor of this
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.860]   week in tech.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.180]   Now, hey, you guys lose things, right?
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.780]   Because Christina, have you ever lost something that's shiny?
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.780]   So many things.
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.780]   Right?
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   So many times.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   It's too easy.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.900]   I say it's easier now because so many high value items are so small and designed to be
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.620]   so portable that it's easy not just to walk away from them, but it's easy for them to
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.180]   walk away from you.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.180]   Recently?
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.180]   Yeah?
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.180]   Phone?
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.180]   Keys?
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.180]   Bag?
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.180]   Pet?
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.980]   It was a device that we could use that we could attach to our most treasured technology
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.180]   possessions that would allow us to make sure that we always knew where they were, that
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.940]   would allow us to find out down to the meter where they might be located.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.980]   Well, folks, that exists.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.900]   It's called the tracker.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.220]   The tracker is a coin size device that you can attach to anything you find valuable to
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.060]   your keys, to your phone, to your computer bag.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.860]   And yeah, even to your pets.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:28.420]   And it allows you to link it up to your phone so that you can, with a single app, find out
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.140]   exactly where it exists, where it is, where it's going.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:35.380]   Now, tracker is possibly the best, the easiest way to track your things because it uses
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.660]   a lithium battery that lasts for about a year.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.740]   So you're not going to be constantly changing out the battery on this thing.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.060]   It's good to go.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.940]   Not only can you pair a tracker, you can pair up to 10 of them with your phone and get
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.180]   things like separation alerts.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:50.580]   So as you're walking away from your bag in the coffee shop, you get a little notification
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   on your phone saying, "Hey, are you sure you want to be moving away because I'm almost
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.820]   out of range?"
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.260]   You can even do reverse tracking.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.020]   You can push a button on your tracker and it will make your phone ring even if it's set
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.020]   to silent.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.380]   I mean, how good would that be?
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.780]   If you know where your keys are, but you can't find your phone, push the button, listen
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.940]   for the tone.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.100]   There you go.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.620]   Now, with the tracker, you never have to worry about losing your things again.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.980]   The new tracker Bravo is that coin-sized device and it's constructed with anodized
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.980]   aluminum.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.140]   So it's the thinnest, most durable tracking device ever.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.860]   Once you pair it, you can find out where all your items are.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.860]   And here's what I really love.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:30.380]   It uses something that they're calling mesh GPS or crowd GPS.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.020]   It allows you to find out where device is even if it's gone beyond the range of your
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.940]   Bluetooth transmitter and receiver.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:41.700]   The way it does that is as long as your tracker is within range of another tracker user, they
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.540]   can still get the beacon and you can still get the notification.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.260]   That means that if your phone has wandered across the world and it is now somewhere in
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:53.500]   India, you can still push that button and find out on what street it's located.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   It's that cool.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.540]   In fact, a while ago for one of my other shows, KnowHow, I had a gig bag that I left in our
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.660]   garage at the high school and unfortunately, someone opened up the garage during one of
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.020]   our open campus days.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.260]   Someone had wandered into the garage, took my gig bag and left with some prototype devices.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.420]   It really bummed me out.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.540]   But what really ticked me off was when my audience said, "Wait a minute.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.140]   You've had the tracker on your network for a year.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.620]   Why don't you have one on your bag?"
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.580]   And yeah, that was one of those smack my head moments.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:25.540]   With over 4.5 million devices, SHIP Tracker has the largest crowd GPS network in the world.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.100]   So again, you're always going to be able to find your item even if it's wandered away
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.180]   from you by miles, by states, by countries.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.380]   And the distance indicator on the tracker app will show you if you're getting closer
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.660]   or further away from your item.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.500]   So there's a little bit of detection finding skill involved.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.020]   And with a 30-day money back guarantee, there's no reason not to give it a try.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:48.020]   Folks, are you tired of losing your stuff?
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.420]   Well, you can stop losing your stuff today.

[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.620]   And we thank Tracker for the support of this week in tech.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:14.300]   All right, let's move on to a lesser known voice assistant, but I think one that is
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.540]   important nonetheless, that's Cortana.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.020]   Of course, Cortana is built into every Windows 10 device.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.060]   It's in the Xbox One.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.500]   And now Microsoft wants to make it a standalone device.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.060]   They don't want it to be tied to the PC.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.580]   They don't want it to be tied to your TV.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:32.660]   They want it to be something like what Google and Amazon have with their respective voice
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:37.100]   assistants at Build, which was this last week.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.740]   It was clear that Microsoft wants to go after this market.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.420]   They see it as lucrative.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:45.900]   And I think they saw what most tech journalists saw at CES.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.380]   Everything is Amazon.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.660]   Everything had an Amazon integration.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:54.100]   I mean, the refrigerators, washers, dryers, TVs, they're all realizing why build my own
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.460]   thing when I can use Amazon's.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.220]   And Microsoft wants some of that.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.220]   You all saw that.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   How many of you went to CES?
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.220]   Yeah, no.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:05.020]   It's ridiculous how big the echo has gotten.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020]   So quick to...
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.020]   I'm always...
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.980]   And my thought is, what took Microsoft so long?
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.980]   And apparently, Apple's working on the same thing, but come on, guys.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   Gift the program.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.180]   Well, I mean, Siri's been out the longest of all these things.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   And it's the worst of all of you.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.140]   And I said that Apple has different privacy rules and how they segment data.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.220]   And so I don't mean that in a way to cast dispersions.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:29.080]   But I mean, Cortana is somewhere in the middle of my experience between a word and then
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   Siri at the bottom.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.080]   Is that...
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   Is that...
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   Yeah, that's the worst of all.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.080]   That's what I'm trying, guys.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   I don't want to trigger anyone by accident.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.780]   But Cortana is fine.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.620]   I have it on Windows 10.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:39.740]   But I've never thought of myself.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.980]   I really have to have this in more devices.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.940]   But then again, I'm the guy without a dot or an echo.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.620]   So maybe I'm the weird person out here.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:50.500]   And this sounds like a reasonable move, but not one that I'm exactly jumping up and down
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.140]   screaming like, "Yes!"
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.140]   About.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.980]   Christina, do you use Windows 10 at all?
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.980]   Um...
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.460]   Oh, that's probably the wrong question to ask you at this point.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   She has an Xbox.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.460]   I see an Xbox.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.460]   Yeah, I have an Xbox One S.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   There you go.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.460]   You have Cortana.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.460]   Yeah, it does.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.460]   And so...
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.740]   Is your phone in the appointment going to stretch on a little bit longer now?
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.740]   Sorry.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.660]   I'm sorry about that, Christina.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.860]   We'll put that on the back.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.540]   I will be using Windows 10 every day very soon.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.860]   And I'm very excited about it.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:28.860]   You're not a journalist anywhere.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.780]   You don't have to worry about ethics.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.380]   Just say whatever you want now.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.380]   Normal's life.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:37.380]   You are now in the realm of the normals.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.540]   And they have much more freedom.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.820]   But okay, let's talk a little bit about what Microsoft is doing here.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:45.780]   Because they realize that even though technically they have a much larger installed base than
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   Amazon ever will because it's included in Windows 10, which they allow people to get
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.180]   for free.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:57.700]   And just across the 500 million monthly active device number, so a half billion.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:04.940]   And for example, I have about a dozen Windows 10 devices in my lab, all of which have Cortana
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.900]   turned off.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.060]   And I don't think I'm alone in that.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.660]   I think a lot of people see that, hi, I'm Cortana.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.100]   Come, your voice assistant.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.100]   No, no, go.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.580]   And they're like, no, no, I don't want to.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.380]   I mean, when I've reviewed Windows laptops, I certainly usually will use Cortana more than
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:24.820]   I ever used, say Siri on the Mac because Siri on the Mac is garbage.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.780]   I mean, it's superfluous.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.780]   There's really not a point to it.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   Where is at least Cortana?
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.340]   You can get some interesting results and do some things.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.700]   But it's, I don't know.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.700]   Maybe I'm wrong in this.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.980]   Where I understand Siri and Google Assistant on phones and how that can be useful, I think
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.780]   really where the voice assistant stuff has become the most useful.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:50.300]   This is what Amazon nailed was realizing that it is the secondary devices in the home
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.660]   that are these speaker types of things.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.140]   That's really where it becomes interesting.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.660]   And that's why at CES, we saw so many integrations.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:03.060]   And that's why Microsoft is obviously so interested in expanding Cortana into this space
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:08.220]   because I think that at least for me, the way I use stuff, I mean, I might use Siri
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:15.140]   to set an alarm on my phone and I might use maybe Cortana for a similar purpose to connect
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:20.700]   to a network or to do some sort of quick search if it's just faster.
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.900]   But in general, I don't even think to do that.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:29.500]   I tend to instead get the most value out of those sorts of voice assistants if it's set
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:35.300]   an alarm or set a timer or play this channel or what's the weather, those sorts of things
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.820]   that are really best suited for a third party device rather than something that's integrated
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.180]   into my computer where I can just Google something or my phone where similarly I can
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:49.020]   just open up a web page and type in and I'm right there.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.180]   And for me, I get it.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.340]   I've played with Cortana.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.340]   It's actually quite good.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.340]   And it gives me interesting analysis, which I don't find from other assistants.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.820]   But the problem has always been I have my keyboard and my mouse.
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:06.140]   If I'm at my computer, I'm always faster than me asking Cortana to do something.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   So why would I ask that?
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.140]   I would still have.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.140]   Every single time.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.420]   So it's a walk away device.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.420]   It's a voice assistant.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.460]   It's like the Echo and that's what they now realize, okay, we have to have that device
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.380]   that proves the utility of Cortana.
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.420]   It's a hands-free device when you're away from the keyboard of the mouse.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.300]   Is this just Echo Envy?
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.660]   Well, no, I actually see this as part of the strategy.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:32.060]   You have to remember Nadella came from Microsoft's web services side.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   That's what I'm.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:38.460]   And he's always been about web services first and part of web services first is leveraging
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.020]   the integrations that Microsoft can offer that no one else can.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.740]   They love using things that they can do that Amazon can't.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.620]   And I think they're betting on two things.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.340]   The first is they're using the PC model of voice assistant.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.300]   So unlike Amazon and Google, they're not building their own thing.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.820]   Well, they will as a reference device.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   They want partners.
[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.820]   Right.
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:58.820]   Right.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.540]   So they brought in HP Intel, Invoke speakers, BMW, Nissan.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   They want their partners to build the devices just like their PCs.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.980]   And I think that gives them the edge as far as penetration.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:15.380]   So you'll see a more varied variety of voice assistants in different circumstances.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.380]   You'll find them in the car.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.380]   You'll find them in the appliances.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.860]   But the second thing, and I think this is their big advantage.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.100]   This is why I would not count them out.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:28.820]   They can offer far more integration than Apple, Google or Amazon.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:32.380]   In the sense that they have your calendar, they have your travel plans, they have your
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.900]   search history, they have your time sheets, they have IoT data.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.860]   If they're tied into your enterprise network, they have your enterprise networking data.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:42.740]   And all of those things, they've already integrated it into Cortana.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:49.940]   Cortana can make some amazing correlations based on your contact sheet and who you're
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   getting email from.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.780]   But yeah, that's a corporate play.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.260]   Google does have my travel plans.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.980]   Google does have my calendar.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.980]   Google does have all this stuff.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.980]   I don't care.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.620]   The average person doesn't care about their time sheets at home.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.740]   Well, it's not bringing up your time sheets, but you'll find Cortana doing something like
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.620]   it will know that according to your time sheet, you've worked this much.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.340]   So you probably need a vacation.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.340]   And it knows that this is when you get paid.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.180]   So these are good times to pitch you on vacations.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.660]   So it's going to try to sell me stuff?
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:23.660]   Not necessarily.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.660]   It depends on your settings.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.660]   I'm not down for that.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.860]   Well, I got a block Cortana.
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.220]   I think I just know that I need a vacation.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.700]   I don't have any.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:36.740]   If I need a robot in my house to tell me, you know, Robbie, you need a vacation.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   Can Cortana have a vacation?
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.060]   I should have known that like weeks ahead of time.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.700]   Robbie, I've noticed you're bleeding out of your eyes.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.860]   It's a good time to stop and wait for a computer to do.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.620]   Punch the wall three times in four days.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.860]   How are you doing today?
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:53.540]   I don't think they're going to be intelligent enough for us digital, not natives per se,
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.540]   but digital constants.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.060]   Like this is where we live all the time to actually improve our lives.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.060]   But then again, I try to think of the use case for like my parents, you know, like they're
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.260]   less digitally centered than we are.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.380]   So perhaps this would be a good extension of, you know, modern technology into their
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.060]   more functional lives.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.060]   But I'm with you, dude.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.060]   I can type so much faster than I can tell.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.060]   Like it's not even a question.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:17.180]   I'm kind of down on voice assistance for myself in general, just for that very fact.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.860]   I don't, I don't like talking to things.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.100]   No, I do like talking to people.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.540]   I definitely don't want to talk to devices.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.860]   I like going across the room and that's kind of.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.100]   Oh, oh, it's so close.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.500]   Robbie agreed to do 10 pushups after the show.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.420]   I can't do 10 pushups.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.980]   There is no way I would agree to that.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.860]   I might be able to pull off like a third of a pushup.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.980]   I'll pay you $100 to do 10 pushups.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.980]   What?
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980]   Wow.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   Robbie will do it.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   I still don't think I could do 10 pushups.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   That's a sad thing.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.980]   I would like a $100.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.660]   No, we talk about real pushups or like just kind of hover a little bit.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.740]   Well, for you, half pushups for Robbie, full deal.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.300]   I don't know if I could do 10 pushups.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.300]   That's off.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.300]   I'd yeah.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   I haven't surfed in so long.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:06.420]   Anywho, I mean, I like yelling across the room at my digital assistance and where I can't,
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.460]   where I don't have a keyboard, like at my house, I'm sitting there and I want something
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.620]   to happen or I want a question answered, I can yell it.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.060]   In the car, like when it works well, Siri does not, it works.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.100]   You have a way bigger house than I am because we're on the right level.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.260]   No, I look like a little apartment and I just like, if I want something to happen, I am
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.980]   within arms, within arms reach of the device that we have.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.340]   Yeah, but you have 12 computers like all around you.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.980]   I just assume your house is just every surface has a computer on it.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.340]   Well, I mean, just living building a fantasy.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:39.980]   I have to have a different set of computers for every type of work I do.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:40.980]   They never mix.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.340]   That's, that's a thing with me.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   I'm serious.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.780]   They never have a cooking computer.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:51.180]   No, I have a personal computer, but then like the computers I use for the Vatican work
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.580]   are different than the truth, the computers I use for the Twit work.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.580]   Okay, that's fair.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.100]   Different than the computers I work, I use for my school work.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.100]   That's actually reasonable.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.100]   I can't make a joke about that.
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.100]   It sounds fair.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.500]   It sounded more like you were just like, yeah, this is my computer for how when I order
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.500]   E24.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.940]   I wouldn't like a hoarder joke, then it wouldn't have come out very well.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.780]   No, we have, we have hoarders in my order.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.380]   You have to remember anyone that was lived through the depression has already a natural
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.140]   tendency to be in a hoarder.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.420]   And we have a lot of those.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:25.140]   And whenever they die, we have to clean out their rooms and it's a maze balls.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.500]   There is so much in that sentence.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500]   There is.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.980]   But I want to have time for it, but just give us one example.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:35.300]   What's an amazing thing you found during these post life when I was living in Los Angeles?
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.660]   I lived next to a brother, brother McDermott.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.660]   I love him.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.020]   I have no problem saying his name.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.820]   We were clearing, he was a geologist.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.820]   We were clearing out his workshop.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:49.580]   We found more than $150,000 in uncached checks and bonds that he had just received over
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.740]   over 60 years of a career and just tossed him to a box.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   Oh my goodness.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.740]   We also found an actual moon rock that we returned to NASA who said, how did you get
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   a moon rock?
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.260]   Well, I went to the moon and that's amazing.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.980]   How do you know it's a moon rock?
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   Was it labeled?
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.420]   It had no labeled and sharpie.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.220]   But it was like because he had a lot of really valuable stones in his lab, but then there
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.900]   was one that was under a container.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.100]   I was looking at it going, wait a minute.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.140]   And so I contacted a friend I have at JPL.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.860]   I said, are there any missing moon rocks?
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860]   It goes, actually, there's one.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.620]   I'm like, oh, no, I think I have it.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.260]   If there was one missing moon rock, it was one.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260]   That's a.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.260]   Thank you, sir.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.260]   Thank you, sir.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.260]   Thank you, sir.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.260]   All right.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   All right.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:02.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   I'm going to go to the moon rock.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.260]   Writing checks is like I'm in jail or my friend's out of jail or something.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   How do you pay your rent?
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   It's just direct transfer every month.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.260]   Christine, how do you pay your rent?
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.260]   Yeah, I've literally been a landlord.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:45.260]   What I do is I write all the checks for the year and I put them in envelope because you wouldn't do anything because I hate the idea of writing checks is the worst.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.260]   I just give them an envelope full of checks and I just cash them throughout the year.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:55.260]   I got a checkbook when I opened up my current account which I opened 20 years ago with Wells Fargo.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.260]   The book is currently on check number 17.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.260]   How do you pay your rent?
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:10.260]   I'm going to ask your audience how many of you still use a check on an average monthly basis?
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.260]   No, right?
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.260]   One person.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.260]   Who's paying?
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.260]   So, but it does.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260]   But it works weird.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.260]   So, I have the only landlord that's living in the 90s.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:24.260]   I live in Lake County and there's a couple of companies that just do not accept anything except checks.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.260]   That's the only thing that we can do.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.260]   Yeah, we only take checks.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.260]   I don't think I could live someplace that only took checks.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.260]   That would feel really shady to me.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.260]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.260]   No, I mean, before we've been my landlord.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.260]   This is why I have my checkbook because I have more than I do.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.260]   So, your landlord takes them off, right?
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.260]   I wish I could pay my rent with my credit card and get mad points, but they don't let me.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:54.260]   Well, see, they were going to let us pay by credit card, but then if we did that, we'd have to pay like an extra 5% and I was like, well, no.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.260]   Yeah, for the processing fee or whatever, I was like, screw that.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   That's not happening.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:05.260]   So, for a while, before the landlord was on the note, we would do like a certified check because there'd been a problem at one point.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.260]   That's the worst.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:13.260]   That's even worse.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.260]   You had to go inside the bank.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:18.260]   Think of how much security does not exist that we are so used to when you write a check.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   So, the verification is your signature at the bottom of the check and the amount is determined by the number you write in pen on the top of the check.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   That's it.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.260]   We got to spell it out as well.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.260]   That's in that.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.260]   Well, actually, that's the security.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   That's spelling it out.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:43.260]   That's the thing that hits me the most whenever I do have to write a check, which is my spelling is really bad and thank God for spell check because I'm 17.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.260]   That's SEVEN.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.260]   It's just teen, right?
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.260]   You know what?
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.260]   It's in T3N.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.260]   15.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.260]   How do you spell 15?
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.260]   It's not 5th teen, so it'd be FIFTE.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.260]   I know people who write FIFTE.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.260]   I just give them the extra dollar.
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.260]   It's a 15.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.260]   Just rounded up.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.260]   So, it's an easier number to spell.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.260]   Take it.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   I was like, what is it?
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.260]   What is it going to say though?
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:17.260]   What's so funny is that the technology for scanning checks and the OCR stuff in the apps, you know, like Bank of America's app and the Chase app and things like that is incredibly good even for terrible handwriting.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.260]   So, the few times somebody will send me a check and I'll need to cash it.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:28.260]   You can now cash it with the Bank of America app, so you open up your app and you take a photo of the check and the front side and the back side and they're like, we will deposit this in your account.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.260]   You don't even have to go to the bank anymore.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:39.260]   And it's a similar thing, like if you actually go to the bank now, like to deposit through the ATM, it's like scanning the check and like, you know, doing OCR.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.260]   And it's actually quite good.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.260]   So, that that tech is kind of cool.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:55.260]   But yeah, the 60 years that I lived in New York, I very, very, very rarely ever had to write a check to the point that I don't think I ever updated my checkbook with my New York address.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   So, yeah, when I lived in Atlanta towards the end, I think the only way I ever wrote checks was to my hairdresser and pizza.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.260]   And then, you know, like that was it.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.260]   So, it was like Pizza Hut and like the hair salon, like that was it.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:15.260]   Do you have the checkbooks that have the carbon paper underneath the check so it keeps it going?
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.260]   I still have that.
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.260]   Wow.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.260]   I love that thing.
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.260]   It's awesome.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.260]   What advantages?
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.260]   It's like an email receipt.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260]   It's a receipt.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.260]   Like 2000, basically.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.260]   So, you wrote it, you made a receipt for what you do with the receipt afterwards?
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260]   You just hold on to it.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   No, it stays in the checkbook.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.260]   It's a test.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.260]   It stays in the checkbook.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.260]   But the carbon stays in the checkbook.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.260]   Oh, my mom had that when I was a kid.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   I'm sorry, that came back.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.260]   That came out.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.260]   That's massive.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.260]   I meant the last.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.260]   The last checks I got in like 2006 had those.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.260]   They were like, they were like DC comic checks.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   I had like Superman and Wonder Woman checks.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   They were really cool.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.260]   Actually, I like this checks.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.260]   Money.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.260]   You're talking about Cortana.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.260]   Wow.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.260]   Okay, that's different.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.260]   Venmo, there we go.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.260]   I will say that here's a quick life hack.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.260]   I recently had to donate.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260]   Oh, didn't have to.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.860]   I've donated $10,000 to a project to do something at DEF CON because I want them to build something
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.260]   awesome for the attendees.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.260]   And they let me use PayPal.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:21.460]   The reason why I use PayPal is because I now have $10,000 of spend on my credit card,
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.060]   which goes to my frequent flyer mile.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:27.460]   So if you're looking for a quick way to get to your, what do they call that?
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.940]   Because you have to have a certain spend in order to get mileage now.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.380]   That's a very easy way to do it.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.380]   Just have $10,000.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.980]   Has something to give it to.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.980]   Give it to them.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.980]   Voila.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:42.180]   I mean, even if you don't do that because with the special promotion, $10,000 transfer
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.020]   through PayPal through my credit card cost me $160.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.580]   Okay.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.780]   And that's much less than it would cost if I actually tried to hit that spend.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.300]   So if you're looking to do that on your frequent flyer account, it's actually a decent way
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.300]   to hack it.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.300]   It's a good idea.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   You could pay pal to yourself.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.300]   You actually can.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   So you could pay your rent with your through PayPal.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.300]   Put it on your credit card.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   Ooh.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.540]   Or a frequent flyer mouse.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.540]   But this has been there.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.500]   People are like, no, no, that sounds like so much work.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.500]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   Oh, it took two seconds.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.620]   No, I mean, you don't think about finance that much.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620]   It makes me nervous.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.660]   You would like, that's all you do is think about buying.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.780]   Oh, by the way, $10,000 is the max.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.940]   Because if you do $10,001, they do like a two week long security check just FYI.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:25.940]   Gotcha.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:26.940]   Who welcomes that?
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.020]   How do you know that?
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.020]   It's a Jesuit thing.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.020]   All right.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.660]   Let's move on to something else that is not checks or cantana.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:41.220]   A laptop and this actually hit me because I was flying back from Malta on, when did I
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.260]   get back here on Thursday, Friday, Saturday?
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.300]   I got back over the weekend.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:52.180]   And Delta actually had me check my laptop into my bag because they were afraid that a travel
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.700]   ban was going to take place while I was in route because it was a 31 hour trip.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   And I transferred twice and they were like, well, if it happens and you hit the United
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.780]   States, they're not going to let you carry your laptop through.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.820]   This is something that GHS will be doing.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.300]   They're not exactly sure when they're going to institute it, but they're going to be
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.660]   banning laptops in the cabins of all airlines going from Europe to the United States.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.020]   Obviously they had banned it just from a certain number of countries.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:22.580]   Now it will be any European flight you will not be allowed to carry a laptop in the cabin.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   You got to put in your check on the laptop.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.220]   Do they cover tablets as well?
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.220]   Not yet.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.220]   What about two in ones?
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.420]   Or what about really large tablets?
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.260]   Or what about this, which is about the size of a tablet?
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.340]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.980]   There's literally, it makes zero sense.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:44.460]   Because what is the, I'm not going to tell us what the problem is, but whatever security
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.220]   issue they're concerned of, is could it be an explosive?
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.300]   If you have gone that far to make a computer into explosive, it's going to take you five
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.060]   extra minutes to trigger that with your cell phone that's in your pocket in the cabin.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.620]   Unless you have a Note 7.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.580]   Unless you've got two bombs in one.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.580]   Two too easy.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   All right.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:04.580]   Now, okay.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:08.020]   Now this was brought about by intelligence that they did receive that terrorists were
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.340]   modifying laptops to act as an explosive device.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:16.900]   In fact, an Airbus 320 last year had to make an emergency landing after one of these was
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.020]   set off and it actually blew a hole, a decent sized hole through the fuselage, was able
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.540]   to land.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.820]   But that spooked a lot of people because they knew that they were trying to do it and they
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.420]   had finally figured it out.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.260]   They're not releasing any of the technical details.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:35.380]   But from what I was able to hear on the darker side of the internet was it's a combination
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:41.540]   of a binary explosive and actually using the lithium ion battery that's in the battery
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.020]   because they've realized there's a lot of chemical energy in there.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:49.620]   And if you can have a big enough runaway reaction, it's very energetic.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:54.140]   It does actually explode, especially if you combine it with the binary reagent.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.940]   So this is not security theater then.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940]   This is not security theater.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940]   This is actually so.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.380]   But it kind of still is.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.500]   But the shoe thing is still because remember that guy?
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.380]   The shoe thing is shoe once.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.100]   At one time he was trying to light up a bomb that was in his shoe.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.780]   So now we all have to take our shoes off.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.380]   So the fact that like, okay, we can't take laptops on your computer.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:16.100]   You think the terrorists are still like, well, you know, let's keep doing that laptop
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.100]   thing.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.100]   There's actually a whole thing.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.580]   Yeah, I know they're putting them down here.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.180]   Let's keep putting that laptop thing.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:27.340]   Well, there's there's an XKCD comic about a man arguing with a TSA agent at the gate because
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.180]   the TSA agent won't let him bring his bottle of water.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.460]   He was trying to convince trying to win the argument by saying, but my laptop has way
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.160]   more explosive potential than that bottle of liquid.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.300]   Don't make that argument inside the airport.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.300]   Don't do it.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.300]   No, do not.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.300]   Do not.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.300]   Do not.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.300]   Do not.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.300]   You're sitting in the airport for a long period of time.
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:45.300]   But I want to go with what you were saying.
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.300]   Where do you stop?
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.940]   Because the problem isn't the laptop.
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.940]   There it is.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.660]   The problem is the lithium ion battery.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.820]   And that lithium ion technology exists in your phone.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.820]   It exists in your watch.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   It exists in your tablet.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.940]   It evicts it in any mobile device.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.140]   You're not allowed to check battery packs.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:03.420]   I travel a lot of battery packs because I'm always out in the middle of nowhere in a car
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.500]   or whatever.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.660]   And so I need to be able to charge things all the time.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.300]   So I can't check these like bricks.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.460]   So I bring them on the plane.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:14.940]   I stick them in the room saying there's nothing that would stop someone from doing the same
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.940]   thing with a brick.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:22.420]   And that's by design because they've actually had in 2016 there were 33 incidents of fire.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:23.500]   This was not malicious.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.460]   This was just devices catching on fire.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460]   It happens.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.780]   You pinch a lithium poly pack the wrong way.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.260]   You expose it to oxygen and suddenly it's a runaway pack.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:37.100]   And what the FAA is worried about is that the traditional fire suppressant technology
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   that planes carry do not work against lithium ion packs.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:45.860]   A water extinguisher or a hail unextinguisher will not extinguish the flame.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.260]   And it's not the flame that will affect you.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.980]   It's all the smoke that it's going to release into the cabin.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:56.420]   If it's in the cargo hold, there's no way to get to it.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.220]   So we should just not have electronics anymore?
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.460]   No, I don't like that idea.
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.700]   I'm totally fine with that.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.700]   You know what?
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.700]   Let's go back to being honest.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.700]   Okay, you're not, you're not.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.700]   You're not.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   Robbie.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700]   You're on the halfway there.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.460]   I mean, is there any middle ground here that's functional and safe that allows us to still
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.940]   have entertainment on planes?
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.460]   I read mostly analog.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.060]   So I don't really care too much.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.060]   I sleep.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.380]   Well, that becomes the irony too, right?
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:26.460]   The point is that more and more, the airlines are moving away from putting in in-flight
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.420]   entertainment, like in putting in screens on TV, you know what, in the planes and being
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.620]   like, oh no, just use your iPad.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:38.380]   Just use your tablet and sign onto our app on our network and use, you know, access your
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.380]   server that way.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.260]   Like that's literally becoming one of the ways that they're trying to cut money, you
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.980]   know, on implied entertainment things.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:47.940]   So there's like a certain amount of like business pressure versus like security theater
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.660]   or maybe not security theater, maybe valid concerns like are going to be kind of pushing
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:55.620]   up against one another if they do start to ban more and more types of devices from being
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.700]   carried on because then it's like literally like what are people going to do?
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   All right.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.260]   Yeah, that's, that's, and it doesn't make it again.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.820]   It doesn't make any sense because now you've told everybody, hey, we're not going to let
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   these on anymore.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:15.980]   And again, if you're the kind of person who's already created an explosive out of a computer,
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.340]   you're going to be able to trigger it with this.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.340]   All right.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.220]   Well, I just hope we all don't get, you know, taken down, but I can't imagine I'm going
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.660]   to fly any less because of this.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.220]   I don't think I'm going to impact my behavior at all.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.020]   It's going to be an annoyance that I'll get over.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.620]   I don't use, I can't use my computer on the, on the, on the plane anyway.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   Why not?
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.620]   Because I'm too tall.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.620]   I look like a, like a T-Rex.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.700]   I'm like typing like this.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   I'm never comfortable.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.700]   What are you doing?
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.700]   Are you working?
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   Yeah, I'm right on an article.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.620]   So I just don't, you know, you need, you need one of the tablets, one of the convertibles
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.620]   that actually let you put the screen forward.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.620]   What?
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.620]   You've seen those?
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.620]   Like the Acer R13.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.300]   It's, it's on a pivot.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.340]   So you can actually, you, the screen moves up and it's on, I'll still on the swivel, but
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.100]   you put it here so that the keyboard's actually behind the screen.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.460]   I've seen, I've seen that use on planes.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.620]   It works really, really well.
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:01.620]   That's pretty cool.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.620]   I still don't have a lot of.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.660]   Is that why you don't use a mouse in the office?
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.700]   No, I don't use a mouse because I was starting to get carpal tunnel in my right hand.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:08.700]   So I use a tablet now.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.700]   Okay.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.700]   I mean, use a tablet for like two years.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.700]   Robbie has a very particular work side.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.500]   I thought I was just going to really appreciate it.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.220]   We're like 10 feet apart now.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.700]   Besties at the workplace.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:23.500]   See, this, this actually doesn't affect me that much because I don't use my electronics
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   in the cabin.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.740]   I'm normally sleeping or watching something on the, on the entertainment system.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.860]   So if I have to check everything, the only thing I will miss is my phone.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.340]   I like having my phone because I use it when I'm in between on connection.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.340]   Of course.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:41.860]   But I mean, this, that's actually, it's a big impediment to doing business if you don't
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.420]   have your electronic devices with you.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.620]   If, if they were to say, look, they can't travel in the cabin or in the cargo hole, you
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.620]   have to ship it to yourself.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620]   Oh my gosh.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   Oh God.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.620]   That would be nightmare.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.260]   That's the only way to make these things safe.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.340]   That's my still catch on fire in the cargo hold.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.780]   If they were going to catch on fire.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.780]   That's my nightmare.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.380]   I, I mean, do you have time for where to go up?
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   It's going way back in the history of computing.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.340]   People talked about thin clients in the 90s.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.220]   Once we had broadband everywhere, you weren't going to have to have a computer where you got
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.820]   where you, where you ended up, you could just log into your own instance and go from
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.620]   where your son was working on this back in the day.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.620]   If you remember something.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.620]   Yes.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.620]   Oracle too.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.620]   Exactly.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.420]   And we didn't go that way as, as a world of computing, but maybe if that happens, we'll
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.060]   be forced in that direction really late.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.980]   Much later than we thought it may have ever happened.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:28.740]   But I mean, I cannot imagine not having a computer for more than like, when I get out
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.460]   of the shower, I'm like, give me a computer.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.460]   It's been like fine.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.300]   It's hotel Wi-Fi is the worst.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.620]   The thin client will not work.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.900]   I, I have to use hotel Wi-Fi all the time and I'm like, nope, Wi-Fi.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.420]   And even the Wi-Fi as, you know, depends on where I'm at, it's the worst.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.820]   A thin client will not work.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.220]   Christina, you had something?
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.220]   Right.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   I was just, I was just saying like you're, you're right.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.980]   Like this would just be a nightmare.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.100]   The one, the one positive thing, I mean, obviously having to ship your laptop or the
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.100]   reliant thin clients would be terrible.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.060]   The one positive thing, I guess, I mean, it's not positive for everybody.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:05.460]   But if you can't use the laptop in the cabin, then, you know, people like employers who
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:10.060]   try to basically force you to work on, you know, on, on, on flights, you know, that,
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:14.700]   that's a great excuse to no longer having to, to turn literally every free moment when
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:19.980]   we're not in the office into a, into a working option, you know, because sorry.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.780]   Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't work on the flight guys.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.100]   Can't file those blogs because they won't let me.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.940]   We're going to file the blogs, man.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.940]   Come on.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.720]   Oh, oh, by the way, I, I do want to thank Air Malta because they had the old style planes
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.460]   that still had the ethernet jack.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:38.660]   And you can watch movies over the, in the in-plane network.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.300]   And here's the best part.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:45.140]   It actually copied of copy of the file to my computer before it started playing.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.860]   So now I have more one on the computer.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.860]   Yay.
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:52.780]   So I actually woke up in map where we were talking of where Malta is, because I knew, I knew roughly,
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.900]   but it couldn't actually like point to which bit of the ocean there was the spec.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:56.900]   It's in the mad.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.900]   It's right.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.740]   But I couldn't, I couldn't like, you know, pen, it was the most Bon City during World
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.660]   War II because it's where the British were staging their push into Africa.
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.660]   Right.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.660]   And that actually that place is amazing.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.700]   While we went down into the catacombs, it runs the entire, almost the entire city of
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.900]   Emdina.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.860]   And there was a place where you could, you could pay us fee and you would bring your
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:22.900]   family down into these tiny little concrete bunkers while the city was getting blown apart.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.580]   You had to pay a fee.
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   Yeah, you had to pay a fee.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.060]   So if you were poor, you had to do that.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.060]   That's the late stage capitalism.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.060]   That's them.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.060]   True.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.060]   True.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.060]   All right.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.340]   So, but I mean, that's, it's going to happen.
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:37.420]   So are any of you going to Europe anytime in the near future?
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.620]   I don't think so.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.500]   Yeah, I was going to go in the fall actually.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.820]   So you can have your laptop in the cabin on the way over and you'll have to check it
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:44.820]   in on the way back.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:45.820]   I think the wrong year to stop drinking.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.860]   It's going to be a really boring flight.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.620]   You can still take yourself.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.900]   You can still take your tablet and your battery pack and your phone.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:56.260]   I only use a tablet for traveling.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.420]   It's like a watch movie.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.300]   Christina, do you do your real work on a tablet or do you have stuff on top?
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:07.740]   I think there were press rooms at CES and all the big events and the big craze for a
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.140]   couple of years was everyone working on tablets and now I'm seeing them coming back.
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.140]   They're coming back.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.140]   No, you can't do anything.
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.260]   Like he, like he, same people like Federico from, from Mac Stories, like he has been able
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:23.300]   to make the Mac, the iPad Pro, like his primary computer for years and he has a ridiculously
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.300]   complex setup and like more power to him.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.900]   Federico is a great guy.
[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.260]   Me, absolutely not.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.180]   Like I need an actual computer.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.140]   Like I don't, I don't care if it's running Windows.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.380]   I don't care if it's running, you know, Mac OS.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.700]   It could even be a Chromebook.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:40.900]   I would be, that's harder, but I would prefer a Chromebook to just having been like four
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900]   staff.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:42.900]   Yeah, I got work to do.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.900]   I had time to screw around with a tablet.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.900]   We were at CES and one of those kind of God forsaken hallways that you get stuck in before
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.700]   different keynotes and back at TC, Kyle Russell, before into Andreessen was on the crew and he
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.860]   was sitting there on the floor, which is very common.
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:58.740]   And he had one of those little third party iPad stands in the crappy little keyboard.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.300]   And I just wanted to like give him a hug.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.100]   Like, no, just give you a real computer.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.060]   Why are you trying to run an F1 race and a go card?
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.580]   Like it just doesn't make any sense.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.060]   My favorite is seeing press people who are trying to use the wireless keyboard with a
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.660]   tablet, but they don't have a desk that's on their lap.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.660]   Oh yeah.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.660]   But they're always like in the conference hall.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.660]   It's the 65 and up blogging community.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:20.700]   It's kind of rolling with their glasses down and out here like, well, we're going to
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.700]   log on now.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.700]   God bless those people.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.700]   They're still around.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:25.700]   So let's move on.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:30.140]   I do want to talk about something that I think is important because this is in its nascent
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.620]   stage and we actually do still have a say.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:38.420]   Specifically, Comcast and Charter are going to be moving into a new venture and they've
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:42.940]   decided that it would probably be better in their best interest, of course, if they
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.940]   didn't compete.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.620]   I think maybe consumers should have a say in that.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:50.860]   But before we get there, I do want to take another moment to thank another sponsor this
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.860]   week in tech.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.260]   And thankfully, it's a sponsor that has something that is near and dear to my heart and that
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.980]   is eating healthy.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   Here's the question.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.740]   What do you do when you're hungry, when you're rummaging around and yet the only stuff that
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.860]   you can find is junk food.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   It's bad for you.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   It's chips.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   It's cookies.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   It's ice cream.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.060]   Well, folks, you need to make sure that your house, that your workplace, that your office,
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:16.980]   that your apartment is stocked with good eats with things that can satisfy your desire to
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:22.140]   snack but won't completely destroy your body in 10 to 20 years, which is why I'm happy
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:25.460]   that this week in tech is brought to you by Naturebox.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:29.140]   Now when you rely on your self-control to resist the temptation, you need to make sure
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.180]   that you can be rewarded at some point.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:36.180]   And the way that you reward yourself is making sure that your snacks are hearty and healthy.
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.860]   Naturebox makes snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:43.260]   They've created them with a high quality set of ingredients that are free from artificial
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.300]   colors, flavors, or sweeteners.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.020]   So you can feel great about snacking.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.900]   It's no longer, oh my goodness, I ate a bag of chips.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:56.460]   Oh my goodness, I ate a bag of healthy mini Belgian waffles or sriracha flavored nuts.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:01.820]   My personal favorites are the big island pineapple, the cranberry almond bites, the whole wheat,
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:03.580]   raspberry, figgy bars.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.580]   They taste fantastic.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:08.140]   I know, okay, those may sound a bit health foodish, but they're not.
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.900]   They're just delicious, delicious snacks.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.460]   And they recently made their service even better.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:16.580]   Now you can order as much as you want, as often as you want, and no minimum purchase is
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580]   required.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.860]   So you can cancel any time.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860]   It's simple.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.620]   You just go to naturebox.com and check out their snack catalog.

[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.060]   to snack, you owe it to yourself to try a naturebox.

[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:04.380]   That's naturebox.com/twit or 50% off your first order.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:08.580]   And we thank naturebox for their support of this week in tech.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:11.500]   All right, so back to the tease.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.260]   Comcast and Charter on Monday, they made a joint announcement that they would, and I'm
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:21.500]   going to use a quote here, "explore potential opportunities for operational cooperation
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:25.820]   in the respective wireless businesses to accelerate and enhance each company's ability
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:29.780]   to participate in the national wireless marketplace."
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:32.100]   In non-crap speak, what does that mean?
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:38.500]   It means that what they want to do is they want to license service from Verizon, become
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:42.740]   an MVNO, that's a mobile virtual network operator.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.140]   They're probably going to combine it with features that they will integrate into their
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:53.580]   services so that it gives it some unified communication/enterprisey feel and then resell
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.420]   it to their customers.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:57.180]   But here's the thing.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:59.540]   They've decided that they're not going to compete.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.380]   So going into this venture, they've agreed that if either of them ever want to make another
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.500]   acquisition, let's say Comcast says, "Hey, you know what?
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.100]   We can buy T-Mobile."
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:12.340]   Or let's say Charter says, "There's a local operator that we want to buy."
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.780]   It's in Comcast territory.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.980]   They have to get the permission of the other.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:17.980]   That's not creepy.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.980]   That's not, yeah.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   I mean, I'm a capital.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.780]   Yeah, it's totally cool.
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:22.780]   That's totally.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.980]   Yeah, just expect all your bills to go up is what that means.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.380]   Yeah, whenever two corporations get along, I presume that I'm losing some help.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.380]   Right?
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.380]   Again, I'm a capitalist.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:33.380]   I'm not trying to say I'm opposed to corporate entities doing well, but I mean, this seems
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.020]   very creepy to me.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:38.100]   And it's probably pretty good for Verizon because they have both working off and ever
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.700]   kind of going together.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.980]   But I can't imagine this is going to be good for consumers.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:45.580]   Aside from there will be some modest amount of increased competition in certain areas.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:49.500]   But I mean, this is creepy, dude's probably the word "an else."
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.900]   Yeah, it just, I mean, it smells anti-competitive.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.180]   I mean, it's literally, it's in the wording.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.340]   We're not going to compete against each other.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.060]   I believe that's the definition.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.060]   Yeah, I can read.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:05.700]   It's really interesting because in a different administration, in a different era, like
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:10.620]   this would be the sort of thing that would immediately, I think, trigger intervention
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.060]   from Congress or something to look into this.
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:16.140]   Because this just on its face just smells bad.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.460]   This just doesn't seem OK.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.980]   Do you think Tom Wheeler would have been in favor of this?
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.980]   No.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.820]   Do you think a jeep pie would be in favor of this?
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   Oh, gosh.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.820]   You mean former Verizon employee as you pie?
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.820]   Yes.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.820]   I have not heard that before.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.460]   Also, I will say, though, just credit to pie.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460]   Charming.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   But wrong about everything.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.460]   Yes.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.460]   Charming but wrong.
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.460]   You don't really care how charming he is.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.980]   He's trying to dismantle neutrality and a bunch of other things.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.380]   Oh, no, he's an awful human.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.380]   Charming doesn't really matter to me.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.380]   Oh, gosh.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.380]   What?
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:49.380]   I'm trying to find nice things to share a lot of.
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.380]   He's super cool in the show.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.380]   It's not being negative all the time.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.940]   OK, I will say this, though, about a jeep pie.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.820]   I absolutely, unlike with you, I do not agree with his policies.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.820]   I think he's wrong.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:01.300]   However, he's been very consistent about them.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:05.420]   Unlike of a lot of other people who will flip flop, he, two years ago, he told everyone
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:06.900]   his stand on net neutrality.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.220]   And he's stayed by it.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.020]   I think his defense of it is absolutely indefensible.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.220]   But at least he stayed with it.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.700]   So you're saying we should give him more points because he hasn't done any self-education whatsoever
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:18.860]   in the intervening period.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   It's such a low bar.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.260]   It is such a low bar.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:26.220]   OK, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're going to be horrible, at least be consistent.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.100]   Like new, like new Gingrich is consistently horrible.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.700]   But consistently horrible.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   Yes.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]   All right.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.700]   OK.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.700]   Wow.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:35.900]   You don't want to go across.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:36.900]   That's a very, very short fit.
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:37.900]   I know.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.900]   I'm dancing around it.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:39.900]   We're going to go down there.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:40.900]   But here's the thing.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:46.340]   They know, they know that this is going to trigger all sorts of smell alerts because
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.860]   it does smell anti-competitive.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.460]   It does smell like this would be nothing but a losing bet for consumers.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:51.460]   But here's a argument.
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.780]   And they actually address this in the press release.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:31:00.740]   They say this is not going to run a file of anti-competition regulation because they don't
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.260]   currently compete in this arena.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.940]   This is not a cable infrastructure project.
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.260]   This is a wireless project.
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:12.740]   And therefore, since they don't currently hold any stake in that, they're just saying,
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.820]   well, you play over there and I play over here.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:15.820]   No.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.820]   I don't think that makes it better.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:17.980]   But that's their argument.
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.980]   That's how they're going to defend this.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.820]   I wonder if that would work in court.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.660]   Broadband is broadband no matter how you get it.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:24.660]   OK.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.660]   That's what I guess.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.660]   Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:30.300]   And that's really what these companies are, you know, Comcast, Charter, Verizon.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.820]   They're all, it's a broadband play.
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.300]   Global TV is just sort of like a thing that they have now.
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:36.300]   Broadband's a future.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.300]   They know it's the future.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:42.060]   Whether they're going to shove that pipe into your house or over the air into your phone,
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.820]   it's still broadband and still anti-human.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:46.420]   So you don't draw distinction between wireline and wireless.
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.220]   Do you use the industry slang?
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.620]   No, not anymore.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.460]   And it's the old bits or bits.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.260]   Doesn't matter how you get the bits, you're getting the bits.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.260]   I agree this entirely.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.260]   I don't know what drives that.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.260]   I wish we had someone on the panel.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.260]   I like the word bits or bits.
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.260]   I don't need to disagree.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.260]   I just like the word bits.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.700]   Christina, could you please dismantle net neutrality?
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.700]   No.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:11.900]   No, in fact, actually one time I was asked to do that on a major cable network and I declined.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.660]   Wait, which one?
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:14.660]   Fox.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.100]   Wait, business or Fox, Fox, official Fox?
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.100]   No, Fox, Fox.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.620]   And I was specifically asked to go on.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.380]   They wanted me to talk about net neutrality and they specifically asked me to disagree.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:27.500]   And I said, I'm not going to do that.
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.460]   And then they were no longer interested in becoming on the network.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.260]   Did they say they wanted you to disagree as devil's advocate or they wanted you to pretend
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.540]   like that was your actual position?
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.540]   They needed some.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:44.260]   They wanted someone on expressly with the position that net neutrality was bad and came
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.260]   to me for that.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:49.140]   And the place that I worked at the time asked me, well, would you consider doing that?
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.860]   And I said, absolutely not.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.020]   And under no circumstances, will I go on television and say something that I don't believe just
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.180]   so we can go on television.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.180]   And yeah, that was.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.460]   As a small again, I'll cloud high five for ethics.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.460]   I find absolutely.
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:05.100]   But you don't need those anymore because you're no longer.
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.860]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:12.100]   Now you can go on the Fox and say on net neutrality, I heard that kills people.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:13.940]   Frank Shaw told me every time.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.380]   He's making me fired already.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:20.180]   What people don't know is that sort of preamble to a cable news hits incredibly common.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.740]   Like whenever you go on see, see in your little earpiece, they say, show us energy, show us
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.540]   energy and they pick people that have different opinions on purpose to create an argument
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.540]   on the network.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.540]   It's not by accident.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:33.540]   They pick people that are pro and con in a really simplistic fashion and then they amp
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.540]   you up and then they have you on for four minutes to argue and then they just drop you.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:38.540]   And then they drop you.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:42.540]   But in some cases, they will say I want you to talk about a specific issue and explain
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.540]   something.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:46.740]   And that's usually the context that I would go on television would be to explain something
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.860]   and usually not to have an opinion unless it was expressly asked.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:57.140]   This was a weird situation where I was expressly asked to hold an opinion and go on a show
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.940]   and argue for that opinion.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.100]   And that was something that was funny.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.820]   I can share this now because I'm no longer a journalist.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.980]   I was like, absolutely not.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   There's no way.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:06.980]   There's no way.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:08.180]   Wait, wait, wait, this is blowing me away.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.020]   Are you saying there are people out there who will prostitute their own personal opinions
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.020]   and their worldview in order to be on TV?
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.020]   We already talked about New Gingrich, man.
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:18.980]   And come on now.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:19.980]   No.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   Okay.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.420]   But let me try to play devil's advocate here.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.860]   All right.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.100]   We do want another player in the wireless service industry, correct?
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:35.580]   And we would desperately like another national player because any sort of competition on
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:38.380]   the national level will drive down prices for consumers.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:43.460]   So I could see themselves saying, look, we don't have enough capital to compete against
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.460]   another new player.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:48.900]   But if both of us get into this, eventually we will be at the level where we can compete
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:53.660]   with the Verizon, we can compete with the Sprint, we can compete with the T-Mobile.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.660]   Isn't that a good thing?
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:57.900]   I mean, don't we want to spark that competition?
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:03.260]   If they come back and say, look, if the FTC is going to come down and say, this is anti-competitive
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.020]   and we can't do it, then we just don't invest.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:07.820]   And isn't that a net loss for America?
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:10.820]   That was a really using Verizon's pipes.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820]   That was a really using Verizon's pipes.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.060]   Unless they're going to build their own pipes.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.820]   I was going to say because they're using Verizon.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:19.380]   So doesn't that immediately offset some of that?
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:24.220]   I mean, I would agree with you if they were actually investing in their own infrastructure.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.660]   I wouldn't necessarily agree that that was still, I wouldn't, I would necessarily agree
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.780]   with the argument that I would say that argument would be more valid.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:34.460]   In this case, though, they're going to be using Verizon's infrastructure, which to me
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:38.700]   says that ultimately Verizon raises the prices for certain things, the MV&Os, and have to
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.100]   raise the prices too.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.780]   So I don't even know how much more competition you have.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.500]   And I just looked up the numbers to your financial argument.
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:52.620]   And in the first quarter of this year, Comcast had $5.7 billion in cash provided by operating
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.980]   activities and free cash flow of $3.1 billion.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:59.580]   So the argument that they can't afford this to me is specious.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.300]   And the other argument here, and we'll hear it here as well as the net neutrality debate
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.680]   is the one they always always trumped out is regulation kills investment, which is not
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.900]   held out by the numbers.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.020]   Since the passage of net neutrality, we've seen a market spike in the amount of capital
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:17.780]   outlay for both spectrum and for deployment of fiber.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:20.180]   So it's those numbers are malleable.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.180]   Money is money.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:26.100]   Money is talking about specific numbers just for wire line investment over the last multi-year
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.980]   period since net neutrality.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:34.020]   And there is some data that indicates there was a mild impact in the negative.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.020]   But I mean--
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:37.220]   I like how you prep some mild.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:41.860]   Well, I mean, we're talking about economic data that is inherently politically weaponizable.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.420]   And so I don't want to say sound emphatic and clear cut when it's not.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.540]   Because the data you pick, the time frame you pick, and how you slice it is how you bend
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.980]   the things to your own political narrative.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.460]   And so that's what Ajit's doing.
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:54.460]   So I don't want to say he's wrong.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.100]   I bet he's technically correct in some ways.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:01.940]   But it's a deliberately, I would say, misshapen image of the broader investment landscape,
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.980]   the year outlining, which includes more than just one area of investment.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.980]   Right.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:08.340]   Clearly Comcast is not hurting.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:09.340]   No.
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:10.340]   I-- no.
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:13.740]   I paid for cable for like three years by accident and didn't have a TV.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.660]   So I think, God, good enough money for me.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.740]   How do you do that?
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.300]   He was cheaper when I moved in to get cable with my internet.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.340]   And then I did my TV and turned off.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.260]   So it's the last few thousand dollars.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.260]   That's what happened with me.
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.420]   And yeah, I'm still kind of mad about that.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:31.460]   No, wait, Kristina, you're going up to the Northwest.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.980]   Who's your provider up there?
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:34.980]   No idea.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.220]   I might be stuck with Comcast.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.140]   Suddenly, I think it depends on what area we're in.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.180]   I love my current provider optimum.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.300]   I wish that the cable vision or Altus, whoever the French company that bought them is.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.180]   I wish that they would--
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.820]   were available where I'm going because they're great.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.380]   But I have no idea who my ISP is going to be.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:59.860]   I just got a notice at my place that our campus is now available for sonic.net, which
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.940]   makes me incredibly happy because they can get fiber.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.460]   I'm going to get the 10 gig package.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.500]   I'm getting fiber at my house from Sonic.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.700]   I'm on Comcast.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.220]   And I'm just like three months.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:09.580]   I'm just like--
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:10.780]   Here's the fun part with Comcast.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:15.940]   Comcast goes-- we basically own a block in the sunset in San Francisco.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:21.540]   Comcast goes to all four corners of that block and all the houses around that block.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.020]   But to come across the street, they want to charge us $150,000.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:25.540]   Wow.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.020]   So we're like, no, that's OK.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.740]   Well, just don't get 10K to the dev group 10, 15 times.
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:30.900]   And you'll have it right there.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.660]   And you'll get so many miles near PayPal account.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.820]   Oh my gosh.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:34.300]   Oh, you're--
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:35.580]   I'd be set for life.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:40.700]   Oh, and by the way, just as a disclaimer, Sonic is a sponsor of the This Week in Tech
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.380]   Network.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.020]   But yeah, I don't know.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:49.380]   I get it that this is the environment we're in.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:54.460]   I mean, I don't think you would have heard an announcement like this last year.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.900]   Because they figured that, yeah, they're going to be held accountable.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:00.420]   But the fact that they're willing to do this openly and to make it sound like it's
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.940]   a wonderful thing for consumers, that's got me worried.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:06.940]   That's actually the story for me above the fact that they just announced it.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.340]   It's the fact that they think this is going to be OK.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.660]   You know, this is cool.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.980]   Well, and the thing is that I think they have a good shot at convincing
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:19.100]   people because if you look at what has already happened with a zero rating and how that has
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:23.020]   been kind of advertised as a good thing to consumers and consumers are like, oh, well,
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:24.660]   look, I get unlimited data now.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.980]   And look, I can get-- you know, my YouTube videos don't count and this doesn't count.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.940]   And look at all this value I'm getting.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:35.220]   I mean, they're really selling zero rating as being a good thing for consumers, even
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:41.260]   though ultimately it has a lot of really scary implications that bigger picture people
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260]   should consider.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.260]   But that's not how it's being presented.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:46.780]   And I don't think that's how regular people see it.
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:50.740]   So yeah, I mean, if you use enough bezwords and say competition enough times and we're
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.460]   going to lower your prices enough times, you know, people might still be weary because
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:59.300]   I think most consumers don't trust their service providers.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.420]   So it's a lower prices.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.300]   But they might just see on the surface, oh, well, this is a good thing.
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.220]   You know, I could see that they could make that convincing argument just because it's
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:08.220]   already worked with zero rating.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.620]   Well, in Comcast is a really popular company with consumers.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:15.860]   You know, it's got a great customer service reputation, very fair pricing, quick service.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.220]   You know, I mean, they're really absolute.
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.540]   They're actually better than Apple on the net promoter score of American consumers.
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.540]   Okay, they are.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:23.540]   They are.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:24.540]   Let's be fair.
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:25.540]   Let's be fair here.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:26.540]   Absolutely.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:27.540]   I'm with you.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.540]   They are.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:29.540]   They have a horrible customer support reputation.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:30.540]   Deserve at least so.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:35.740]   Very if you ever get caught up in admin hell with Comcast, like for example, they say
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:38.660]   you haven't returned a piece of equipment, even though you know what you have that can
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.540]   go on for months and months and months.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:41.540]   And there's so many people.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.540]   Right?
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.540]   Right.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.180]   No, seriously, when I moved from Atlanta to New York, they still think that I have a
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.660]   cable box that I do not have.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.660]   And it took me.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.660]   I'm not even joking.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.740]   Like two and a half years to get it off of my credit report.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.740]   It was a nightmare.
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.060]   Did you got to get just Twitter men just line them up on Twitter?
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.060]   You're verified.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.060]   That's just awesome.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.820]   I mean, I know it's like we it's in a privilege.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:04.660]   We get to abuse, but like whenever I need stuff fixed, I just, but I mean, it's like their
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.740]   strategy is, well, we're Comcast.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.060]   You're going to get tired before we do.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.620]   And that's that's not a great, but okay.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:17.340]   But on the other side, if you've ever been in a place where all you have is AT&T DSL,
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.340]   you dream of having Comcast.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.540]   As bad as it is, you dream of having cable.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:25.500]   I had AT&T DSL and their customer service was actually worse than Comcast.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.620]   They hung up on me like multiple times.
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:31.540]   I'm like, okay, I reset everything.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:32.860]   Yeah, I know.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:33.860]   Yeah, I know.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:35.860]   No, you're don't know.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.060]   It's right now I'm doing 46 K download.
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.060]   No, I've been on a click.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:45.220]   Yeah, no, I actually dialed up in order to get faster service.
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.940]   So maybe you could come out and fix this.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.700]   How fast was it supposed to be?
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:51.620]   It was the actual, it didn't matter.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:53.980]   ATT DSL, how fast is it supposed to be?
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.980]   Yes, not even AT&T knows really.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.980]   It was really, really bad.
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:00.140]   Fast doesn't satellite is all they can promise.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:02.420]   Yeah, that is depressing.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:07.180]   Fashion someone running across town with the webpage, prints it out.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.180]   That's what they're.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.180]   That's all they promise.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.940]   That's actually their service level of game.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.900]   I'm monitoring to print out an email this week.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:13.900]   Can I talk her out of it?
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.900]   I was like, what?
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900]   Oh, no.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.900]   Sorry, it's off topic.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.900]   No, actually, no, there's nothing off topic when you're talking about Comcast, really.
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.900]   It's just a nice thing to me.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:27.460]   It never fails to make everyone laugh because everyone's had an experience or a phone call
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.460]   with them.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.460]   Everyone knows.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.460]   We've all had it.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.460]   Everyone knows.
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:37.900]   Have you heard their new commercial campaign and it's like the caring mother type thing.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:42.820]   We know that you have a busy life, which is why we think Comcast should work around
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.020]   your schedule than you working around Comcast.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.580]   I'm thinking, when have you ever done that ever?
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.780]   Also, you just got there?
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:51.780]   That's it.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:43:00.180]   Like, oh, a few years back, we had a Comcast rep who wanted to be on this week in Enterprise
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:01.580]   Tech.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.180]   And I had worked with this person before.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:05.180]   I really didn't want him on the show.
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:08.260]   But I was trying to be nice, trying to build a relationship.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:12.340]   But their PR people just got really aggressive.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:17.340]   And so at one point I said, okay, fine, come on Friday, X, X day at this time, da, da, da,
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:19.580]   and they said, okay, when can we expect you to connect?
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:23.420]   I said, well, sometime between noon and six.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:29.020]   And it took them a sec and they're like, oh, yeah.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:30.020]   You just wait.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.020]   We'll be right there.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:32.420]   Did you actually keep it that way?
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:34.060]   No, they've never called back.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.060]   Okay.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.060]   Which I'm okay with.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.060]   Sorry about that.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.660]   All right, we're going to be back in just a second.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:45.340]   We have one more big story I do want to cover because something interesting happened last
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.340]   week.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:51.620]   And that was that hackers of an election got owned by the French, D'Ivo La France.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:55.220]   But first, let's go ahead and take a moment to thank another sponsor of this week in tech.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:59.740]   Now, we've been talking a lot here about things that we've read, things that we've learned,
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.980]   things that we've consumed from other media outlets because let's face it.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:07.020]   Information in this day and age just isn't something that's good for you to know.
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:09.700]   It's something you need to participate in society.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.860]   The question is, do you have the right app?
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.860]   Do you have the right service?
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.940]   Do you have the right process to make sure you can get all of your trusted news sources
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:17.940]   in one place?
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:21.540]   Well, if you use texture, yes, you do.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:25.700]   This episode of this week in tech is brought to you by texture with everything changing
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.700]   in the tech space.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.140]   There is so much to learn.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:32.380]   You can read up on the latest projects from Zuckerberg to what Elon Musk is doing is free
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.700]   time or maybe you can get the scoop on the new must have drone from your favorite tech
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.060]   journalist and editors.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:41.900]   You could download the texture app and get access to hundreds of magazines like Wired
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.860]   and PC World.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:47.740]   Texture has gone beyond just delivering the magazine itself.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:52.900]   They've made it easy for you to find and enjoy the articles that you want to read with daily
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:57.020]   recommendations, with exclusive interactive features, with videos and more.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.300]   A texture is searchable.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:02.980]   You can mark what you like, check out back issues and view bonus video content all from
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:03.980]   the same app.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:07.580]   And you can use texture to access not just your favorite magazine, but the latest and
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:12.660]   greatest and investigative journalism, US politics, domestic and international news.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.140]   The texture app is entirely digital, so it's environmentally friendly.
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:20.060]   And it's the best way to consume magazines and articles.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:24.380]   Texture is normally $9.99 a month and you get over 200 magazines.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:28.260]   Why subscribe to just a few magazines when you could get them all?
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:34.020]   All of them on your favorite topics, on your smartphone, on your tablet, for less.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:37.940]   Texture was selected as one of Apple's top 2016 iPad apps.
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:41.180]   And if you try it out, I know you're going to find out why.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:48.020]   Right now, Texture is offering our audience a 14 day free trial when you go to texture.com/twit.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:50.620]   That's texture.com/twit.
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:55.700]   That's 14 days to try texture for free to see if it will be your source of definitive
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.700]   news.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:01.060]   And when you go to texture.com/twit.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.540]   And we thank Texture for their support of this week in tech.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.940]   All right, let's back up a week because this story I absolutely love living in the security
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.180]   world, living in the network world.
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:16.060]   This is something I think is going to be the standard going forward.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:20.260]   Now we know that in France, there was a politically motivated attack, cyber attack, just like
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.820]   we've had in other countries, we had it here in the United States.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.900]   It happened in Germany.
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:27.460]   It's ongoing in Germany and it's ongoing in the UK.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:32.580]   In the US elections, and what we've seen in Germany is you've had ex-filtration of large
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.500]   amounts of information, which are then weaponized.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.900]   They can be released along with false information to make it sound like a leak is much worse
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:42.900]   than it actually is.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:45.180]   And it does sway elections.
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:46.860]   Let's be honest there.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:52.660]   Now the New York Times has a great article about how this all played.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:56.420]   Now Michael S. Rogers, he's an admiral with the NSA.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:47:01.940]   He testified in the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that his agency saw the
[01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:03.220]   attack unfolding.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:04.220]   They were looking at traffic.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:05.220]   They were looking at spikes.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.940]   They were looking at what the intelligence was saying.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:10.060]   They said, look, someone is trying to undermine the French election.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.100]   So he reached out to his French counterparts.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:15.620]   And to his surprise, they basically said, no, no, no, we got this.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:17.940]   Oh, maybe you're way too late.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:18.940]   Yes, I got out.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.340]   Well, we're all over this.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.340]   But thanks.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:26.100]   The French knew it because they were actually on guard for this.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.180]   They assumed that they would be attacked.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.300]   And when they started to receive what they called high quality phishing attacks for their
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:35.740]   employees, they said, OK, it's on game on.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:39.420]   And now here's what I think was brilliant about their strategy.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:43.580]   They had a war room meeting and they said, there is no way we're going to be able to
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.660]   secure every employee, every computer.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.020]   It's just not possible.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.500]   Something will leak.
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.780]   So how do we deal with it?
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.580]   And they said, well, how about this?
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:56.220]   What if we just assume that something's going to leak?
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.620]   And why don't we influence the leak?
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:04.180]   So what they did was they started working in a counter offensive.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:08.300]   They mixed in disinformation with the cash that would be stolen.
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.700]   For example, one of my favorites was they created documents that looked like smoking
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.700]   guns.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:18.660]   They had a purchase, a series of emails that looked like a high level staffer was purchasing
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:19.660]   bath salts.
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:23.700]   And it's stimulus on the internet and paying for it in Bitcoin.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.460]   And this is one of those things like if you were if you were trying to hack the election,
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:28.140]   it's like, oh, my gosh, he's high.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.140]   Right.
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.140]   I've got it.
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:31.140]   I've got it.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.300]   And but on the surface, if you were just looking at if is the document real, did it come from
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.340]   from the treasure trove, you would say yes.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:42.740]   But if you dug further, you would find out in the Bitcoin ledger, there is no such transaction.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:46.580]   And that's the kind of information that they sewed into the trove.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:50.380]   Are you saying that when WikiLeaks gets a big old dump of data from Russian sources,
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.940]   they don't actually go through with a fine tooth comb to verify it?
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:53.940]   I am shocked.
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:54.940]   What?
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:55.940]   I know.
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.660]   Wait, one dude locked in an embassy by himself with little staff.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:00.900]   Isn't that you're doing a whole bunch of really, really minuscule legwork digitally?
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:02.420]   Oh, that was the other one.
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:04.020]   I mean, because WikiLeaks, they came out.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.020]   He's the cat.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020]   Yeah, he has the cat.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.020]   He has a cat.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.020]   Yeah, he has a cat.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:09.020]   None of those jokes are okay.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:13.340]   But but WikiLeaks, they did tweet out when when this was starting the surface that this
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:17.620]   would happen, and they said, I very much doubt that the French authorities have the ability
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:19.340]   to vet information faster than we do.
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.900]   And the French were like, no, that's because we pre-vetted everything.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.340]   We know it's fake.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.220]   I love WikiLeaks trying to be all like nerd powerful.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.420]   Like, oh, they can't read faster than we can.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.420]   Really?
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:31.300]   Oh, man, six weeks ago, you are still dumb.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.300]   So there's one of you in a country.
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.980]   It's more Francis, like as big as Kentucky, right?
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:39.700]   So you know, still bigger than a room of an embassy in a cat.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:45.660]   But this opens up a new thing that this this has been the fact of standard for many organizations
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:46.660]   around the world.
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:47.940]   This is actually being pointed out in our chat room right now.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:51.660]   In fact, my organization uses us all the time.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:55.380]   Wait, the school, your family or the or the characters?
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:56.380]   Yes.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:57.380]   Yes.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.220]   I have free birth dates, just FYI.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:06.020]   But this this is something that you you use because you know there's going to be a leak.
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:08.420]   At some point data is going to get out.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:12.580]   And if you can throw it even a little bit of doubt into that data and have a way to verify
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:19.580]   that the data was wrong, then it's very difficult to actually affect me with something that
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.580]   you've stolen.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.820]   Wasn't there also a media blackout for two days before the election?
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.820]   Which is normal.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:25.820]   That's normal.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:26.820]   That's okay.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.820]   There's no campaigning.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:28.820]   You don't campaign right before.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:31.700]   But this was time to come out the Friday before so that way they wouldn't be able to respond
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.540]   to it and it still didn't have the impact they were they were looking for precisely.
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.780]   So the way it works is they're not allowed to campaign.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:41.060]   The officials are not allowed to campaign, but you can still have news and this is supposed
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:42.060]   to be a news article.
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:43.060]   But it got.
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:44.060]   Okay.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:45.060]   Misinformation.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.900]   Yeah, my my I don't have my birthday.
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:48.900]   No.
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.580]   I think I took mine off to Facebook and Twitter at last because if I really tell people.
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:56.620]   I have sometimes people like want to tweet me on my birthday and so I had to go in and
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:02.220]   create fake birthdays so it would populate their calendars because I realized I had taken
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:07.020]   my birthday off and I changed it and then removed it from Facebook but people still
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:09.620]   had their calendar so they were tweeting at me on my birthday so I would respond to
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:11.500]   it and like please delete your tweet.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:16.380]   So now I've I've changed the birthday I've made it public, waited to populate their calendars
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.300]   and I changed it again.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.380]   So now they're like two or three birthdays behind.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:24.300]   I always put disinformation on my social media.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.540]   I mean that's just sort of.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:29.380]   I'm not even really a tech journalist.
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:30.380]   That would explain a lot.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.460]   But it does explain a lot.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.980]   I'm actually not a priest.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:35.980]   Why is just a letdown?
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.300]   I'm a I'm a plant.
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.900]   I only have so many friends who are priests.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:39.900]   The number is two.
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:40.900]   Okay.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:41.900]   There you go.
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:45.660]   But I mean is this going to be the standard from going forward?
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:46.660]   Anyone.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:50.980]   I'm not just talking about political campaigns but will there be chief disinformation officers
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.100]   who look for strategic ways to to see this in in a way that doesn't affect corporate
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:59.580]   operations but anyone who obtains the data won't know how to interpret it.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.580]   So there has to be.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.380]   I mean Apple's been doing this for forever with Leek.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:03.380]   That's true.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:06.140]   I mean if you aren't taken from Apple's playbook.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.700]   Well Apple takes it a step further.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.140]   They'll leak seven different things so they can figure out where they're going.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:12.140]   Exactly.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.300]   Where where it came from and figure out who to hire.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:15.300]   Sounds like a great wire.
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:16.300]   It's environment.
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:17.300]   What shouldn't?
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.300]   Right?
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.300]   Don't leak your stuff.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:22.980]   I mean I have no secrets to leak sadly but it sounds like that's your culture that you're
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:27.140]   deliberately trying to suss out Leekers via disinformation, intro your staff.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.140]   I mean ugh.
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.140]   That's what happens.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.140]   A lot of money.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:37.180]   It was interesting how the narrative on this changed so much in 72 hours that it was really
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.180]   running.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:42.260]   Because at first there was a leak and everyone's like oh this is going this is going to lose
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:47.660]   in the election and then very quickly there were it didn't come from the campaign.
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:50.640]   It was coming from people who were looking at the treasure trove saying there's something
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.060]   not right here.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.100]   This data is and the one that they found quickly was the Bitcoin one.
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   They said this should be a smoking gun.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:58.100]   It's not.
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:03.700]   And then that puts questions on any of the information because even if it's accurate or
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700]   not it doesn't matter.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:09.260]   You now have that level of distrust because the Bitcoin address didn't come out.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:13.420]   This information is inaccurate so how can we know the rest of this information is valid?
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:17.860]   And they took a playbook straight out of the hackers a play out of the hackers playbook
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:19.980]   because this is what they had been using.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:25.460]   They had taken some true information put in their own false information to seem worse.
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:26.460]   The French did the opposite.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:27.460]   They said okay what?
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:30.780]   They let you get some of that true information but we're going to see it in false information
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:33.340]   so everyone will assume any information you have is tainted.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:35.620]   But critically the pen only got 39 point.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.620]   Right.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:37.620]   Some of the votes.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.620]   It was the landslide.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.580]   The result is that even though they tried their best to influence the election by doing
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:45.220]   this horrible thing they'd only lost operationally they'd lost in terms of results.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:48.180]   So they could have actually defeated this operationally through the methods you described
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:51.180]   and still actually had the election told us in their favor it didn't work.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:52.820]   But how much of that is the French?
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:53.980]   That's a French societal thing.
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.980]   I mean that's very.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:57.660]   I feel like French folks will get us in trouble with someone.
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.140]   But I mean my point is they lost twice and so that's what I like about this story.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:04.900]   The election result didn't go the way they wanted it to and they were owned before they
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:05.900]   even knew it.
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.180]   And so that makes me very happy.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:12.900]   If we lose to this consistently democracy is undermined globally which I think would be
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:13.900]   not be very good.
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:19.180]   So I'm glad we have some tools here and fight back and if we cannot apply these systemically
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.580]   across all the elections moving forward and hopefully even new and better tools this is
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:25.660]   not something that complicated.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:30.660]   If you're a parent and you have a child teach that child, Oppsec or info sec and put them
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:35.780]   in that industry make them because there's not enough there's not enough people on the
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:39.780]   good side taking care like helping companies helping everyone.
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:41.580]   Being on the good side will.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.580]   You don't get paid.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:46.620]   A five figure salary and being on the dark side can or maybe with seven figures.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.620]   Oh no no.
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:48.780]   You know on the rise level it's really six.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:52.380]   I mean like good good security people are are very valuable.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:55.860]   They're probably worth about as much as a self driving car tech guys right now.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:58.380]   People right now stuff they have on sale at Defcon that I've gotten.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:00.940]   I can't I can't afford that.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:05.260]   This is the first time in in almost 20 years that I'm going to miss Defcon.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:06.260]   You're not going to go.
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.260]   I can't.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:08.260]   I'm in silence during that time.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.340]   I have a two month thing I have to do.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.700]   It's a it's a priest thing and do you do you go and talk for two months?
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.700]   No I'm I will not be on the internet.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:20.580]   I have no laptops no desktops no phones for two months.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.580]   What do you do?
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.860]   I've heard about this thing.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.580]   The priest used to do it back in the day.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:27.580]   I got it.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:28.580]   Pray.
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:29.580]   Pray.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.580]   Gotta do that.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.580]   There's an empty hammer song about it.
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:34.580]   Meditate.
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:37.580]   What if like a month in you're like I don't know I can't do it.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.380]   Because you've done I've already done it.
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:40.380]   Oh okay.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:41.380]   Because I mean this is it's not new for me.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.820]   They do like a weekend retreat with yoga sounds terrifying to me.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:45.820]   I guess that's like two whole days of no laptops.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:46.820]   Like come on now.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:49.220]   Yeah hot yoga with a bunch of priests.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:50.220]   That's not no.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:52.220]   Whoa whoa whoa.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.380]   I don't hang out with I got told you I have two priest friends.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.380]   I can't even get both in the room at the same time.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:58.180]   But I mean two months.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.380]   Does everyone do this in your order?
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.380]   Oh yes.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.380]   Okay.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.380]   Still impressive.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:03.380]   It's a bummer.
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.380]   You're a miss Defcon.
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:05.380]   25.
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:06.380]   Yeah I'm really bummed I'm gonna miss Defcon.
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:09.020]   I'm good friends with with lost who makes the badges.
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.660]   Oh yeah I interviewed him last year really.
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:13.900]   And so he asked me because he heard I was I wasn't gonna be able to make the show.
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.220]   He goes hey do you want me to send you a badge?
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.220]   I'm like oh yes.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.220]   Oh yeah.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:18.220]   Nice.
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:19.220]   He offered to send you an uber.
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.220]   I'm like that's not right.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.140]   No you have to earn an uber.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.700]   You've been a Defcon right Christina?
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.700]   I have.
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:28.500]   So yeah the uber is the I'm a geek I saw one of the major challenges.
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:29.700]   I'm like no you have to earn that.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.620]   That's not if you walk into the show with an uber and you can't tell them what you wanted
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:37.260]   for that's no you should you should leave.
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:42.260]   I always start looking at the crypto stuff and then I get like five minutes in them all.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.740]   Shut.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:45.820]   I don't need that badge.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:46.820]   I'm not.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:49.140]   Well I know just I love the hardware hacking village.
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.180]   It's a place where you can sit and just be with like-minded people and geek out and
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.180]   solder stuff.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.180]   Yeah it's great.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.180]   You gotta go to Defcon.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.180]   You've never been to Defcon?
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.180]   It's the best.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:59.180]   You know I don't cover security so you don't have to.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.940]   You don't have to just go to go.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:03.540]   Audience have any of you ever been to Defcon?
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:04.540]   No.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:10.740]   Can you just all the thing there is no place more romantic more relaxing that Las Vegas
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:11.740]   in August.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.940]   Yeah that is with a bunch of hackers.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.940]   That sounds so awful.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.380]   With a burner computer and a burner phone is the greatest phone electronics.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.380]   No nothing.
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.100]   You're actually on it.
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.500]   Yeah bring burner stuff for sure.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.860]   Do they change casino technology?
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:28.860]   No they do not.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:29.860]   They're hilarious.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.740]   I presume it's got to be breakable right?
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:35.300]   I mean like they've got millions of dollars flowing through those gambling floors and they've
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:39.900]   got the world's most nefarious slash hilarious slash lulzy hackers bouncing around.
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.660]   That just sounds like a recipe for like losses.
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:45.540]   Oh yeah they've gotten better at it recently but like last year.
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:50.780]   They found someone did a scan of the area around where we held Defcon.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:55.260]   And before the show a week before the show there were seven repeaters, seven cellular
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.420]   repeaters.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:57.420]   During the show there were 40.
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:02.180]   Someone's like oh man in the middle of tax.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:08.500]   A while back one of my first Defcons there was a notice in the employee lounge for the
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:19.660]   Kelly where it was being held and it asked wait wait the area.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.620]   Did you mean the area?
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:24.380]   No no it was the Alexis Park sorry.
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:25.380]   That's a lot closer.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:26.620]   Yeah I can forgive that.
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:32.380]   But there was a notice asking employees to watch out for ATM machines that they hadn't
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.380]   seen previously.
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:36.380]   Because that was the thing people would just set up ATM machines you'd put your card in
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:37.380]   and scan.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:42.820]   And I'm like you don't use an ATM machine anywhere or if you're yanking on it hitting
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.500]   it I'm like I don't need that.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.500]   You won't do that.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:51.900]   I do it every ATM machine unless it's like at Bank of America I yank on it.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:54.300]   You always check the yank on the little card reader right?
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.300]   Yeah Christina.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.300]   Oh yes.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:59.860]   Yeah because I've been skimmed in my neighborhood in Brooklyn because of mistakes.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:00.860]   So yes.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:05.540]   I always put my wallet over my fingers when I'm typing in case there's a camera trying
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:06.540]   to capture.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:08.540]   You don't do this.
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.900]   No you need to get a death card.
[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:12.900]   No that is not paranoia.
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:13.900]   You should do that.
[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:14.900]   That's a good thing.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:19.540]   I never take out cash because I live in 2017.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:20.540]   Wow.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.540]   Cash is still a function.
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:22.540]   You ever used an ATM machine?
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:23.540]   You can write me a check it's cool.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:25.540]   You can use an ATM machine at all.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:27.540]   I don't I mean I quit drinking so no.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:28.540]   Oh okay.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.940]   I mean like there's a dive bar ATM.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:35.380]   I became best friends with it and then I broke up with it and now it's just me and my apartment
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.380]   drinking green juice.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:38.580]   I think the best place to put a skimmer is a dive bar ATM.
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:41.020]   No because no one's going to be like I'm going to check this before.
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:45.740]   Seriously seriously that's where I was skimmed in my neighborhood was like a dive bar.
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:46.740]   See?
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:52.140]   And I knew it as soon as it happened I was like oh I do it it was one of those things
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:56.860]   I was like words I can't say on this show I was like I was so angry and I was immediately
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.380]   I was like all right got to call the bank.
[01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:00.380]   This has happened.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:02.220]   Amazon voices this day you just keep yelling over it.
[02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:05.380]   I just want to I want to find one of those because I want to take it.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:07.260]   I really do I want one of those.
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:08.260]   Take it home.
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:10.900]   There's a whole meme on Reddit about this people are like they show a picture of one
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:13.940]   they found and then someone will be submitted a picture of like an ATM just like destroy
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:17.060]   like I found one guys.
[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:20.500]   I love how that means it's popping up but I mean how often do you actually see them?
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:25.380]   I mean like you've been skimmed once but I mean if you go to Defcon you absolutely
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:28.940]   be at least one outside of Nerda Palooza.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.140]   Well I've never found one.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:36.700]   I've never found one but I did teach my Jesuit brothers when I was living in St. Louis to
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.220]   just tug on the little thing really quickly and one of my brothers did find one.
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:41.220]   Okay.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:46.580]   I got skimmed at a gas station in Texas outside of the airport.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.660]   ATR were just like the payment machine.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660]   Just the payment machine.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:53.660]   Really because it was my work it was my work card and I did it and then like moved and
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:56.220]   I'm like and I'm gonna miss my phone.
[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:57.980]   You couldn't pull it off.
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:05.360]   So like I'm like and then like a week later they're like did you charge $46 at the pigly
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.360]   wiggly?
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:10.860]   And then all of a sudden it was like $400 at Walmart.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.740]   Oh it was like is it your AOL card?
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:13.740]   Yes my AOL card.
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:16.940]   So the way the the way those old cards used to work was if you spent more than $75 on
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:18.740]   one transaction you'd have a receipt.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.420]   So that's probably why they started catching those.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:21.420]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:25.020]   Now something I like about having an American Express card that's also tied to my frequent
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.900]   flyer account.
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:28.660]   They know where I'll be.
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:30.660]   I don't have to tell them I'm going to the country.
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.300]   They have that information.
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:40.340]   So for example I got a pop up when I was in Tokyo that someone had my card and was trying
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:43.820]   to buy something in California and I was able to immediately hit on the app.
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.820]   No.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.140]   Like in real time.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.140]   Your life sounds cool.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.140]   I have it on the page.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.140]   Thank you America.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:53.060]   America hits me up when like when they were something weird happened they hit me up like
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:54.060]   right away.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.060]   Tokyo.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.060]   I have lost.
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.060]   I have like first down.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:58.060]   This is very cool.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.540]   So the list can be fun.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:02.140]   It's a Lewis has a zoo.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:04.900]   That was the best self.
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.900]   They have the arch.
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:06.900]   They have the arch.
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:09.140]   They have a botanical garden.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:10.140]   Good music.
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:11.140]   Once a year they have balloons.
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:12.580]   Oh man.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.740]   This is riveting stuff.
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:14.740]   No.
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:15.740]   There's a he has balloons.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.740]   No.
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:17.980]   I mean hot balloons like hot air balloons.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:19.980]   There's like a little race.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:20.980]   Oh gosh.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:21.980]   Okay.
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:23.820]   No, I'm also not so big on Saint Louis.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.020]   So I thought my my parents are from Kansas City.
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:27.020]   I get to hang on.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.540]   Casey Casey Mo because he mo.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:32.700]   Oh, well, I think I think what we were all trying to say with this discussion is that
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.660]   if you're going to hack an election, make sure you don't use a compromised ATM.
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:38.660]   Correct.
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:42.460]   Again, that's the second time we've gone off the rails that I don't know.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.020]   You have to corral us.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.660]   You got to corral us away from this because we'll do this.
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:47.660]   Everyone is coming up.
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.660]   It's so good though.
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:49.660]   Yes.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:52.180]   And I'm assuming Christina is not growing.
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:53.700]   None of you are just going to be me.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:54.700]   I'm fine.
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.700]   I'm not going.
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.820]   You're going to be in the area.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.100]   The West Coast is all one big place.
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:02.100]   I'll be closer.
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:03.460]   Yeah, I'll be closer.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.340]   Well, when in August, is it?
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.340]   No, it's July.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.820]   They actually pushed it off weekend.
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:10.300]   I think it was a lie.
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:11.300]   Never mind.
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:14.820]   Because I am going to be in Vegas in August, but that's for Bernie Spears.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.940]   So she's doing that residency show, right?
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:17.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:18.940]   It's coming to an end.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:19.940]   It's coming to an end.
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:21.940]   And so I'm looking forward to Metallica.
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:22.940]   Does that in like 15 years?
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:25.460]   And I was going to see Metallica for a week in their Vegas residency.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.460]   It'll be amazing.
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:31.900]   If you do go to Defcon, make sure to check out a dual core who will be, he always performs.
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:34.260]   He does nerd core rap.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.460]   I'm okay.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:36.820]   It's actually a lot cooler than I just did.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:37.820]   I'm not saying I'm nerd core.
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:38.820]   It's nerd core.
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:39.820]   No, he's really good.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:40.820]   He's really, really good.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:41.820]   Dual core.
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:42.820]   He's called dual core.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:43.820]   The group's called dual core.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:45.940]   We call him 80 as an interrupt 80.
[02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.860]   I'm going to, I'm going to spotify right now so I can write this down.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:49.860]   Okay.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:51.740]   Is it dual core one word or dual core two words?
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.980]   A dual capital, capital C chord, dual core.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:58.380]   And the song you want to listen to is "Hack All the Things."
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:59.380]   That's a little on the nose.
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:00.380]   It is, right?
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:02.100]   Is this year's badge going to be analog or digital?
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:03.100]   It should be analog.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:04.100]   This is analog.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:05.100]   This is analog.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:06.100]   Because last year was digital.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:08.700]   Because I talked to him last year and he's like, "Well, I kind of want to talk to him
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:12.380]   to do something digital because it's the 25th year, but at the same time, you know."
[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:21.580]   Well, the last analog Uber, he used irradiated glass, which was...
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:24.900]   Phenomenal because it's so difficult to fake that.
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.740]   For everyone who's listening, like I was a minute ago and think you're talking about
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:29.100]   the company Uber, what is it?
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.100]   The Uber.
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:31.100]   And why does it matter?
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:32.100]   And why do we care?
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.620]   And how do you earn them and why are they blah?
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:37.940]   If you go to Defcon, you will see people walking around with different kinds of badges.
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:40.180]   And typically they're black or have some element of black into them.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:41.780]   They're called the Uber badges.
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:44.020]   An Uber badge goes to someone super elite.
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:47.180]   And it's typically because you've won a competition.
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:54.100]   You solve the contest, like capture the flag or the badge hack or the crypto challenge.
[02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:58.220]   And with an Uber badge, you get lifetime admittance to Defcon for free.
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:04:59.220]   Oh, that's super...
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.020]   Oh, those are really cool.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.420]   It's more than an admittance.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:05.060]   If you have an Uber badge, people know that you're damn good at what you do.
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.060]   That's the right of it.
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:07.060]   Can we see that on the show?
[02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:08.060]   Yeah, damn.
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.060]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:10.060]   I was so lied to tears ago.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:12.060]   That's the Uber badge.
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:15.300]   Okay, so if you haven't seen these, go ahead and look them up.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:18.020]   Because they actually are really ornate and pretty cool.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.420]   And I would love to have one of these.
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:21.140]   The eyeballs pop out on that, by the way.
[02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:22.140]   Oh, really?
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.140]   Okay.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:24.140]   This hits all of my nerd's ends.
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:25.860]   It took loss so long to assemble those.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:28.780]   And now that we're speaking about things that no one can see, even if they're watching
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:30.180]   the video version, there we go.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.180]   See.
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:32.180]   It's radioactive.
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:33.820]   That is super cool.
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:36.020]   And then Uber's name was then ruined by Travis.
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:37.020]   Oh, well.
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:40.700]   Oh, folks, I'm getting a sign from the producer who's saying that we're running out of time.
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.620]   Is there any story we have uncovered that we really should at least talk a little bit
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:44.620]   about?
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.020]   The chat got whacked.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.220]   We expected that though, right?
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:48.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:50.180]   That's what I worked on most this week.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:53.500]   That actually affects me because one of our sister's schools, St. Francis, they're the
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.420]   ones who had that amazing IPO bonus.
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:58.420]   They invested $15,000.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.420]   Yeah, but they got $25 million.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:02.420]   And now it's- And immediately I told them sell.
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:03.420]   Yeah.
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:04.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:05.420]   And they didn't.
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:08.860]   Well, it opened at 24, shots 29, 44, and now it's at 18.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.860]   Whoops.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:10.860]   And that's still overpriced.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:11.860]   Yes.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:15.620]   I was very proud of my headline for during the earnings call.
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:16.620]   I will say this.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.220]   It was a Snapchat debut, disappearing stock price.
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:20.420]   Oh, that was a good.
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:21.900]   I remember seeing that.
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:22.900]   Ten points.
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.900]   Was that your last article?
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:28.940]   But Christina, you don't get to do that anymore because you're not a journalist.
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:29.940]   I'm not.
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.580]   No, my last article was predictably about rose gold.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:34.300]   And that is not a joke.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:35.300]   Rose gold.
[02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:37.940]   Yeah, I wrote a blog about my love for rose gold.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:38.940]   Oh, okay.
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:40.820]   I love the finish.
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:41.820]   I was in the finish.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:42.820]   I was in the color.
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:44.220]   And I said, the best thing has ever happened in tech.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:46.820]   And I will hear no arguments.
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.380]   That was my final blog.
[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:50.060]   Does fashion conform to Moore's blog?
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:51.540]   I'm not sure.
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:52.540]   Sometimes.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:53.540]   Sometimes.
[02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:57.580]   Can they make our rose gold zoons?
[02:06:57.580 --> 02:06:58.740]   I have a chocolate zoom.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.740]   Do not make fun of those.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.740]   I had a halo zoom.
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:01.740]   I bought the black sign.
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:02.740]   And it got stolen.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:03.740]   Great device.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:04.740]   I missed it.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.740]   All right.
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:07.900]   Well, I think that means that we're going to be running to the end here.
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.780]   I do want to give my guests here a chance to talk a little bit about their projects
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:13.940]   because, well, this has been a fun show.
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.900]   I haven't done this in three years and I probably won't do it for another three years, but
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:19.260]   I'm glad I did it with you.
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:23.820]   Alex, Alex, what are you doing that people should know about?
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:26.100]   Yeah, I'm the editor in chief of Crunchbase News.
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.780]   It's a new media org we're building over at Crunchbase, which is a data company.
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:33.580]   So if you want to read some really nerdy financial stuff, you can go to crunchbase.news
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:35.180]   in your browser and say hi.
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.540]   And we see you quite a few times on the new screen savers.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:38.540]   I think you've done that show what?
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:39.540]   Four times?
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:40.540]   Three times?
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.540]   They keep bringing me on because I'm youthful, I think, is how it works out.
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:44.540]   Well, you're a millennial.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:45.540]   That's true.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.540]   Yeah.
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:47.540]   I presumably kind of trot me out to attracting a younger audience.
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:48.540]   I don't know.
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:49.540]   I love coming up here.
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:52.180]   I just wish this was an SF for our sake.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.420]   All three of us are going back to the city.
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:55.420]   But it's great to be ever.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:56.420]   But it's reverse traffic.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:58.380]   So it's kind of OK.
[02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.380]   Robbie has to drive.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:00.380]   I just sit there and complain.
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:01.380]   That's true.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:02.380]   He does complain.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.380]   You know, I drive.
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:05.140]   I just don't drive an SF because Tina doesn't drive either.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:06.140]   I mean, I have my license.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:07.780]   You're recently a new world millennial.
[02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.740]   Are you going to get your license?
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:11.620]   I don't know.
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:13.140]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:15.020]   It's been a really long time since I've driven.
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.180]   And I'm not very good at it.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.180]   Take a lesson.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:18.500]   Did you ever have a license?
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:19.500]   Yes, I did.
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.300]   OK, so a really long time.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:22.900]   And you just let it expire?
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:24.340]   I just let it expire.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.500]   It was best for everyone that I not drive.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.500]   Maybe it's.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.820]   And that was even before I moved to New York.
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.980]   And then in New York, it was absolutely best for everyone that I not even attempt.
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:35.460]   And so we'll see.
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:39.300]   And public transit, I understand, depending on where we live, it could be pretty good.
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:43.820]   They're depending on where we live, I might be able to have buses take me to the office.
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:44.820]   I don't know.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:45.820]   I'm still figuring it out.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:50.500]   I'm very afraid that in six months time, I might actually have a car.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:53.700]   And then I will be really terrified for everyone on the road with me.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:55.420]   Well, you're going to be in Seattle.
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:59.340]   So the only two cars that are acceptable are either a Prius or a Tesla.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:00.340]   A what?
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:02.140]   Prius, sorry.
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:04.780]   I use the top gear pronunciation for a second there.
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:05.780]   That's OK.
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:06.780]   That's a pretty good slip up.
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:07.780]   I like that.
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:08.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:14.300]   I was saying I've heard from friends that if I get a Prius, they will just donate.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:15.300]   But you're right.
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:18.140]   That's definitely the more affordable option.
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.140]   So we will see.
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.140]   I don't know.
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:21.140]   I like them.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.140]   I like them too.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.140]   I like them too.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:24.140]   They're hybrid.
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:25.140]   I like geeky cars.
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:26.140]   No.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:28.140]   Robbie, what's your day job?
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.300]   No, because it's topical.
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.500]   Oh, my day job?
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:35.980]   I write about cars and motorcycles and transportation.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:38.740]   And yeah, just take a lesson.
[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:39.820]   You'll be fine.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:40.820]   Just take a lesson.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:44.540]   Don't let anyone and don't let your friends or your family members teach you how to drive
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:48.220]   because that always seems to end in tears.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.220]   That's what I hear a lot.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:51.140]   You're saying I shouldn't let my husband.
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.140]   It was--
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:53.140]   Yeah, if you--
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:55.780]   I think it's better you're better off led in a third party.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:59.260]   Just like give you a nice refresher course if you're not concerned.
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:00.980]   And then once you have your license, you don't have to get a car.
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:01.980]   You have a car to go up there.
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:02.980]   They have BMW Reach now.
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:06.860]   They have a lot of really great services where you just drive a car from point A to
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:08.500]   point B and you just leave the car.
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:11.300]   You just walk away from it, which is kind of nice.
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:15.500]   Well, as long as we're talking about you, do you want to do your plug?
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.060]   Let's talk about all your outlets.
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:21.420]   Let's talk about all your work, especially talk about your work with automotive technology
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:25.580]   because there's a few of us here at Twit who love that stuff.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:28.660]   Yeah, so I write about transportation for Engadget.
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.180]   I write a little bit about InfoSec.
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:33.980]   But yeah, the transportation stuff's great because I get to drive cars, drive in Teslas.
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:40.660]   And right now I'm testing the zero motorcycle, their electric bike, the 6.5 kilowatt hour
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:41.660]   bike.
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:42.660]   Ooh.
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:43.660]   So it's electric bike.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:48.100]   If you've ever ridden an electric motorcycle, it's outstanding because it's just torque all
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:49.100]   the time.
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.100]   You can wheelie on that, but you want to do that.
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:54.420]   Yeah, so that's what I write about.
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:57.140]   Do you ride around on electric vehicles in San Francisco?
[02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:58.140]   Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.140]   Really?
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:00.460]   Like a financial district?
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:01.940]   Yeah, I write around in cars.
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:03.540]   I get cars for like a week.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:07.260]   I'll have these more cycles for a few weeks.
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:10.620]   My daily rider is, I have a 250 Vespa.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:12.220]   I just usually get around the city.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:14.420]   Why has a Nissan given you one of their leaves yet?
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:17.580]   Because I know they've been wanting that to catch on in San Francisco.
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:18.580]   I don't know.
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:21.580]   I think, well, it's a little long in the tooth.
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:22.580]   Yeah.
[02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:26.300]   So at some point, you're just reviewing something that's like a year old, a year and a half
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.300]   old.
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:29.220]   So, yeah, you reach out.
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:35.180]   Some automakers, they kind of understand that tech sites are doing more car stuffs.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:36.180]   They reach out a little bit.
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:38.300]   They're a little bit better at reaching out.
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:40.740]   Some of them, not so much.
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:41.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:43.820]   When that's a ride about cars.
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:46.100]   Oh, I have a show coming up for my band.
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:47.100]   Oh.
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:48.100]   So there's a plug.
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:49.100]   Can I plug my band?
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.100]   Oh, wait, what do you play?
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:51.100]   I sing.
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:52.100]   Oh, you sing?
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:53.100]   Yes, I'm a good man.
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:54.100]   He's very good, too.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:55.100]   According to the Alex, I'm very good.
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:56.100]   Wait, where are you playing?
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:57.100]   27th.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.700]   We're doing a 90 show.
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:04.500]   So if you like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, all the Gen X stuff, so you're going to be there.
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:05.500]   Oh, I'll be there.
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.540]   We're doing a US versus UK.
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.820]   We have our friends who are in a UK, a Britpop band.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:13.900]   They're doing, you know, they're doing Oasis, Blur, Pulp.
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:16.020]   We're doing, you know, whole.
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.020]   Definitely whole.
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.020]   Yeah.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:19.020]   We're doing all the US bands.
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.020]   It's going to be fun.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:21.020]   I'm doing Beastie Boys.
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:22.020]   Okay.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:23.020]   Okay.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.020]   If you're doing Beastie Boys, I have to show them.
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:26.100]   And we had to do a last minute change.
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:29.220]   Wait, old Beastie Boys are newer Beastie Boys.
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:30.220]   We're doing sabotage.
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:31.220]   There you go.
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:32.340]   I'll just say, we're doing sabotage, everyone.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:33.340]   Everyone loves that song.
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:34.340]   Amazing.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.340]   We're doing Rage Against the Machine.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:36.340]   We're doing President's United States of America.
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:38.340]   Oh, that's why all that was on the plane.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]   Are you doing Peaches?
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:40.340]   Yeah.
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.340]   So the playlist, because I have to learn all the songs.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.340]   There it is right there.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.340]   There you go.
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:45.500]   All we played on the way up here on the car.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:46.580]   Get your tickets today, folks.
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:47.580]   It's only, what, $10?
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:48.580]   It's $12.
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:51.700]   10 bucks in advance, 12 bucks at the door.
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:55.260]   It's cheap compared to any other thing you're going to do in San Francisco.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:57.260]   It's cheaper than a burrito at this point.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.020]   I don't think I've ever been to the Rick Shaw stop.
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:00.020]   So that's the thing.
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:01.020]   That's amazing.
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:02.020]   That's amazing.
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:03.020]   It's such an amazing place.
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:06.260]   They really care about sound, which is for someone who's in bands.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:07.260]   That's important.
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.420]   But it's a really nice room.
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.420]   It's big.
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:10.420]   They have a bar.
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:11.420]   They have a mezzanine.
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.060]   So you can sit upstairs if you don't want to like dance.
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:14.860]   Is this where I saw your talking head show?
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:15.860]   Yeah.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:16.860]   It's a great venue.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:17.860]   Golf stairs if you can.
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:18.860]   Go upstairs.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:19.860]   It's super chill.
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:20.860]   It's nice.
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:21.860]   Dance.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.860]   I ride a back horse shirt.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:23.860]   Why not?
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:24.860]   Roberto Baldwin.
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:27.660]   He is a tech man and a man of the arts.
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:28.660]   Thank you very much.
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:33.860]   It's been a pleasure to meet you both in person and to have you here for my little hosting
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:34.860]   party.
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:35.940]   I hope you still like us.
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:36.940]   Of course.
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:37.940]   Okay.
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:38.940]   Yeah.
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:42.620]   And of course, Christina, now you're not a tech journalist anymore.
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:45.580]   And I think that should be in your Twitter handle now.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:48.180]   Christina, not a tech journalist anymore.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:51.940]   I know you can't tell us too much about what you're doing at Microsoft other than what
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:52.940]   you tease.
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.940]   But is there anything else you want us to know about what you're doing what you're
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:59.020]   going to be up to other than a one week fun employment?
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:00.020]   What did you do?
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:01.860]   We got one week fun employment slash moving.
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:04.820]   I mean, like, honestly, like it's not really fun.
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:10.340]   It's really all about like packing up my life and us moving across the country.
[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:13.780]   When I would like to plug though in addition to what I will be doing at Microsoft and I'll
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:15.660]   have more to share on that once I learn more about it.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:21.380]   I'll be producing content aimed at developers across different levels for Microsoft Virtual
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:22.380]   Academy.
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:23.380]   So that'll be fun.
[02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:26.780]   And obviously if you guys have suggestions for courses and things you'd like to see,
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:30.460]   let me know because definitely when I engage with the community and create stuff that will
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:31.460]   be informative.
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:38.140]   But I also do a podcast called Rocket on relay FM relay dot FM slash rocket and that
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:40.220]   I do with Briana Wu and Simone de Roche for.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:42.980]   And that's a lot of fun and I'm going to be able to continue doing that.
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:45.380]   So I will still be podcasting.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:49.420]   So even though and I will still be tweeting, especially about the bachelor, the bachelor
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:51.180]   comes back on May 22nd.
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:54.060]   Oh, you are literally my feet on those nights.
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:56.660]   Yeah, I've never seen those shows.
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:59.380]   I've never seen those shows, but I know what's going on.
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:02.660]   I only watch I only watch two shows on TV.
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:06.100]   One is Game of Thrones and another is the expanse.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:08.660]   Oh, the expanse is so good.
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:14.060]   But no, the bachelor comes back and that means that I will be tweeting from a different
[02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:17.260]   time zone, which is bizarre because I will now be spoiled.
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:20.420]   Like like East Coast Twitter is going to ruin the bachelor for me the same way I've
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:23.580]   been doing it for people for the last half of many years.
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.540]   So it is it is Michael Muppens and I'm excited.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:29.300]   Can you can you get an East Coast feed?
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:30.780]   You know what I might be able to.
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:31.780]   I will see.
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:37.300]   I I yeah, I think I think with the VPN and some of those some of the services that I
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:40.260]   subscribe to, I might be able to.
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:45.180]   And of course, Christina, we already have a person on the Microsoft campus in Redmond
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:49.420]   who does have a weekly show on the Twit TV network, Lou Maresca.
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:51.940]   And I have no idea where you'll be in relation to him.
[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:55.300]   But at some point the two of you will probably bump into each other because there's only
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.180]   what a few thousand 10s of.
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:58.940]   Like 60,000 of us.
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:15:59.940]   No, I would love that.
[02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:01.860]   I would love love love to love to meet Lou.
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:04.500]   I'm trying to meet as many people as I can.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.500]   We were kind of going to Seattle.
[02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:08.820]   We're kind of like, I have some friends there, but it's not the same sort of situation.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:12.700]   So if anybody in Seattle hit me up, I'm film girl at Twitter.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:14.300]   I'd love to like have coffee.
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:15.940]   Get to know any of you.
[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:16.940]   I need friends.
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:17.940]   Yeah.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:18.940]   Yeah.
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:20.740]   You come friends to Frank Shuttown friends.
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:22.180]   Christina Warren, thank you very much.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:27.020]   Now, I want to do something right now and it's not because I've completely forgot to do
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.180]   it until now.
[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:30.140]   It's because I wanted to do these back to back.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:34.740]   But in case you haven't been watching Twit, here's what you missed.
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:36.100]   Previously on Twit.
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:37.100]   Sophie has come back.
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:38.100]   Yes.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:40.100]   We have tips and tricks.
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:41.980]   Oh, she's so adorable.
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:42.980]   Walk.
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:50.220]   Daniel Suarez is here.
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:53.580]   It feels like every couple of years I'm going to get you back with a new book.
[02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:56.980]   This new one, Change Engine, which just came out as the first one that is in the future.
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:57.980]   This is a warning that it could be.
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:16:58.980]   It is an admonition.
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.540]   Pointing people on notice that Silicon Valley will decamp if it needs to.
[02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:06.100]   The brilliant minds there might go elsewhere.
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:08.340]   So we have to treat science seriously.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:10.300]   We have to be evidence based in our thinking.
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:13.060]   You don't get to the moon by going like this.
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:14.860]   Do the math.
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:15.860]   Windows Weekly.
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:21.060]   Mary J. Foley and Paul Therat are here with some special guests from Microsoft Build
[02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:22.060]   Conference.
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:26.540]   What you see in Story Remix, we've done deep machine learning on all sorts of sets of
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:30.860]   video and photos so we can understand not just, oh, there's a person in here.
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:35.780]   Then we can take all that data, put it through our AI system, and tell the story for you
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:40.380]   if you don't have the time or the inclination to learn how to use a tool to it.
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:43.500]   Tech just like you like it.
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.660]   Sophie wants out.
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:47.100]   I tried to offer her out beforehand.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:49.820]   I told her she was not going to enjoy it, but she would not go.
[02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:52.540]   For a warning, Sophie, we're starting a podcast.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.100]   You might be a little bored.
[02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:58.180]   It lasts forever.
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.580]   So that's what you've missed.
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:02.060]   And we've got Jason Howell with the week ahead.
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.700]   Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be watching in the week ahead.
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:12.300]   On Tuesday, May 16th, HTC is holding an event teased as Squeeze for the Brilliant.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:18.060]   Apparently, that refers to the rumored HTC U11 that is expected to include a feature
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:23.540]   called Edge Sense that puts touch sensors into the frame of the phone that allows users
[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:28.580]   to squeeze and swipe the sides of the phone for different interactivity elements.
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:29.580]   Trying something new.
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:34.140]   On Wednesday, May 17th, Google I/O kicks off at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View,
[02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:35.140]   California.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:39.180]   Google is expected to dish out new features to Android O, Google Play updates, and of
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:43.580]   course, developers in attendance get to fill their minds with all things Googly.
[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:46.980]   I'll be there, so I'm sure I'll have some insight to share from the event throughout
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:47.980]   the week.
[02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:53.580]   On Thursday, May 18th, the FCC will put up a vote on restoring internet freedom in a
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:59.220]   move that signals FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's determination to move net neutrality rules
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:01.540]   out of FCC's jurisdiction.
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:04.500]   That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.820]   Join Meghan Moroni and me on Tech News Today, every weekday at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern
[02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:11.300]   here on Twit.TV.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:13.780]   Thanks, Jason.
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:14.780]   I appreciate that.
[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:19.740]   And folks, don't forget that you can find us here every Sunday starting at 3pm Pacific
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:20.740]   time.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.980]   Not like Leo, I can't just rattle off UTC, but just work backwards and forwards from
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:24.980]   there.
[02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:30.300]   Again, thanks to our panel, Christina, Roberto, and the man whose name is too close to the
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:33.860]   Amazon voice assistant to say on the stream.
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:34.860]   Thank you very much for being here.
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:35.860]   Thank you.
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:37.060]   Thank you for coming up.
[02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:41.340]   It's not easy coming up to Pataluma from San Francisco as we get closer to the summer
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:43.140]   because then we get all the summer traffic.
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.140]   It's okay.
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:45.140]   It wasn't bad.
[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:46.660]   Also, you used those more to get us here.
[02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:49.420]   If you did this studio at SF, it'd be like this time in my apartment, we'd all be on
[02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:51.180]   the same chair, you know, big bed.
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:52.180]   Sit on chairs, laps.
[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:53.180]   Yeah.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:55.340]   That's not awkward at all.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:20:00.820]   Also thanks to Carson Bondi, our super producer, to Lisa and Leo, who actually let me do this.
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:04.380]   Hopefully they're coming back from Colorado in the near future because Leo, we miss you,
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:06.220]   we need you back.
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:07.220]   Anything else?
[02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:08.220]   Do we want to have any shout outs?
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:09.220]   Especially to our audience.
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:10.220]   Yeah.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:14.260]   We actually have an in studio audience and they braved what happens in Pataluma to come
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:16.700]   and watch the unfolding of tech news.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:18.140]   What happens in Pataluma?
[02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.540]   We have chickens.
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:23.700]   To quote the song, it goes down in the DM, I think.
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:24.700]   I don't know.
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:25.700]   Yeah.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:26.700]   Pataluma.
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:27.700]   We really do have chickens.
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:28.700]   We have the chicken and egg parade.
[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:29.700]   I think I need to get out of here.
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:30.700]   Wait, Jim or B?
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:34.260]   We have American graffiti days or graffiti days coming up.
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:36.100]   Like classic cars.
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:40.340]   They reenact that scene from American graffiti where they pull the back ax a lot of a police
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:41.340]   car.
[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:42.340]   It's kind of fun actually.
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:43.340]   Oh, I like how scumples.
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:44.340]   Tell me about that.
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.340]   You should come up.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:46.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.700]   I'll have the first title.
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:48.700]   Wow.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:50.140]   That predates me a little bit.
[02:20:50.140 --> 02:20:54.140]   Well, obviously I've got some skeptics here and with that, another twit.
[02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:55.140]   It's amazing.
[02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.140]   Is it the cat?
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:21:04.580]   I'm on the twit.
