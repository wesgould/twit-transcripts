[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   It's time for "Twit This Week" at Tech.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.080]   Great in-studio panel.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.520]   Jason Heiner is here.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.400]   Mike Elgin and Liz Gaines is back.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.520]   And we're going to talk about the latest tech news,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.640]   including a good story about fiber.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.760]   And I want to give credit for our show title today
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.240]   to Mike Masnick of Tech Dirt for a great line.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.480]   We'll explain what fiber to the press release means.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.280]   We'll also talk about Apple.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.840]   Augmented reality, maybe a little bit more sober.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360]   Look at that from our panel this week.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.560]   And a lot more.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   On "Twit."
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.600]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.320]   to show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.840]   Oh, I am so excited today, because not only do we
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.440]   have fancy eyewear for the show, because I don't know why
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.560]   Valentine's Day is Tuesday.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   But we have an all-in-studio panel.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   And when we have an all-in-studio panel,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   I think the show kind of is more fun.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   Starting with Jason Heiner from Tech Republic at CBS Interactive.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   Hey, Jason.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.600]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.040]   Looking good in those shades.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.440]   Thank you.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   Appreciate that.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.280]   I can take these with me, right?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.200]   They're yours to keep.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.640]   Excellent.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.040]   They're highly non-functional classes.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   They're terrible.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.360]   That voice is somebody we haven't had on an age.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080]   And I'm so glad to have Liz Gaines back.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.580]   Sorry.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.400]   You can put them on.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.800]   Put them on.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.300]   Put them on.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.140]   You're wearing the picture.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.640]   You're wearing the picture.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.600]   Yeah, that's even better.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.040]   That's much more lovely.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.360]   Liz is now formally at recode.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.480]   We've known Liz for a long time.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   Had a baby since I saw your last "How old's your baby?"
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.640]   She's almost a year.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.840]   Wow.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.240]   Yeah, it's been a while.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.640]   Did a journalism fellowship at Stanford, which sounds really cool.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   She says she's a little percuss.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   She came to some classes.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.100]   She asked Connelliza Rice a couple questions.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.660]   Did she really?
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.260]   No, she slept.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.700]   Babies love the name Connelliza.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.660]   They love it.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.420]   And now is at a coincidentally at a site--
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.460]   well, maybe it's not a coincidence.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.260]   It's called 60 dB at 6erodb.co.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.460]   And I think it was Matthew Ingram, your former colleague,
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.180]   I think.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.420]   Matthew Ingram, maybe not.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.460]   We worked together at Giggum.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.660]   Giggum, yeah.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.620]   Who said, oh, you got to try the 60 dB.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.780]   I don't know if you knew you were there.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.260]   He didn't mention you.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.500]   And so I was listening to it.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.100]   And there's Liz Gaines doing interviews and stuff.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500]   I said, Liz!
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.260]   So I was really pleased.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.580]   We've plugged this a couple of times,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.180]   because I think it's a great app.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.380]   It's a great website.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.100]   But more importantly for me, it's an echo skill.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.940]   And I--
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.580]   It's a voice interface for life to get you news forever.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.140]   Yeah, so it's like kind of like reintroducing the podcast,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.780]   in a way, to the normals who don't listen to podcasts.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.700]   Well, yeah.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.940]   I mean, can I quickly describe what it is?
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.660]   Let me introduce Mike, and then I'll have you do that.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.180]   Mike Elgin--
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.980]   I don't want Mike sitting near cool in his heels.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.380]   Mike Elgin is also here, elgin.com and becoming nomad.com.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.780]   Yes.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.020]   Still hasn't left the country.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.780]   I'm not pushing you out.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.540]   But I'm afraid I won't be able to get back in.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.900]   You had a beautiful granddaughter.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.540]   Yes.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.420]   Princess Quiskey face.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.780]   Yes.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.340]   Love Princess Quiskey face.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.420]   Going to Venice in April.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.820]   So that's--
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.740]   Is that where you're going to end up?
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.100]   That's where we're going to start.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.860]   And we're going to probably bum around Europe for--
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.380]   Why ever leave Venice?
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.300]   How come Mike's got two pairs of glasses?
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.860]   I'm special.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.860]   He's got mine.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.020]   One is for this.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.180]   I'm just going to--
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.740]   It's a very executive.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.940]   You look very prophysoirially.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.780]   Professional.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.260]   You bite on your Valentine's Day weird glasses.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.220]   Although these have--
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.180]   Not only non-functional, is they actually--
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.100]   They impair your--
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.740]   They're bad.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.620]   What's the point of these?
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.180]   I don't understand.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.740]   They're bad.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.820]   So anyway, good to have you.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.400]   Thank you.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.900]   And good luck in Venice.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.620]   Thank you.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.740]   I always-- when I go to Venice, the beautiful Italian town
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.580]   that's floating, I think it must be hard to live here,
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.980]   like harder even than Manhattan.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.620]   Because you have to walk everywhere
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.020]   or take a boat.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.260]   Shopping must be murder.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.420]   On one of those little boats with the bags?
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.500]   That'll be horrible.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.820]   People who live in Venice really want to live there.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.220]   Well, we tell they have self-driving gondolas.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.700]   It's going to be a totally different thing.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.300]   It's going to change everything.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.860]   So tell us about 60 DB lists, as long as we've
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.940]   got that conversation started.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.180]   Because to me, this is kind of the next step in--
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.100]   Podcasting started.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.220]   60 DB takes over from it, I think.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.580]   Podcasting is great, but there's
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.620]   all sorts of other ways that you want to listen to audio.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.180]   And it doesn't have to be an hour long conversation
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.300]   between a couple of people.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.100]   That's just one way.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.820]   Those are great.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.580]   But I heard the stat in our pitch deck the other day
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.700]   that terrestrial radio has 90 million more
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.620]   weekly active users than Facebook.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.660]   So there is something bigger than Facebook.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.620]   And it's people listening to stuff.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.580]   And so yeah, 60 DB is a personalized playlist of news.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.900]   So instead of getting in your car and listening
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.980]   to radio technology that has not changed in forever,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.740]   that's you turn into one channel, you're
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.260]   10 minutes late for their show.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.860]   So what?
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.660]   You're not interested.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.060]   So what?
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.860]   This is just a personalized playlist
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.780]   of usually five to seven minute clips.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.780]   So it's a show that's edited for you.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.420]   And then--
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.420]   And it never stops.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.660]   It's kind of an endless--
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.700]   And you ask Alexa to start 60 DB again,
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.340]   and you keep on going with your channel.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.460]   I'm sorry to interrupt, Leo.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.740]   But does it automatically customize
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.240]   itself?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.740]   You customize it.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.780]   Yeah, it's like Tinder.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.940]   He swiped, and then you hear--
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.260]   No.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.740]   Really?
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.740]   That's great.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.420]   I can swipe.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.420]   Yeah, you can say next.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.900]   And we--
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.420]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.820]   And on the echo, you can say next.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.100]   Yeah, like if you--
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.540]   so that was a long way to explain it.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.220]   But another way to say is like our founders
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.740]   came from Netflix and NPR.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.260]   So what is Netflix plus NPR?
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.700]   Right.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.660]   And it's personalized radio.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.020]   And you do when you first sign up,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.540]   there's an onboarding experience
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.540]   where you pick categories that you're interested in.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.220]   And like you get exposed to stuff you would never hear on the radio.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.820]   I had a barbecue podcast the other day.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.060]   And I was like, this is awesome.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.420]   I've never heard this on the news.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.020]   I'm much more educated on sports and markets
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.700]   and all sorts of things than I would normally be.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.340]   I just signed up while we were doing it.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.300]   Well, it's free.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.660]   What's the monetization strategy?
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.020]   You're going to put ads in there?
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.900]   What is the--
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.220]   You're doing content for this, too.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.460]   You're doing unique content for it.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.100]   I mean, I think we don't have this yet.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.180]   Who needs that?
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.420]   How does Netflix make money?
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.900]   Right.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.780]   We're probably going to do that.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.460]   I would subscribe.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.740]   I'd pay for this, absolutely.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.020]   And by the way, tWIP bits are on here, show up on here.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.520]   So--
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.180]   They come up in my feed a couple times a week.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   Yeah, we're having a good time.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.820]   So are you optimizing for some size?
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.100]   Look, so here's quick hits.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.820]   These are five to 10 minutes, right?
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.220]   Or even shorter sometimes.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.580]   And then in depth is longer.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.620]   So we do both.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.940]   We're getting better at doing in depth.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.820]   Because I think at first we were like,
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.020]   people don't realize that short form is great.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.500]   But then it turned out that most people who
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.580]   download early adopters tend to already
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.780]   know about digital audio.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.820]   So we have to be a good podcast app, too.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.220]   So now we're going to be both short form and podcast.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.420]   We actually--
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.620]   I would really think of yourself as a podcast app.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.580]   But you don't want to switch apps just to listen to something
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.300]   longer.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.620]   So we're trying to give you both of those.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.780]   And actually, we had a redesign go live on Saturday
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.820]   that has both of them now.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.220]   Oh, interesting.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.300]   The UI was really good.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.460]   I just signed up just while we were talking about this.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.380]   And I was in, used my Twitter account,
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.340]   gave my email, and picked three things.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.100]   And then--
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.820]   So yeah.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.020]   And you can put a app on your phone
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.620]   so you get in the car.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.580]   You can listen on the app.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.820]   But you can also do it on your Echo, which to me
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.620]   is mostly hell.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.020]   I get up in the morning, I say.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.540]   And hopefully, cars will have voice interfaces soon.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.900]   I mean, our technology is never as fast as you want it.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.060]   I think you're really onto something,
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.860]   because not interacting with the app while I'm listening
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.940]   is really important to me.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.660]   Because I'm usually cooking or doing dishes,
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.940]   or I'm taking a hike or something.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.740]   Well, some of the inspiration for this is the NPR One.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.500]   NPR had this insight originally with their app,
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.220]   where you would just say, listen,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.980]   and it would play your NPR shows one after the other.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.020]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.620]   And pretty similar.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:07.980]   What limited?
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.500]   We have a bit more variety, right?
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.860]   Because NPR is--
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:10.940]   NPR is--
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.300]   NPR is--
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.780]   NPR is a real content content.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.900]   I use the NPR One app.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.140]   So actually, just--
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.020]   and I've heard a 6D TV, but had downloaded it yet.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.860]   Yeah, check it out.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.300]   We're brand new, but I think it's actually really good
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.180]   for being a three-month-old product.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.820]   And you're working as a journalist for them.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.540]   You're doing journalism.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.020]   Thank you for letting me talk so much about it.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.300]   I would be happy to tell you.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.260]   Yeah, I'm helping places like The Atlantic or Wired
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.100]   or Politico create more audio content.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.540]   And then it fits into our feed, because they write great stories.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.700]   But not everyone wants to read stories.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.460]   And hopefully, they'll start doing that themselves.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.860]   I also do some more original stuff.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.020]   I really wanted to cover the AI versus humans poker
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.540]   tournaments.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.660]   So I found a reporter who went to that and called them.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.420]   I wanted to cover the Hyperloop competition.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.860]   So I found a reporter who went to that.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.420]   So sometimes I'm driving it too.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.900]   Because that journalistic instinct
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.660]   is really important, I think, to giving it
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.900]   a full stack of stuff.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.380]   Thank you.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.540]   Yeah, like the idea of engaging other journalists
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.380]   and stuff that they're doing.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.140]   And it turned these into audio stories, too,
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.220]   because I've lost count of how many times we've
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.260]   started a podcast.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.700]   And it always peters out after a year.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.860]   But we know that it's a good way to engage the audience.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.380]   And so I think there's a market there
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.700]   for engage with publishers and turn more of what they do
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.180]   into audio stories.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.340]   We'd have to be insane to get into the podcast.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.940]   You would say.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.500]   What's actually not about that?
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.140]   Oh, I'll bet you.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.980]   No, I kick myself that I didn't think of this,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.260]   because we have the skill to put together audio feeds.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.420]   But there are a lot of people.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.660]   And we get approached frequently by people like Tech Republic.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.100]   But others who say, hey, we want to do a show.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.340]   You know how to do this.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.980]   How do we do it?
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.140]   Could we partner with you?
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.700]   This is actually a better way to do it.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.300]   And frankly, there's a monetization plan.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.260]   I don't know if that's one that you're considering.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.020]   But the ability to put the Atlantic on the radio
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.420]   has got to be valuable to them.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.940]   They don't have a-- actually, they do have podcasts.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.580]   But they don't push.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.300]   But not port stuff.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.100]   Yeah, a lot of places don't have.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.820]   And reporters don't realize how easy it is
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.820]   to talk about their stuff.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.020]   If you have somebody like you on that side.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.580]   And so I call them like five minutes after they finish the story.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.660]   It's fresh in their head.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.220]   And they can tell me a few stats.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.260]   I can edit in a few clips.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.860]   I am a month into being an audio producer.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.940]   So I'm getting faster at it.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.700]   Yeah, I've been working some nights.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.140]   But hopefully, I'll get quick at it.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.460]   Neat.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.940]   Well, that's a big plug for 6DDB.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.220]   But I think it's worth plugging, because I think this--
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.460]   and it doesn't really help us particularly.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.140]   We'd far prefer you use our apps or listen on our website
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.140]   and hear the whole show.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.700]   But at least it's an introduction of people
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.540]   who have never heard "Twit."
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.540]   They can hear a short bit and say, oh.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.460]   Yeah, that will bring you an audio.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.420]   That's why we make "Twit Bits," right?
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.660]   We make them and we put them on YouTube
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.620]   so that people can down-- or in our website,
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.980]   so people can download something quick
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.260]   and kind of get a sense of what they might be hearing.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.540]   With the three hour episode, which we're about to do.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.700]   Oh, is that it?
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.860]   Well, we just spent half an hour on 6DDB.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.300]   I think it's getting longer all the time.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.420]   I'm going to try it on my way back to the city.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.180]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.140]   It's really fun.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.700]   I actually wanted to ask you, Mike,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   because you wrote a good article.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.100]   Where was that?
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.660]   Was it "Pewterworld"?
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.300]   Where did you write that?
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.100]   About Twitter?
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:12.700]   Yes.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.100]   Yes.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.940]   "Commuterworld."
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.700]   I just read that this morning.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.500]   Twitter announced this week that they are going to--
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.860]   A couple of things happened.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.060]   First of all, Twitter had its financial results.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.580]   Yes.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.380]   Not good.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.180]   They weren't great.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.380]   They only had 2 million new users in a three month period.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.140]   And I can test that.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.620]   Well, I don't know how many of those are fake or lost.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.260]   I would bet half of those, as is often the case with Twitter,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.940]   are spam or fake accounts.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.300]   So a million, maybe, compare that to what was it?
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.140]   83 million that Facebook got in the same quarter.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.620]   And they have done nothing.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.420]   Going back to their previous CEO, Dick Costello, who said,
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.100]   it's on me.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.180]   We haven't done a good job dealing with abuse.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.100]   We've done a terrible job.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.220]   We're going to do it better.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.420]   And they haven't.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.380]   And now you've got Jack.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.620]   They tried to find a buyer, Jack Dorsey, the CEO.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.940]   Apparently, interested F Williams, one of the founders,
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.140]   not interested.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.500]   Nevertheless, the board encouraged them to find a buyer.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.340]   Was it the other way around?
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.540]   I've wanted to sell and Jack didn't.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.500]   I can't remember.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.820]   But nobody will buy it.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.740]   It's a toxic brand.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.260]   Because I think that's the problem.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.740]   It's the harassment.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.820]   To point that in your article, that no advertiser
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.060]   wants to be in an environment where you don't know what's going on.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.860]   You don't want to be sandwiched between two bits of hate speech.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.380]   Right.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.820]   You don't want your brand there being a--
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.980]   But Twitter's-- well, go ahead and say it.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.300]   Twitter's going to say Twitter's never been more relevant.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.300]   Exactly.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:31.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.380]   It should.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.020]   We need it.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.180]   Desperately, I'm so afraid that they're
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.340]   going to fail and fail and fail.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.940]   And then they're going to sell it to some company that's
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.220]   going to strip it for parts and just milk it for all its worth.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.860]   And it's going to be this lost opportunity.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.460]   Well, then that was even the rumor
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.620]   is that some hedge fund or investment group would buy it
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.220]   and do exactly that.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.540]   What you really want is almost a journalistic entity
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.060]   to buy it, right?
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.100]   No, my fantasy is that some well-meaning billionaire buys it
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.740]   as a pet pot--
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   Jeff Bezos, Jeff.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.420]   He says, well, maybe-- well-meaning, I said.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.140]   I think Jeff's done pretty well with the Washington Post.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:07.980]   He really has.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.980]   He's done a great job with that.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.780]   I think he deserves credit.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.580]   Yeah, and he does have his own space program,
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.380]   so respect for the Bezos.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:21.580]   But see, I wanted to continue to be what it is minus the harassment.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.220]   And there's one thing that they do
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.980]   that they refuse to change that I think is the whole problem.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.780]   And it's this.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.020]   So if you go to Facebook, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.460]   every social network except Twitter,
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.340]   if somebody replies to something you post, you can delete it.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   Twitter has refused to do that.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.940]   So if somebody who hates speech is a reply to my thing,
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.740]   I can't do anything--
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   I can actually delete it.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.300]   I can't delete theirs.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.340]   But you can delete it from other sites.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.580]   From every other site.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.260]   Every other site.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.500]   And that's why Twitter has a special reputation
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.300]   for harassment, because there's nothing--
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.620]   you have to go ahead and hand to Twitter and say, please,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.740]   please remove this person.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.940]   They're clearly a troll.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.900]   The whole account is nothing about her except harassment.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.180]   But then every time you build an anti-harassment feature,
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.180]   they build a better harasser.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.100]   So they figure out how to get around these things.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.380]   They say, oh, somebody should kill you.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.820]   There's a technical issue with this.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.540]   That's the same reason they don't add edit.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.900]   Everybody says, oh, you should be able to edit your talk.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.220]   But the problem is that with Twitter, once a tweet goes out,
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.900]   deleting it doesn't really delete it.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.300]   Because there's third party programs, there's databases,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.260]   there's the Library of Freak in Congress.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.580]   There's people archiving Twitter all the time.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.700]   So once somebody should tell the US government that--
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.940]   you put a tweet out.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.340]   It's there, permanently.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.060]   Right.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.180]   So you could delete-- I guess it'd be better than nothing.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.780]   They've announced some initiatives this week.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.740]   One of them.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.220]   Three of them.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.180]   Tell us about the three initiatives.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.940]   OK, so one of them is that they remove problematic results
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.900]   from search.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.700]   If people are tweeting something that's harassment or hate speech
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.700]   or low quality content, and you search for it,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.860]   you can't find it.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.740]   It won't show up in search.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.740]   And they base that on the wrong criteria.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.260]   The criteria that they use is if somebody's
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.380]   been blocked by a lot of people or muted by a lot of people,
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.460]   their posts are coming.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.380]   Humans are better at this than the machines.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:24.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.180]   This is your point in the article.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.620]   Humans are better than machines at this.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.740]   At understanding the nuances of language,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.500]   but to the search point, now this becomes a source of harassment.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.180]   So for example, lots of people have blocked you, Leo.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.700]   And now you're not going to show up in search results.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.500]   And so now--
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.580]   Because Twitter will misinterpret that signal
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.180]   as an opt-on--
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.740]   It's on the signal.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.660]   Because the--
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.500]   And the haters--
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.340]   It will not be better.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.100]   What would be better would be for everything
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.980]   to show up in search results.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.180]   And then every tweet or every reply to your tweets
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.100]   has two buttons.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.340]   One is delete this reply--
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.900]   For me, for my two.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.900]   But it deletes reply for everybody.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.980]   Nobody else can see it.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.260]   And third party issues and so on.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.260]   There's a comment thread instead.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.620]   It's like every other social network.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.940]   On Facebook, if somebody replies to something you post,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.380]   you can go in.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.820]   There's a menu item that say delete this.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.660]   And it goes away.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.740]   And it really does go away because it doesn't have third party
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.340]   clients.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.220]   You don't have a history.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.100]   You don't have search.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.820]   Exactly.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.300]   So it does.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.700]   It can.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.220]   Twitter.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.260]   But even if it continues to persist on third party clients,
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.780]   it's still on the main side.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.180]   Twitter, we have to kill the API or modify it.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.260]   I don't really know what percentage of people
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.060]   are getting on the app or on the site or whatever.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.260]   But that would be one thing.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.220]   And the other one would be delete this reply
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.380]   and block the user.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.460]   And then block should have more juice than it currently does.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.060]   But that's really the secret sauce.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.220]   Now, what they propose is to make it harder for people
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.820]   to recreate serial accounts of an abuser.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.660]   By the way, I don't know how they're going to do that.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:01.020]   Because we have abusers who use spoofing and so forth.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.220]   It's almost impossible.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.860]   They create a new email address, spoof the IP address.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.500]   How do you know it's the same person coming back?
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.700]   So think about this.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.220]   Let's say a janitor comes in here and uses your guest
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.780]   network to harass somebody.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.100]   They shut down your IP address.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.300]   And nobody, no guest, no employee.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   You, nobody can tweet or set up accounts.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.820]   That's a problem.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.220]   I don't know how they're going to do that.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.140]   So somehow they're going to identify people who've been
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.540]   suspended and stop them from creating new accounts.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.100]   If they could do that, that would be helpful.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.700]   That only, in my opinion, that works
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.580]   most with people like Milo Janopoulos, who was anonymous.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.300]   You can say Milo, you can't create an anonymous account.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.860]   He may have created an anonymous account.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.220]   But he can't create a new account on his own name.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.700]   Right.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.180]   There's a reputation aspect to it.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.100]   But that's a small number of people.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.900]   I mean, the vast majority of trolling
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.300]   happens because you can do it anywhere.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.940]   And your reply shows up no matter whether you built a
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.100]   reputation or not.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.660]   The simple solution to that is pseudonymity, where Twitter
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.460]   knows who you are.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.900]   You have Twitter who you are.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.020]   And then you can have any public name you want.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.100]   And then they should have an option that says, you know what?
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.980]   I don't want to hear from anybody who's anonymous.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.860]   Unless I follow them or--
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.580]   We were told they were going to do that.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.580]   They were starting to--
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.380]   Expanded verification.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.620]   But they apparently abandoned that.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.020]   We mentioned removing from search results and the problem
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.220]   with that.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.700]   They also say maybe they'll collapse or hide
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.540]   objectionable replies.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.420]   Which is a useless feature because it's again head in the
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.820]   sands type of attitude that Twitter has already had.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.380]   If there's low quality content-- and by the way, there are
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.820]   search algorithms, their software is going to misfire on
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.140]   this, as it does on every other social network.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.980]   On Google+, like 10% of the things that they hide are
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.100]   perfectly good content.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.500]   And 10% of the garbage they allow.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.620]   So it's hard to do this well.
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.500]   It's hard to do it well.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.860]   If Google can't do it, I doubt Twitter.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.460]   They hide it from me.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.300]   And if I unhide it or hide it, it only affects what I see.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.380]   That's my biggest problem.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.860]   They've proposed this.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.700]   They always say, if you complain about some of it, just
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.220]   mute them.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:00.860]   Just block them.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.820]   Then you won't see it.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.900]   But that's not the problem.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.980]   I don't care about seeing it.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.140]   It's about other people seeing it.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.300]   It's a problem.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.860]   I think the way to use social media is that my profile on
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.260]   any social site should be a place where I start
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.140]   conversations and I cultivate conversations.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.180]   And I can make sure that people don't derail those
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   conversations.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.980]   That's the problem.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.780]   Derum, the S posting--
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.860]   I don't know if I want to say the full word--
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.740]   where you throw a bunch of garbage.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.020]   People having constructive political conversation.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.660]   And a bunch of haters come in and start screaming at
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.900]   everybody.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.780]   The point of that is to make sure nobody can have a
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.780]   conversation.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.700]   You can just delete those people and just keep the
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.460]   rational people.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.780]   Then you can have a conversation.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.260]   And that should be controlled by each individual
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:41.260]   problem.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.900]   In our chatroom, Web 6858, not as real name, says,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.020]   just leave Twitter alone.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.380]   And people who don't like it can go to Facebook or some
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:48.980]   other service.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.900]   That's the lead Britney alone guy who's now moved on to
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.860]   Twitter alone.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.500]   I think there's a couple of things, though, to keep in
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.420]   mind with this.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.100]   And I think Mike's point is Mike's poking the holes in what
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.860]   Twitter's doing and that's perfectly valid.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.980]   I think there's a couple of things that keep in mind.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.980]   One is that this pretty much happens to every social
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.700]   network, every community.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.420]   Over time, it's almost like a law of nature that they get
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.780]   worse and communities reach this point where they get
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.660]   really bad.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.980]   But Facebook hasn't.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.980]   For the exact reason we talk about you have to be you, it's
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.900]   very hard to have a fake account.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.380]   Real names policy makes a difference.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.780]   And it makes a difference.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.980]   But also the thing that makes Twitter great, it's like when
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.180]   you fall in love with someone and you realize their best
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.180]   quality is also their worst quality, right?
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.180]   It's the same thing with Twitter.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.380]   That's an interesting philosophy.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.180]   It's best quality is its openness, right?
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.980]   It's also its worst.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.740]   Evan Williams made this thing.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.100]   And he went to bat very early on.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.180]   The free speech wing of the free speech party is what he's
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.780]   saying.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.180]   Yes, yes.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.500]   He very much went to bat for the openness of this platform
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.380]   early on.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.500]   And the openness is still at strength and it's also its
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:01.980]   weakness.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.660]   And I don't know.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.100]   I think the one thing that has the best chance of solving
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:13.700]   this is what you're talking about is the fact that they want
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:19.020]   to, if they follow through with opening it up to the people
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.380]   who want to get verified, and then they give precedence to
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.060]   those.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.260]   Use a real names policy in the side door.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.060]   Yeah, expand the notion of verification from public figures
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.460]   to people who are willing to be themselves.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:32.860]   Yes.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.780]   I feel like though the better comparison and not to say they
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.100]   figured it out would be Reddit, right?
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.100]   Like Reddit is Twitter in a discussion board form.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.620]   And so it's--
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.420]   They're struggling big times.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.140]   Well, absolutely.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.700]   But they reputation matters then because it's a continuous
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.420]   discussion rather than its own--
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.340]   And they have car money.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.180]   They have voting.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.340]   In fact, the voting works quite well to hide a lot of the junk
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.860]   unless you go to a subreddit around junk and then nobody
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.860]   downvotes it because this is what we're here for.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.300]   And on Reddit, you can pick.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.900]   You can go to the trollies, trollers, hateful speech.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.940]   But you don't have to.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.860]   It's voluntary.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.940]   And everything's segregated.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.780]   The problem with Twitter is that it's open.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.260]   One thing great.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.660]   Everything is wide open.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.140]   The thing that I think Jack, the mistake I make, that he makes,
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:21.540]   I think, is that the problematic tweets are problematic
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.540]   precisely because they stifle free speech.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.460]   Harassing people, silencing women,
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.860]   doing all those things that the haters do,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.460]   that's actually ending free speech, not promoting it.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.820]   Allowing somebody to derail conversations
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.300]   when people trying to have constructive conversation
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.420]   does not promote free speech.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.340]   And that's why there's no substitute for letting people
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.180]   choose themselves.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.060]   Now, if I delete somebody's comment,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.180]   he wants to go dis me on their profile
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.500]   or on somebody else's comment thread, great.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.020]   Right.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.940]   That's fine.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.540]   But I'm trying to have a good conversation here.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.580]   And I should go with the Twitter.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.300]   Not letting it hijack.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:57.860]   You should.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:57.860]   Exactly.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.340]   That's the problem with the platform
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.220]   is it does let other people hijack the conversation.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.900]   I also wonder, whether you should really
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.020]   be having conversations on Twitter, I just
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.060]   thought it's a terrible platform for conversation.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.980]   Yeah, I've--
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.100]   Liz, why should we save Twitter?
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.140]   Well, I think we're having this conversation.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.780]   And it's great in this little world that we live in.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.340]   We're in Donald Trump hasn't been mentioned,
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.260]   but Donald Trump needs to be mentioned, right?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.060]   And this is where the discourse of our world is happening.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.940]   We should save it for the president.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.260]   We should save it for the president.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.700]   Did you know that now Jimmy Fallon does an impression
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.260]   of Alec Baldwin doing an impression of Donald Trump?
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.900]   All my impressions are of people
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.460]   doing impressions of the person I'm
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.100]   impressing because it's easier.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.660]   It's impressive.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.700]   It's impressive, I know.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:42.980]   I don't know.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.300]   Maybe their monetization model can be like all the people
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.540]   in the world who have now set up mobile notifications
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.740]   for whenever Donald Trump tweets to find out
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.820]   if their world is falling up.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.340]   It's kind of important, actually.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.820]   You're right.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.260]   What's interesting is every president going back to FDR
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.180]   has wanted to wait to directly address the electorate.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.140]   FDR did "Fire Side Chats," the brand new medium of radio.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.500]   He used it masterfully, right?
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.860]   In fact, presidents still do radio addresses.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.500]   I don't know if Trump has done that, but up until Trump,
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.300]   everybody was doing radio addresses.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.780]   Everyone wants to find a way to talk to the people directly.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.660]   And this is-- I mean, he's a master of this medium.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.860]   I mean, he's arguably one of the reasons he got elected
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.300]   is his mastery of Twitter.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.980]   But yeah, it's a two-edged sword, though.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.140]   One of the biggest things I've ever written
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.180]   was actually for "Recode."
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:28.940]   I wrote it for medium.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.220]   "Recode" picked-- asked if they could repost it.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.900]   But it was how to get into the filter bubble of people
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.220]   who are fans of Trump.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.140]   And that is simply that if you can
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.740]   post a reply to his tweets within five seconds--
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.180]   You'll hear.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.820]   His fans will see it.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.140]   And so this is a powerful thing.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.580]   I mean, when the president posts something,
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.980]   he has direct access to 20, whatever million people.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:59.180]   And then those people see the resistance come flooding in.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.580]   And so it's a double-edged sword for him.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.900]   Yes, he gets to talk to everybody.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   But he also has to be exposed to every single post he has,
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.420]   followed by thousands of people slamming and criticizing him.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.460]   And so you--
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.140]   That's the game.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.820]   And I presume this is not @potus.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.500]   This is @realdonaldtrump that you're talking about.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.820]   When I wrote it, he wasn't president yet.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.620]   So if you look at the tweets, you see his tweets.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.180]   But if you go to tweets and replies, which I'm not going to do--
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.820]   Or if you click on one of the tweets individually.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.180]   Yeah, you'll see--
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.380]   It's like 4chan in there.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.240]   I don't know.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.580]   Is that a valuable discussion?
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.980]   I don't think that forwards anything.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.820]   I don't think it's a valuable discussion.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.980]   But I think that the whole Trump phenomenon
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.780]   is separate from the issue of harassment in general.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.260]   The thing that concerns me about harassment
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.260]   is when people make the decision where they're
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.620]   trying to have a voice, and they get to the point where,
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.220]   like, you know what?
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.980]   Twitter is so toxic, I'm just going
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.220]   to stop talking in public.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.180]   That's kind of what I do.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.540]   And their voice is silenced.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.420]   Your voice is silenced.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.340]   Well, that's fine.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.940]   I mean, believe me, I'm the last person
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.300]   you'd say anything about silenced.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.700]   But if you didn't have a--
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.820]   That was huge at about 400 hours a week on the air, I guess.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.620]   I don't know.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.900]   Is Twitter a place people should go to have their voice heard?
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.700]   It's a broadcast.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.900]   I think it is more of a broadcast or narrow cast medium
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.740]   than it is a conversation.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.660]   Even if you tweet, though, the chances are--
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.580]   I mean, however many followers you have,
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.980]   that only a fraction of them are going to see that tweet.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:31.980]   Right?
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.100]   Yeah, I mean, it's a mixed bag.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.340]   Because you have to be there at the right time.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.700]   I mean, Tonya was telling me earlier
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.140]   that you suddenly decided you like Google+,
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.100]   which I find I'm totally incredulous about that.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.140]   Well, I know maybe it's just me, but my Google+
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.620]   has gotten great now that everybody laughs.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.740]   It's also no one is there.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.260]   Exactly.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.460]   It's so much better.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.180]   It used to be the place if you wanted--
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.540]   I didn't know it still existed.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.820]   But it's a harassment-free zone.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.860]   This is what I was saying back when everybody was--
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.820]   It always has me.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.420]   Partly because even though they no longer
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.700]   have a real name's policy, it's kind of built into it
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.700]   in such a way that it still kind of has that.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.700]   It's also if you're in tech, it's a great place.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.700]   If you're tech--
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.700]   That's how you're an Android fan.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700]   It's like unbelievable.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.700]   Well, in fact--
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.700]   It's all developers, you know,
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.700]   trying to keep people and journalists.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.700]   And scientists, too.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.940]   I use Reddit because I follow the Reddit tech stories.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.140]   So Reddit is a great tech feed for me.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.140]   I love Reddit.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.460]   I love seeing all that other stuff.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.060]   Thank God.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.580]   But if I go to Reddit, I'm going to learn about my grandmother's hand-made quilt.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580]   I'm going to-- I don't know.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.580]   The ones I follow tend to be--
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.580]   It's the tech section?
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   No.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580]   No.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.980]   That's political humor or something.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.660]   But actually, that's-- I think Reddit's surfacing that is something that I'm not necessarily
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   following.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.020]   But-- Oh, I'm not logged in.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   That's why.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.020]   There you go.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   This is my--
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.020]   Sorry, grandma.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   This is just the generic.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.260]   By the way, Reddit's very careful on this front page when you are not logged in not to
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.260]   show anything controversial.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.260]   Reddit is fantastic.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.260]   But it's not-- I think Reddit is better for--
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.020]   I wouldn't want my mom to go to Reddit.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.580]   It's too easy to see stuff you wish you hadn't, isn't it?
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.020]   It's not as bad as Twitter, though, because on Reddit, if you're on the best--
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.020]   You know, not the best thing.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.540]   You're the best place for me, for geeks.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.060]   Hacker News is great feedback.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   I love that.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.860]   I only see things I really am interested in.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.140]   It's basically the command line of news.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.540]   But that just shows you that social networks maybe are best when they're not universal
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   when they're--
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.740]   But you're segregating into topics you're interested in.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.540]   My little corner of the world.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.220]   But Twitter succeeds because it is.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.580]   Well, isn't it universal?
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   It's still only--
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.660]   It's a few hundred million people at best.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.580]   It's primarily media and journalists.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.740]   And it's an echo chamber, for sure.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.340]   But it's very culturally relevant for that reason.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.860]   It culturally relevant people.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:55.540]   And high prominent people, TV shows, everybody-- all those kinds of people use Twitter and
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.260]   have big accounts, also singers and actors and so on.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:03.940]   If you look at the top 100, it's like 80% Beyonce's and singers and so on.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.340]   But isn't it-- it's kind of like-- I don't know.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.380]   It's kind of like watching TV and hoping for a high-speed chase.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.780]   It's really most interesting when it goes off the rails.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.740]   When Lady Gaga gets upset about her neighbor and starts tweeting crazy stuff.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.940]   That's what you're hoping for.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.380]   It's like watching the Indy 500.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.380]   You're really--
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.140]   Or watching celebrities troll each other.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.940]   Like Hillary Clinton troll Trump after the--
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.860]   Surate to zero.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.220]   And then Kelly and Conway trolling Hillary Clinton for that.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.380]   I think it's worth recognizing that Trump has been president for three weeks.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.900]   And Twitter has completely changed in those three weeks.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:49.380]   Like this conversation is in some ways dated because there's this weird thing going on.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.100]   We're like, we're all talking about the same stuff at the same time.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.060]   And maybe I'm like diluting myself into believing that.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.820]   But I do actually believe that for the first time we're having a national conversation.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.460]   Because whatever Trump did today, it's the most interesting and impactful thing that
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.300]   we're all dealing with in our lives.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.460]   And usually when he said on Twitter, not what he said in the press conference.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.020]   Well, he gets up in the morning and he sets the agenda for the political conversation
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.020]   for the day.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.500]   And it's very powerful and nobody can do anything about it.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.620]   And we all talk about how there's no hits in anymore.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.340]   There's no TV show that everyone's going to watch.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.340]   We're all watching TV show.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.340]   Actually, my Facebook feed's kind of become that way as well.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.060]   It's become a news feed much more than it used to be.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.420]   Tell me you're going to get that hat, Leo.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.260]   I don't really even know why.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:37.460]   This is my problem with Twitter is it's so contextless that it's just, I feel like I'm
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.820]   reading just completely random bits of.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.740]   Is that like a potato or a hot sauce?
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.980]   It looks like an octopus on a top hat.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.180]   And it's from some guy I must follow, right?
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.180]   I don't know.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.700]   He's a social media nitwit and he's written a book called Pam Mastery and a crime novel
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.300]   called Butterfly Stomp Waltz and a science fiction novel.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.140]   Wow, this guy's prolific called hydrogen sleets and he likes punching Nazis.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.220]   That's probably why I'm following him.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.300]   I don't know why I'm following him.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.700]   I don't know how that happened.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.020]   That's the other thing that happens with Twitter, isn't it?
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.180]   You accumulate people.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.180]   Yes.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.180]   For reasons you don't remember.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.580]   I have Unfollow Friday, like every Friday I go.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   That's a good one.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.580]   I like that.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.580]   And I clear clear out.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.580]   Can you though?
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.260]   And this is the other thing that I think is problematic with Twitter.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.540]   You used to be able to cultivate your feed and tilt it in a direction like I'm just going
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   to follow journalists.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   Just follow the tick-tongue.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.540]   You can't even do that anymore.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.940]   Nobody sticks to this subject.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.700]   Can I share my philosophy of how to do social media?
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.860]   I basically don't think social media is a good place to get content at all.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.580]   What I like to do is I like to use the old-fashioned way.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.580]   You get some right-leaning publications.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.020]   I get reason because I'm interested in a libertarian point of view.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.060]   Yes, news and report is kind of right-leaning.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.180]   There's a bunch of left-leaning and you get some centrist publications.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.180]   It's just right-of-college.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.020]   And you get those content and then you go in post and then you engage with the people
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.180]   who reply to your post and that's your social media.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.180]   I don't think it's a good place to just open yourself up to this fire hose of Drek that
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.180]   just comes before and end.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.220]   I think the best thing every one of you listening could do and all of us do is just
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.620]   get off social media.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.220]   Period and you just feel this lifting of a burden.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.700]   I saw a story today that said that if you stop watching TV and stop using social media.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.700]   The world's not so bad.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.780]   You'll have enough time to read 1,000 books a year.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   Wow.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.060]   If you're an average American.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.140]   I've started to make that about cable news because I realized I was listening to a great
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.780]   interview on a podcast of all things.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.180]   It was Alec Baldwin's "Here's the Thing."
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   Oh, I like podcast.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.180]   I love Alec Baldwin.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.180]   He's an interrogator.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.180]   He makes it all about himself.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.180]   But he's interesting.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.140]   He goes to an ass.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.340]   And he interviewed a well-known journalist who said, "I no longer watch cable news because
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.340]   it's not news.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.340]   You're filling a 24-hour news cycle.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.060]   It's all punditry and opinion."
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.740]   Because that's entertainment.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.260]   Your stress level, my blood pressure, when I don't watch cable news and I don't visit
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.140]   social media, it's much, much better.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.340]   Leo, I'm reading a book right now called "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.340]   Yes.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   Fan.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.340]   Hertabot.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.340]   A fantastic book.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.340]   It's a few years old.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.140]   But basically, if you go to his Twitter feed, he literally has zero activities.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.900]   He's never tweeted anything.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:28.060]   But he talks about how the digital movement has done is this done two simultaneously crazy
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.060]   things.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.380]   It's made the value of what he calls "deep work," which is where you really sit down
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.980]   and think without distraction, far more valuable.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.940]   But there's also put all this pressure on people to do shallow work.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.340]   So people who used to do deep work like journalists, they're now being pressured by
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.140]   their organizations that go out and be tweeting all the time, which is shallow work.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.900]   And so there's this huge opportunity for people to think deeply and do deep work because
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.220]   nobody's doing it and the value of it is through the roof.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.620]   And the value of shallow work is just very, very low and getting lower all the time.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.220]   You guys do long-form stuff.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   Exactly.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.220]   Super valuable stuff.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.380]   And you can't do long-form journalism well if you're like checking Twitter.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.940]   It's five seconds.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.580]   And you're being distracted and you have the news going and all this kind of stuff.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.580]   You can't do it.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.580]   You have to have a quiet room.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.140]   You have to do some serious thinking.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.620]   You have to do some serious digging.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.220]   Otherwise, it doesn't work.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   And so I recommend that everybody--
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.220]   It was just something to an episode of Reply All Today where they were talking about the
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.980]   interview guy who has ALS and has to type with his eyes.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.340]   And he was talking about how he actually feels like he's been reborn as like a thinker
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:36.860]   because he used to be-- he used to do so many things that are not even possible to do
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.460]   at the speed he can do now that he can really engage in the world.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.140]   Maybe handwriting would be another for me.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.220]   I'd probably type right about as slowly as he can type because my handwriting is so
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.220]   terrible.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.500]   I think of Stephen Levy, who's one of my favorite journalists has been on this show.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.740]   He says he's a slow news writer.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.260]   Just like slow food.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.260]   Yep.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.260]   Yep.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.820]   That's the new cooking thing, new restaurant, slow food.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.940]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.860]   And I want to talk about ITProTV and then we'll continue.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.500]   Great panel here.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.420]   Jason Heiner from Tech Republic at CBS Interactive.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.780]   Always a pleasure to have you.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   Why are you out?
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   Are you out for RSA?
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   Yeah, I'm here for RSA.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.980]   A lot of people in the studio audience too, programmers, coders, couple of guys from Code
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.260]   Blocks podcast who are here for RSA, the big security conference in San Francisco.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.580]   This is always a fun time of year because, as Mike Elgin pointed out, it's also beer
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   week.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.580]   Beer week in San Francisco.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.100]   There's something like, I think there are 180 breweries represented in restaurants throughout
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.220]   the city.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.220]   So check out the beer week.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.020]   What is it about programmers in beer?
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.460]   They're just a natural kind of symbiotic journalist.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.900]   They're a bunch of trunks.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.900]   No offense.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   Well, nobody could be wine.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.420]   I guess it's programmers like whiskey and beer, right?
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   Yeah, they're nodding.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   Okay, I got it right.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.300]   Liz Gaines is also here from 60db.co.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.740]   We were talking about that earlier.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.740]   Love it.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   60db.co.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.740]   Thanks.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.820]   And I want to hear more about your journalism fellowship.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.180]   What a great, that sounds like a great thing.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.420]   Did you have to apply for that?
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.580]   Yeah, you do.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.580]   But it's worth it.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.460]   In this field where people are turning us away, laying people off, buying people out,
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.820]   to have someone invest in, allow you to live on a stipend for a year.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   Is it your grand--
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.820]   Who's the night foundation?
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.820]   Ah, yeah.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.500]   So of course, our great friend Jeff Jarvis, who co-hosts this week in Google, works at
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.580]   the townite school of journalism in the CUNY.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.580]   You see this?
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.420]   Yeah, but then there's also the Nike night guys.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.420]   So everything in the world now is in--
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   You're not film night.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   Yours is the other night.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.420]   John has night.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.420]   Yeah, that's a night writer.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   Well, you did have to ask that.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.100]   Actually, being at Stanford last year, yeah, it's confusing because he paid for the whole
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.100]   business school.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.500]   Oh, there is a film night business school.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   Dualing nights.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   Wow.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   That's funny.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.820]   We can have Brichena Cough make a new movie.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   I don't know.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.500]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.660]   The guys are in studio.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.660]   They're around somewhere.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.860]   Tim and Don, the founders of ITProTV.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.300]   Well, they're maybe they're out drinking beer.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   Maybe they're doing that.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.620]   They're also in town for the RSA conference.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.100]   They cover it on ITProTV.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.580]   So here's another way you can get your coverage of RSA.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.940]   They do a lot of interviews all week long at RSA.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.620]   What is ITProTV?
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.420]   It's actually a really cool idea.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.140]   I think Tim and Don saw what we do here at Twit.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   They were fans of Tech TV.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:26.620]   They said, "Would somebody oughta do something like that for online IT training, for keeping
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.140]   your IT skills up for learning?"
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.340]   And that's why they created ITProTV.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.540]   They have five studios in Gainesville, Florida.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.300]   They are doing Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 video.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.500]   They do it much like we do.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.220]   They have chat rooms going on.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.020]   But the subject matter is all the stuff you need to know either if you want to get the
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.540]   IT certifications or you want to keep up to date.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.260]   They offer 2,000 hours of content, 30 new hours every week.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.180]   You can watch it on your Chromecast, your Roku, your Amazon Fire TV.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.780]   They have a great Apple TV app.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.300]   Of course, you could stream it on your PC or tablet.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.480]   Courses include things like Certified Information Systems Security Professional, CompTIA's
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.420]   Project, plus if I'd all the CompTIA certs.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.860]   One of my favorites is Certified Ethical Hacker.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.900]   I want to be this when I grow up.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.420]   Ethical hacking, they got version 9 just went up.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.740]   Sean Ariado has been teaching that and they have others, some of the best people in security
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.980]   teaching this.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.820]   So you can, you know, what, I mean, you'd be guaranteed a job, right?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.340]   If you knew this stuff, you would be guaranteed.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:34.580]   Upcoming courses, AWS solutions, pen testing, networking plus.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.900]   We had one of our detectives in the pedal of the police department came to me and said,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.620]   "I'm now in charge of forensics.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.700]   I need to learn how to use Wireshark."
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.500]   I said, "I'll tell you exactly where you go to learn Wireshark, IT Pro TV."
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.820]   In fact, I can't tell you the commercial customers because they're customer.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.100]   They don't want to tell everybody.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.060]   But I could tell you that for some reason the universities don't mind.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.900]   The entire Harvard IT department subscribes to IT Pro TV.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   So does MIT.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.900]   So does UCSD.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   So does Stanford.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.900]   Liz.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.940]   Everybody knows this is the best way to keep those skills up today.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.460]   They have a low monthly subscription price and because they started giving, you know, teaching
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.100]   people to get the certs, they have an easy no hassle cancellation policy.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.860]   But you know what, I think even if you get the cert and you get the job, you're going
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:23.020]   to continue to become a member and continue to watch because it's fun.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.820]   Premium annual membership is $57 a month or you get two months free if you subscribe
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.420]   for a year.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.980]   But we got a special deal.

[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.420]   buy.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.980]   By the way, ITProTV is in process of introducing a new membership level.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.900]   They're going to do that soon.

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.540]   We're talking high tech, we're talking the world of technology.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.340]   I'm just going to a little parenthetically, I got the new Android Wear 2.0 watch.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.340]   Isn't that attractive?
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.340]   Isn't that lovely?
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.700]   Don't I look like a prisoner on Work4Lo?
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   Hach.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.700]   Just.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   Okay.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.420]   And by the way, not only is it ugly, it's uncomfortable as heck because this is the sport,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.420]   the LG sport.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.980]   It's like an inch off your wrist.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.180]   It's huge and it doesn't stop at the watch in the band.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.780]   They put the antennas so the band is rigid halfway down your wrist which means it really
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.340]   does feel like one of those Work4Lo bracelets.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.900]   I won't tell you how I know that.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.460]   But it's not comfortable.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.460]   You can't change the band, it's like rubber.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.300]   And I'm not impressed by Android Wear 2.0.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.580]   They've added some nice features but I can make phone calls from this by the way, it
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.300]   has a SIM card and a phone number.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.020]   My watch has its own phone number.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.940]   But would you want to?
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.420]   Well, you look kind of dorky going, Dick Tastes, Dick Tracy.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.860]   Why pay for one account on AT&T?
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   You can pay for two.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.860]   Exactly.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:22.180]   All the redundant internet we pay for is just like it's something that's crazy.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180]   It has.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.940]   It's electronic supposed to get smaller over time.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   Well, there's a lot in here.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   I mean it has a barometer.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.340]   It's so much bigger than the Samsung.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.340]   That's what I don't quite understand.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.820]   And that does all of that there.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.820]   It does.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.140]   The Gear S3 does, it has a SIM card in it.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.620]   It's literally half as thick as that.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.500]   Do you have to watch out to not twist the band too much?
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.580]   Well, I don't know.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.340]   I mean, you could feel the antennas are going right down here.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.780]   I don't know how fragile that is, but I can't wait to stop wearing it.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   That's good.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.260]   Never a good sign.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.980]   I think you just did stop wearing it.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.300]   Well, it does feel good when you take it off.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.740]   There's something to say about.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.140]   It's funny when the whole smart watch thing started.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   What a flaw.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.420]   I felt like I quit wearing watches like 10 years ago.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   Or maybe not quite that long.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.380]   How do you train this not to wear a watch?
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.820]   The smartphone made it unnecessary.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   And I started wearing the Apple watch.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.100]   I'm still wearing it.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.300]   One of the probably of the 10 people I knew that got it was the only one still wearing
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   it.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.220]   But the only reason, and I hated wearing a watch.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.500]   And so the only reason I kept wearing it was because it was comfortable.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.420]   The band is actually the cheap band is actually really comfortable.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.620]   And then there's only, but they pitched this all wrong with smart watches.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.780]   I feel like they pitch it as like you're going to have this computer on your wrist.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.420]   And that was their whole thing.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.420]   What would you say?
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.580]   I think it's a slightly smarter fit bit.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.100]   It's just it's in a fit bit is just a slightly smarter pedometer.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.100]   Right.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.100]   So you're really not.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.700]   You're not making a lot of progress here.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.900]   You know, you're still, if you were, this is the ascent of man, you're still on your knuckle
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   walking.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.580]   The visuals for the exercise stuff are slightly better.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.580]   The circles, right?
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.580]   That's slightly better.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.980]   I want to get circles works for me because I see other people's circles and it motivates
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.500]   me to get off my stuff.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.460]   So the social network aspect of it actually is the only thing I think that's strong about
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.940]   the Apple watch.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.860]   Other than that, the only thing I use it for is the alerts.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.020]   It is nice not have to pull your phone out of your pocket for me because it makes me
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.580]   easier to ignore things.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.300]   And then having the weather on it.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:36.260]   I have the one thing that that's really that's all I use it for.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.180]   But I had a fit bit before.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.540]   And so it's a slightly smarter fit bit.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.780]   The promise of these was you would take your phone out less often because you could look
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   at your watch.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.500]   But what I find is the watch is just like so brief that I'll go, oh, that notification,
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.260]   I better read that and I take my phone out.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.660]   So I'm now doubly annoying.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.300]   Well, somebody asked me the time and I take my phone out and then I'm like, oh yeah,
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   I think this is forget this guy.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.460]   I will, I will say I ignore a lot more things by not.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.540]   The interesting thing is that I think even Apple, although Tim Cook on the analyst call
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.820]   last week did say that the watch had its biggest revenue quarter ever.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:20.540]   I could see a lot of people hopping on the late adopter train this past six months.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.260]   But since they don't give us numbers, it's not really a meaningful thing.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.100]   It was our biggest quarter ever.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.460]   I mean, it what they sold twice as many, you know, who reminds me of one Amazon was bragging
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.380]   about the Echo in the first year or so.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.380]   What is that mean?
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.900]   More than last year when we didn't sell it.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   Right.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.460]   I think the interesting thing with Apple Watch is it is meaningful.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:50.820]   Some of the third party people that track it have said that it is now next to you.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.620]   They are the number one vendor.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.900]   Watch selling number two, watch smelling after the world.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.060]   Well, if you don't count, it is a watch.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.580]   Oh, if you count watches.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.340]   It's number one, swatch, Timex.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.900]   It's one of the Swiss watchmakers.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:13.540]   I just think that of all the smart watches, absolutely the Apple Watch is better than
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.540]   Android where this did not save Android where Motorola already knew that they dropped the
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.580]   360 line entirely.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.420]   And I'm not even convinced the Apple Watch is worth even a really stupid theory about
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   why they're selling so well all of a sudden.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   And the theory is this.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:32.220]   I think Apple fans see new stuff as a kind of crack cocaine every year or two.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.740]   They need a new hit.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   And they're not buying the Mac.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.140]   They're not buying the Mac because the Mac book shows the laptop.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.100]   They've been waiting four years for a laptop.
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.940]   Actually selling a lot of those.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.940]   But a lot relative in Mac.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.420]   It's been interesting theory probably completely wrong but it's funny.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.860]   That was probably through pent up demand.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.860]   It's their crack.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.860]   It's a crack.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.860]   It's a crack cocaine theory.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   It's a pretty good theory.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.700]   It is a pretty good theory because there's not a whole lot to get excited about.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.700]   The Mac is sold.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.100]   The Mac is sold really well.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.300]   I'm using it.
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.780]   But it's mostly because of pent up demand I think.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   Yes.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.340]   Because I do know a lot of people that were waiting and they weren't thrilled with it.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.780]   I think the touch bar.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.340]   I don't use much of it and it's more annoying than it is helpful.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.340]   Exactly.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.780]   I can't believe that by accident.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:19.740]   But I think if it integrates with more software maybe there's some things on it that could
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.740]   be useful.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   No.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   It's never going to be useful.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.740]   Never.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.740]   But I just right now it's more annoying than useful to me.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.420]   This is a lot of power in a very...
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.420]   You got the 13.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420]   Of the 13.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.180]   So it's very similar to an air, very similar weight.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.780]   It's a lot of power in a small laptop.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.100]   It's a great laptop but so was the one that they came out with four years ago.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.860]   I think you'd be just as happy with the 2013.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.500]   Yeah I think so too.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.700]   A higher powered version of it.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.180]   I love the little things.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.940]   I love the MagSafe thing a lot.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.940]   That was a big loss.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:53.940]   And it's going to kill that also.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.940]   That was a big loss.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.420]   Although I think Type C is the future.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.940]   I'll stick with that.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.500]   I want everything to be Type C.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.060]   My phones, my laptops, everything should be Type C.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.980]   Trey Rachcliffe our good friend and stellar photographer wrote a blog post this week.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.900]   Apple is dead to me.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:14.420]   Now you got to remember Trey is a Mac fanatic for his whole photo career.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.140]   I'm switching to Windows.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:22.460]   And I worry that this may be a trend among the high end users.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.460]   And that's what he says.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.060]   He expands on his surface.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.100]   On my Windows 10 surface which I...
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.020]   I'm seeing this again and again with video editors.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.500]   My son does video editing.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.020]   He does special effects.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.580]   And he does graphics, computer animation.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.860]   He's using Windows.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.860]   Had to.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.420]   There's just not the Max on.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.460]   The Mac Pro is three years old down.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.060]   So this is what Trey got.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.300]   I'm not sure I would have recommended this but this is what he bought as an MSI.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:49:01.100]   Basically with desktop replacement laptop for $4,99.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.100]   But the Apple is top out at what?
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.100]   16 gigs of RAM.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.020]   This is 32.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.820]   If you're a photographer that's a big deal.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.820]   It is a big deal.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:14.060]   Raid hard drives with a terabyte spinning drive and a 256 gig SSD.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:19.620]   It's got the Nvidia Quadro which is a video card artist and graphic designers use.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.900]   It's probably not great for gaming but it's got a lot of horsepower for graphics.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.420]   The funny thing is because I still use Windows a lot too.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.620]   The funny thing is when you go back and forth like for Mac and I see this a lot of people
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:34.780]   that have switched to is you remember how buggy Windows is.
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.780]   Even at...
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   It's like...
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   It still...
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.540]   It drives me crazy because you throw all this power at it.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.980]   Like a machine like this should just scream.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   Nothing should slow it down.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.580]   Until his first ransomware notice.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   And then it's all...
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.420]   And then it's like you still...
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.700]   It does weird Windows things where things hang, things crash.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.140]   Yeah, he's in the honeymoon period.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   And it's just like...
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:59.460]   And I know I see a lot of Mac people do this where he's saying, "Oh, this isn't so bad."
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.460]   Right?
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.460]   Because you wait.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.060]   Yeah, your expectation is going to be terrible.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.780]   Now you were the editor of Windows Mac.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.780]   Yes.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.780]   You've been the long time developer.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.100]   And I still have habits from Windows that bug me when I'm using a Mac.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.580]   For example, when I do this sort of what is it?
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.420]   The command tab thing to call through.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.420]   The command tab.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:23.020]   And if the window is minimized, it doesn't maximize again.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.020]   I ask for literally...
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.020]   It drives me nuts.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.020]   It's like, "Oh, really?
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.580]   I have to go down to the..."
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.220]   Little stuff like that really bugs me.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.340]   But I think the thing to do, if you're going to use Windows, reformat it every month.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.340]   And you're going to have to find it.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.340]   It works great.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.340]   It is cool that they built that into it.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.340]   That it's easier to do that.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.340]   It's easy to do that.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.260]   And you kind of love the Surface Studio.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   I mean, this is really...
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.180]   This is an all-in-one, but it's a very nichey product.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.660]   I mean, we have a bunch of programmers in the studio.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.580]   You're not going to sit here with a screen tilted at this angle programming.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.580]   And if...
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:56.860]   I love it for what I'm doing, but if you put it in its normal, this is no different than
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.500]   an iMac or any other all-in-one or a big screen.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.140]   That's like saying, "Weel of Fortune is a really good format for putting letters up
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.140]   on a board."
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.140]   Yeah, it is for that particular purpose.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:13.180]   Actually, Tim Cook is traveling around Europe, gave an interview this week to the Independent
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.500]   in London in which he said...
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:22.140]   And this is interesting that he thinks augmented reality is going to be as big a product category
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.660]   as the iPhone.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.780]   And I thought that that was telling because it's obvious, if you've been watching Apple's
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.020]   results, that they're looking for their next iPhone.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:35.620]   The iPhone turned Apple from being a little computer company into being the most valuable
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.620]   company in the world.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.260]   It doesn't that comment sound kind of a little desperate because they don't have a product
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.260]   there?
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.620]   Well, he's doing what Apple does so well.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:49.940]   Well, I thought you'd call it a hobby if you're not going to do it yet.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:58.860]   But I think what Apple does is they use these interviews to kind of get people in the mindset.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.860]   I think they...
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.860]   They're creating demand, right?
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.340]   We talked about this last week with Robert Scobble, who was a little cracked on this
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:09.380]   subject, but he's convinced that augmented reality is in Apple's future.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:15.900]   And I think that it's interesting because I do feel like he feels that when he says something
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.780]   like that, that's not offhand.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.900]   You know, Tim and Apple in general are very calculated about what they say.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:23.900]   I did it.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.900]   So I did a piece.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:31.060]   This is related that on this week or Monday on Facebook.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.020]   Because I think Facebook is about...
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.420]   So Facebook is investing in this really heavily too.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.700]   Well, Oculus Rift, they bought.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:45.260]   And notice when they made the hire of Hugo...
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.260]   Hugo Barra.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   Hugo Barra from...
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.900]   He was at Google and then he went to Xiaomi.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.140]   But he was a great demonstrator for Android.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.980]   He was a beloved figure on stage at Google.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.180]   Xiaomi, I think he might have been a little frustrated he had to move to China.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.180]   He's back with Facebook.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.180]   I think he used to India too, right?
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   Yeah, he's been a lot of it.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.180]   He spent a lot of it.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.180]   He spent a lot of it.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.180]   Xiaomi was moving into India.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.180]   Yeah, that's where they were.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.140]   Other sales were.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:13.660]   But you notice that when Mark Zuckerberg said, introduced him, he said, "He's going to be
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.420]   running all of our virtual reality stuff, including Oculus."
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   Including.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   Including.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   Exactly.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:26.660]   And so we've been hearing for a while that they're working really hard on augmented reality.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.180]   See, the problem with augmented reality though is you can't...
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.060]   Zuckerberg can't sneak up on you because you can see the world.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:38.100]   I love that picture of Zuckerberg sneaking up all the people wearing their hockey.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.100]   Literally.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.380]   I mean, the way Facebook thinks of the world is they're like, "Oh my God, there are times
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.980]   when people are not looking at their screen."
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.660]   So the little red thing that tells you you have new items.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.500]   How do we get them to see that?
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   Ah.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.700]   We'll find out in April that's when F8, their developers conference is going up.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.020]   And if they are going to make a move into AR, this is where they're going to make the
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   announcement.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.020]   I'm sure.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:02.940]   Think about their database of people, of companies, of places, of all those things.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.540]   And then you think about that feeding and augmented reality product.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.540]   Hell yeah.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:11.700]   I want to be walking around and I see Jason Heiner and I see your feed pop up.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.380]   I know the name of your wife, your kids.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.380]   I know what I'm thinking about you.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.380]   Do that article I posted about it?
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.180]   I said, "I love your new art thing you wrote about."
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.580]   Because I'm reading it while I'm talking to you.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.660]   Now, the interesting thing I realized is that for augmented reality, we always think
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.780]   of the hollow lens and glasses and VR kind of stuff.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:32.140]   But Apple's AirPods are definitely, as we've talked about before, wearables, more than
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.380]   just headphones.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:38.020]   And augmented reality merely means you're taking the world and you're augmenting it.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.220]   Could it be audio?
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.940]   Could it be telling me in my ear?
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.500]   Oh, that's Jason Heiner.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   You've known him for years.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.540]   It will be audio and possibly also optionally video.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.500]   But there are two little tiny, tiny, tiny startups that have it right and their ideas
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.420]   are going to be stolen from them by the big companies.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.980]   But one of them is called View.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.980]   They're called View Glasses.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.900]   I interviewed the founders there in San Francisco.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.300]   And they just get acquired?
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.500]   I don't think so.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.140]   But if they did, it'll be news to me.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   They were a Kickstarter.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.140]   They're Kickstarter.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.020]   There's no video element other than blinking light.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.180]   So it's a red blink that means mom is trying to reach me and if it's a green light, that
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:12.140]   means the boss or whatever.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.700]   And then they have an app, of course.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.260]   And then it's bone conduction on each side.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.260]   The battery lasts three days or some of the smart glasses.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.260]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.700]   And the audio, let me cut that.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.100]   And this is what the trending yellow--
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.100]   This is my go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.100]   That's right.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.100]   That's right.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.060]   And that's somebody wearing a visor.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   But this is the premise here is that you get some--
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.300]   There's less awkward.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.300]   And this is--
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.300]   I want it to look like a real glass.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   --regular glasses.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.620]   And there can be prescription, there can be sunglasses, there can be any glasses.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.620]   And--
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.720]   But it's audio only.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:46.100]   It's audio only plus a blinking light, but that audio is a killer feature.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.940]   Because we're entering into the realm of genuine AI virtual assistants.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.980]   And we're going to be chattering with them.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.300]   One way is the Amazon Echo way.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.420]   We have a device in every bathroom and everything.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.780]   The other one is it's always on you.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:59.220]   And you just talk and you hear back.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.060]   But it doesn't cover your ears and it doesn't have a battery life that dies in four hours.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.060]   There's another company from a high school--
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.460]   This looks like a great product.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:11.220]   There's a high school student in the Midwest who came out with another product that he's
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.220]   kickstarting.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.700]   And I think he's going to have a successful kickstarter.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:20.620]   And trying to remember what the name of the product is, the chat room, if you can remember.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.460]   But basically, it's a thing that clips on to any glasses and gives you bone conduction
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.020]   access to hound, to sound hound.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.820]   And which is a great virtual assistant that's underrepresented.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   Right.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.020]   It's like the alternative to the big companies.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.020]   Right.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.100]   And anyone can incorporate into their products, right?
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.100]   Exactly.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.140]   And this kid, he's a senior in high school.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.820]   Unfortunately, I did a search and I found a student brings AR-15 rifle to high school.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.420]   So that's different kind of AR.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.420]   Good.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:51.780]   We're talking K-A-I and smart glasses.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:55.100]   And anyway, I talked to this kid and he's a really sharp kid.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.740]   He's about to go off to university.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.540]   But the idea that he's got there, I think, is a high school kid.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.540]   He raised high school.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.380]   He didn't make it, by the way.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.380]   He's having a new fashion.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.380]   Oh, no, he still has March.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.380]   He still has till March.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.420]   So he's got 20,000 of 55,000.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.060]   But he still has 30 days to go on this.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.860]   So it's a dongle that you clip onto your glasses.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.540]   His patent, the only thing that's patented, it gives you a sound hound through bone conduction.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.540]   So as a microphone speaker.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.740]   I love that this is a high school kid.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.900]   And then on your phone, you can look and see what the sound hound has found.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.900]   No, it'll tell you.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:26.900]   Audible.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.460]   So it's like Amazon, Apple or Siri.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:33.820]   This does not work very well right now in the AirPods because the AirPods you double
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.300]   tap and Siri lies terrible in the face.
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.380]   In fact, I'm really unhappy with the AirPods.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.740]   I loved them at first.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.820]   But after dropping almost every call I've made with the AirPods, I've just given up
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   on them.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.820]   They're just not that good.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.820]   They're fine for listening to music.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.380]   So here's my theory about smart glasses in companies like Apple and Facebook.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:58:01.300]   So the best place to put something like Siri or Alexa is on glasses through bone conduction.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.300]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   Okay.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.300]   So that's the baseline.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.860]   That already is a killer app right there.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.300]   I would buy that right now.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.260]   Then if you can throw something onto the screen that's maybe a subtle cue of something like
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.900]   that, you know, Scoble said that Apple's working with Carl Zeiss.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.020]   I don't know if that's true or not, but Carl Zeiss has great technology we talked about
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.020]   on the show.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.220]   But just even if there's no visuals at all, even if there's no camera at all.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.060]   No, do the AirPods capability, but build it in the glasses.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.060]   Exactly.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.580]   Ears open, battery life lasts three days.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.260]   You can do it in a prescription glasses or sunglasses or any glasses.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.180]   And that's killer.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.380]   So that's what I think.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.660]   And I think that these little startup, what always happens is little startups do killer
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.020]   ideas and then the big companies come and steal them.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:50.660]   Well, I often wonder if a big company is really positioned to take advantage of these disruptive
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.660]   new technologies.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.260]   Doesn't it always come from the little guy?
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.580]   Actually, it always comes.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.180]   So there's a couple of misnomers about that.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.340]   It always comes from small teams.
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:02.220]   Pretty much every good innovation has always come from a small team.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:04.260]   And a lot of times it's a small startup, right?
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.100]   But it's also a lot of times it's small teams.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.100]   Well, that's when Google does that.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.300]   I don't think they're really trying to create this environment.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.300]   So it apples it.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.300]   It feels like a startup.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.300]   The Apple does that.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.300]   The iPhone was worked on.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.540]   I talked to last year a lot with the guy who was on the team that created the iPhone.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.380]   He said it was like 25 of us.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:26.660]   Here's the other thing that's shocking about this whole bone conduction idea for glasses.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.620]   There is no new technology there.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:29.620]   None.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.620]   Bone conduction has been around forever.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.620]   It's a microphone.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   Right.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.620]   This is like this.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.540]   You have to kind of strip away what you think of as augmented reality to say you're not
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.900]   looking at the world and seeing something projected on it.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.420]   All the technologies in the cloud.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:41.780]   And that's kind of my point.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:46.940]   And I think people when Tim Cook says augmented reality think HoloLens something like HoloLens.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   Right.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.940]   But they've got the earpods already.
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.300]   I see them doing something like this.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   This is interesting thought.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   It was a thought.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:58.220]   I might think it like the what might first come to mind for me is like an Alexa in your
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.580]   ear or on your glasses.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.580]   Well, I wouldn't say Siri because I don't find Siri very helpful.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.580]   Series useless.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.340]   Here's somebody who's taken on the HoloLens and turned put portal on it.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.500]   Wouldn't it be fun to play portal in your living room?
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.860]   Blow holes in your floor.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.860]   Drop companion cubes.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.860]   Hahaha.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.180]   Thru holes in your floor and out your ceiling.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.900]   I love this.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:30.540]   I don't know if this is real or but this is an article in the next the next web portal
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.300]   for Microsoft HoloLens makes life real life look great again.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.340]   I don't know what the I don't look at that.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340]   That's hard to do.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.300]   That's the companion cub is rolling down real stairs.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.980]   That's not easy.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.980]   So this is Kenny W.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:53.220]   He was an AR game maker and I guess he showed this on on Reddit but I don't know if well
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.940]   no he was actually doing this on a HoloLens.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.940]   Wow.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.940]   Because it's in Unity 3D portal is in Unity 3D.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.780]   I remember Microsoft saying all Unity apps can easily be ported to the HoloLens.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780]   Hm.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.780]   Interesting.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.980]   I can't get that excited about throwing things down.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.980]   Oh come on.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   It's like.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:12.980]   Come on.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   Alright.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.500]   I was going to make a crack about men.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   Are you like the throw things and that's that's fine.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.460]   Well what would be the perfect game for you Liz games.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.100]   I mean what would you like to do in virtual reality?
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   I'm going back to you.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.100]   It's a good play games.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.980]   I play a lot of dots on my iPhone.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.940]   See dots would be great.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.020]   Yeah my wife plays dots like crazy right.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.100]   Isn't that what you're playing?
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.780]   No she's laughing at me.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.940]   I'm not playing dots.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.420]   I'm playing bots.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.420]   It's like dots.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.020]   I actually like dots while I'm listening to something that I want to be intellectually
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.900]   engaged in because it's like mind focused.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.900]   That's what she does.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.300]   Because she's ADD.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.820]   So she does this and that's occupying that little corner of her brain that would be
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.820]   wandering.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.180]   Which is like kind of the opposite of gaming right.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.980]   But like for me it scratches in it.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.460]   I kind of do that with words with friends.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.700]   I like taking a lot of my social media time and I like putting into words with friends
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.700]   lately.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.700]   That's not a bad thing to do.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.700]   I see you pop up all the time.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.580]   I'm afraid you beat the pants off me.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   So I don't play with you.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:18.900]   All right we're going to talk more about tech with our great panel is gains from 60 dB
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.700]   dot co from becoming nomad.com the great Mike Elgin.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.300]   We saw it on the news screen.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.260]   Saviors on Saturday we played a little bit of that.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.580]   Keep talking and nobody blows up.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   That was fun.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580]   That was really fun.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.500]   I think it might be more fun for us playing it than it is for the people at home watching
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.500]   it.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500]   But I don't care.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.100]   I don't care because it's a VR game that's just a blast.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.340]   I'm Jason Heiner from CBS Interactive where I showed you they brought you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.340]   It's a product from Quick and Loans, the best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.420]   You don't have to take my word for it.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.460]   Look at the website, all the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Awards year after year.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.060]   But there was something missing.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.060]   They were happy.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.820]   They were doing a great job.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:03.660]   But they realized that they could make it even better by making it entirely online.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.540]   They knew there was a crowd out there.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.820]   People who listen to this show are a good example, who don't want to go to a mortgage
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:16.420]   lender, who don't want to go through boxes of papers to find check stubs and bank statements,
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.020]   who want to do it all on their phone.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.940]   They created Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.740]   It is an entirely online approval process.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.700]   Because it's computers, because it's online, it's fast.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:32.500]   You can think they have a video on the website of a couple at an open house looking at and
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   saying, "Honey, we should buy this."
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.420]   They show it to their realtor.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.900]   Well, we're approved.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.460]   You can actually submit pay stubs, submit back statements all online.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.260]   You don't have to bring them papers.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.460]   You can do the whole thing.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.500]   Because of computers, it happens in minutes.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.300]   They have settings that you can change the rate.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.780]   You can play with the rate and the time frame and all that stuff.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.980]   It really is personalized for you.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:05.620]   Get a personalized loan from a great mortgage lender that fits your exact financial situation
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.460]   and it's completely transparent and completely online.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.220]   It's Rocket Mortgage.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.220]   Skip the bank.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.220]   Skip the waiting.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.220]   Go completely online.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.940]   Quickandloans.com/twit and the number two.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.820]   Quickandloans.com/twit2=housinglender.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:32.740]   Gonna be the one that has a little bit of a chance to get a little money.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.460]   You're just Rocket Mortgage.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460]   It's Rocket Mortgage.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   It's Quickandloans.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.460]   A couple times without them and a couple times with them.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.660]   They're by far the most tech savvy.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.380]   How many houses do you buy?
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:51.660]   From moving, one of those was a finance.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.460]   You think he writes about tech?
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.380]   I wish I was actually savvy.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.380]   That's what played real horses.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.140]   I heard that on the last show.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.340]   He's become like this big house flipper.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.340]   Interesting.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:10.980]   His point is good that lots of the financial markets go up and down.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.740]   But real estate has stayed the same.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.820]   It's been like that from the beginning in this country.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.500]   People used to say that they invested it in real estate instead of cash because our
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.460]   cash wasn't very good at first because it was worth more than money.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.980]   Did you see the movie The Founder?
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   No.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980]   About Ray Crock, founder of McDonald's.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   So good.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.980]   So good.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.420]   But there's a revelatory moment where he's sort of working for the McDonald's brothers and
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.140]   he has no power at all.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.820]   He was a milkshake mixer salesman.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:43.700]   So he got it, he talked them into allowing him to run.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.260]   Everyone should have one.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.620]   He had this franchising business.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.620]   He had no power.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   He's making no money.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.620]   He was totally failing.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.820]   And then some sharp kid came in and he hired him.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.820]   And he's like, you know, you're in the wrong business.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:57.700]   What you got to do is buy the land and then lease it to the franchisees.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.220]   And the next thing you know, the McDonald's brothers, what they owned was one hamburger
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.140]   shop and he owned 400 of them.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.140]   And he started telling them what to do.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.140]   You know, it's a great.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.060]   It was my first job in high school.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:16.660]   McDonald's, I worked at McDonald's for years and it was actually a great first job.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.660]   They taught me that it's okay to work.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.700]   You can't like they said, you don't, what are you doing?
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.300]   Sitting around, you wiped down something.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.260]   Don't don't just sit around.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.260]   You're always doing something.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.020]   It was actually a and it was fun.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.660]   We wrote about that and follow the geeks.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:30.660]   You did.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.660]   Yes.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.820]   I've should the McDonald's stories in there.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.820]   Plug plug.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   I know I'm a bad.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.820]   I'm getting old.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.820]   I repeat my story.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.420]   In fact, stop listening to me.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   Just read, follow the geeks.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.540]   You'll know everything I want to say for the next three years.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.540]   Thank you for writing that.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.540]   That was fun.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.540]   Is that book still?
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.540]   It was fun.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540]   Still doing it.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540]   Yeah, it's doing great.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.020]   It's some audible Kindle and paper.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.180]   Did you do the audible?
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.180]   I did do the audible.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.820]   I only listen to books where the author reads them.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.220]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.780]   It's a mixed blessing.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.780]   It can be.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   It should not read.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.860]   But you, you've got a lot of audio experience.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.500]   It's really great to hear it in the voice.
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.500]   No, if it's a performer.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.140]   I listen to all these, like, there's this whole school of books of like female comedians
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.140]   who write memoirs.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.140]   They're like me too.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.140]   Young to write memoirs.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.900]   I just listen to Anna Kendrick's.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.540]   And she's done like a lot in her life, a lot more than me.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.020]   But like she's early in her career and she was a fantastic narrator.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.140]   Like her voice acting is just like so.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.140]   Oh, really?
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.140]   I just loved it.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.140]   I just heard it out on Broadway or something, didn't she?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.140]   Yeah, she did.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.140]   She said kids.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.140]   She was.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.740]   And she talks about that in her memoir because that's her life.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.500]   But she, I was really surprised versus like, I don't know, some other ones like Amy Pollers,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   I found like, eh, but Anna Kendrick, I was really into.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.340]   Daniel Suarez has a new book coming out.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.580]   You know, he did Freedom TM and oh, we just love his stuff.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.260]   And he has, he does not read his own books, honorable, but he's got a guy who reads all
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.260]   of his books.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.500]   Who's fantastic.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.900]   And Daniel all, no disrespect with one of my favorite writers.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.420]   And I can't, we're going to interview him on triangulation with his new book, but I'm
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.140]   glad he doesn't read.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:05.380]   Because, well, he has this great, he brought his narrator in the last time we interviewed
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   him.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.460]   He brought the guy who reads his books on audible.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.660]   And there was something magical.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.460]   He sat down and go back and look at that one.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.460]   That's kind of cool.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.900]   I feel like it's like a person locked in a soundproof closet.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.900]   Well, it is.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.940]   Like they actually get to come up to the level of the author.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.940]   Comes out of the view.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.740]   But he was sitting there and he said, and I said, okay, we'll read some and you're transported
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740]   immediately.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.620]   Oh, you hear the voice, you hear the sound.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.620]   You're in the middle of the novel.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.120]   And the guy is such a good actor.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.980]   Good a good reader, really is.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.300]   And this is not an audible ad.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.620]   Somehow we did an audible ad without doing that, being paid.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.500]   But a good reader really can make a difference.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.980]   Yeah, that's, but the audible one has been, I think because there's so many people that
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:49.300]   were involved in podcasting in my book, in File the Geeks, it's by far audible version
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.540]   has been the most popular.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.540]   I believe.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.140]   Do you voice the whole thing or did you get people to come on and do it?
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.740]   No, I read the whole thing.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.540]   Actually, you've forced all your subjects to do them.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.720]   I mean, I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.960]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.800]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.240]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.680]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   I think you've got to be a little bit more interested in the show.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.160]   Ronald McDonald, it was a big moment.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.360]   Not the other one across the street.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   There is a hamburger.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.360]   There's a hamburger.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   There is a hamburger.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.840]   You, you know, the hamburger university.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.040]   When I was, you know, I'm working at McDonald's in the high school.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.280]   I didn't tell you this part.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.440]   And I had to really make the decision.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.840]   Yale University or hamburger you.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.960]   And I wasn't sure which way to go.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   And I finally went with Yale.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.440]   And that's when I stopped working at McDonald's.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.520]   I said, you can't come back.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.960]   You don't want to work here.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.560]   You don't want to be a manager.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.400]   Said no, I have higher aspirations.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   A little bit.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   I know I didn't have a podcaster.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.560]   Uh, hashtag, did you watch the Super Bowl last Sunday?
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.680]   We ran home after the show and I got the second half and we have a number of people
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.880]   in the studio from Atlanta.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.120]   But what a game, right?
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   Atlanta played great.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.800]   Atlanta played great right up till they didn't.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.200]   And then they were really only, I mean, like three different points.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.720]   They were one play away.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.120]   I know closing the game, closing it out.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   You know the sad.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   It was unbelievable.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.800]   I know our audience couldn't care less about football, but we're going to talk about for
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.040]   it just a second.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.600]   The sad story of course is that their offensive, Atlanta is a defensive coordinator.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.720]   Kyle Shanahan really was the one who blew that game by instead of running down the clock
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.120]   and doing a lot of running plays, decided for some reason no one understands to go to
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.720]   the air and basically lost the game for him.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.800]   He's our new coach in San Francisco at the 49.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.720]   So we're really glad to have you Kyle.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.360]   Looking forward to great things.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:49.080]   It's been really nice that the 49ers have been so bad because I resolved that I'm like
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.960]   morally against football because of the concussion problem.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   Oh, you should be.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   You're right.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   You know, morally or against all the players.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.560]   But like, you know, I decided I was going to stop watching football and then there was
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   like, they got terrible.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.480]   You're like, no, like the stadium is empty during the game.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   Really?
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.200]   It's like the most expensive game in football.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   It's in Silicon Valley.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.760]   If you go to a Niners game, it's almost always filled with the opposing team's fans.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   It's got to happen.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   Who bought them for cheap.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   Yeah, it's not like tickets.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   I'm not going to see.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.680]   They have the away team advantage.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   It's a yes.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.640]   It's a it's they can get there.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   It's amazing.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.600]   Well, the last game of the season, Seahawks game, you might have might as well have been
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   in Seattle.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.920]   I mean, there were no 49ers fans there.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.840]   Why would they be fair weather fans?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.000]   Anyway, food of the stadium is good though.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.280]   If you can get to get don't get me started.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:45.680]   So hashtags in the Super Bowl in the ads slipped 30%.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   Is that bad?
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.280]   Is that more bad news for Twitter?
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.040]   Stags slipped 30%.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   That was the big thing.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   You couldn't have an ad for a while.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   You couldn't have an ad in Super Bowl without a hashtag.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   I think it's part of the harassment problem.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   I think people hijack hashtags.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   You don't want to be part of that.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   Especially high visibility.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   You better get home your domain that you're telling everyone to do.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.040]   So that's what they do.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   You are LUs.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.040]   It's funny enough.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040]   Now that you say that we wrote an article like before Super Bowl like how your brand can use the Super Bowl hashtag.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   You should brand it to insert yourself in the conversation.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   Exactly.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.040]   In the '66 Super Bowl, only five use their Twitter handles.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.040]   Only four use their Facebook handles.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   Wow.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.040]   I think that's a big shift.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   That's a big shift.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.040]   That's a big shift.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.040]   That's a big shift.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   Somebody from marketing land has to sit down and watch the whole game and count hashtags.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.040]   That's what they're writing.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040]   I never heard it.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   They're watching it anyway.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040]   They got a graph.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   Someone volunteered for that.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.040]   I'd like to watch and count hashtags.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   Thank God for Tivo.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]   At least you can.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.040]   Avo secrets.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   You're right.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.040]   I think you probably.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   I did listen to the end of the game all the bit.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   I went against my band and listened to the end on TuneIn which brought me an Atlanta area station which had not sold any streaming ads.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.040]   So we had like Pink Panther music every time that you went to commercial.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   It was like the opposite of the time.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   That is something we need to solve.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   That is something like I listened to CNN on TuneIn.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   The worst repetitive bad ads and I'm sure that's all they could sell.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   We've got to solve that.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   Watching TV on Hulu is a solution.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.040]   It's the same damn Captain Obvious ad over and over.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   Here's the solution.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   60 DB should make commercials or shows that are just that length and then they can insert them in commercial spaces.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.040]   You know what?
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040]   You got to think creatively.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:46.040]   I listened to a story on 60 DB on Marketplace this past week about how.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   Creative marketers are buying ads on Morning Joe which is like a relatively cheap buy because that's how you reach the president.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   You know that he watches cable news.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   So what are they advertising?
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040]   Whatever they want to.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   Whatever you need the attention.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   No, no, no, not like to buy his stuff.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.040]   Like to influence his policy.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]   Interesting.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   That's fascinating.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.040]   And then he goes on and says everybody is saying and then whatever he saw on the ad.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   There was an ad I'm told for Gorsuch.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   The Supreme Court Justice nominee.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040]   They're running ads.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.040]   The administration is.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.040]   Yes.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.040]   Or somebody is probably a pack.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   I mean the slots that they pulled for the Obama care ads.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]   That's right.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.040]   The House has done something good.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   They passed the Email Privacy Act.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   We've got to praise them for that.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   This is a weird artifact for a long time of the electronic communications privacy act was that any email on a server longer than 180 days was considered abandoned by the user and law enforcement didn't need a warrant to see it.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   It's like well you left it there for six months.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040]   You obviously didn't want it anymore.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.040]   But times change.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.040]   People do leave their email on the Gmail server for years.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.040]   I've got every email I've ever received a Gmail for almost 11 years right?
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040]   That's what you do with it.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   House passes Senate yet to vote.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.040]   But they're going to be done with the confirmation hearings in what like a year.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.040]   So you see if this actually goes into law.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.040]   I don't think the Senate's going to pass it.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   I don't think they will.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   So the bill updates it to say that no you should have to get a warrant to access emails, social media posts and any online content that is more than 180 days old.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   There shouldn't be a sunset.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   But you're saying the Senate which is yet to vote will not approve this?
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   I'm saying that the president was elected on a platform that had a lot to do with law and order over privacy etc.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   And so I think that the zeitgeist in at least in Washington DC right now is let's not do anything that ties the hands of law enforcement when they're trying to.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   But why would the House pass it?
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   That's a good question.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.040]   In fact, I was surprised that was passed it.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   Yeah, me too.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   I was just working on a story for tomorrow about Axios, the new outlet, which is really great coming out of DC.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.040]   You've got to explain Axios to me because it's by the guy who started Politico, right?
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   Or one of his editors.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   Yeah, in a freed gut poaching.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040]   Yeah, she starts with me.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.040]   I saw Ina goes there, which is that's given me some encouragement.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.040]   But I worry a little bit about it.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   Tell me.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040]   Well, what is their agenda?
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.040]   I've already been launched for what, like three weeks and I read their email first.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.040]   The first thing I read in the morning.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040]   You know, it's going to take five seconds.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   Well, this is their thing.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.040]   Instead of paragraphs, they do bullet points and they have scoops in those bullet points.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.040]   This is actually how it started my career in journalism, actually.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.040]   When I was at UCLA, I was a political science major.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   And I noticed that so many of my fellow political, I was obsessive reader of the New York Times and all this other stuff.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   But most students don't read newspapers.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   And I'm thinking, come on, you're international relations students.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   You should be up on what's happening in international relations.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   And so I created something just like Axios all that was on paper.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   There's your story.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.040]   There's your story.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   I summarized every major story and distributed it and sold it, basically, to other students at UCLA.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   And it was like a godsend.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.040]   So Axios had a piece that was like what you should worry about with regards to surveillance in the Trump administration.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   So I thought that was helpful.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.040]   Going forward, FISA is up for a vote by the end of this year.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:33.040]   And the executive office has tremendous powers to spy on US people within the country, FISA is foreign.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   And then there's the encryption battle that's coming back again, too.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.040]   So I thought that was a really nice bullet pointy.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040]   Here's what you should care about.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.040]   For years, I subscribed to a magazine that they called the week.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   It really was the idea was we're going to collate all of the weekly news magazines into one quick read.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   I like Metal Floss for a quick read.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:18:08.040]   And the main reporter that they have the headline name, if you care about politics, is this guy Mike Allen, who is connected to everyone in Washington and gives you kind of like they're the one that people in the administration and in Congress are reading to get their gossip.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   And he writes the Axios AM, the first thing you get.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   The one I wake up early with the baby, I'm like, all right, I'll read about politics.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040]   I'll tell you why I'm nervous.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.040]   It's things like this.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.040]   I'm reading their technology feed.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.040]   And most of this is kind of the same kind of news we talk about, except for Meat House Party, the next big Gen Z craze.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:34.040]   This is, as far as I'm concerned, an already failed app that was created by the founders of MIRCAT.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.040]   They're writing about it to yesterday.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.040]   That is weird.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   And I'm a little concerned that this might--
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.040]   That's not an ad.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   It reads like--
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.040]   Yeah, that this might be paid placement.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.040]   It certainly isn't topical.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   And so, and it's not marked as an ad.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   Maybe it just happened by accident that one of their reporters just read a press release and said let's cover it.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.040]   Yeah, they are just getting started.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.040]   I just-- I want to know more about this.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   And you know, if you care about tech, Dan Promack breaks tons of news.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040]   It's really handy that your screen is big, by the way.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.040]   Wonderful.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.040]   You can read it over my shoulder, right?
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040]   You can read it from space.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   It's like the house party of TV screens.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   It's like the house party of TV screens.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040]   Here from Axios, though, is a big story.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   Oracle has decided not to take it lying down.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   Remember, they lost that long-standing suit between Oracle and Google over Java.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   Yeah, this thing was--
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   Ultimately, the decision was a weird decision saying that it was fair use for--
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   Well, they didn't-- they didn't talk-- they stipulated that you could copyright an API, which even in and of itself seems like a mistake.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:46.040]   Even though the APIs could be copyrighted, it was fair use that Google used the API.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.040]   So what's new on it?
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   So already, it's a damaging decision.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   Oracle has filed an appeal.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:20:05.040]   So this is what I suspect is going all the way to the Supreme Court, which will be fascinating to see how the Supreme Court justices understand APIs, Java, at least in the original trial that Judge taught himself Java and wrote some code.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.040]   Which is like surprising and impressive.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   But yeah.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   And here's another big story.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:18.040]   And the picture, the picture of the week, ladies and gentlemen, from Business Insider, of the Magic League backpack.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.040]   Though, I think the CEO of Magic League tried to play it down.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.040]   So, okay.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.040]   So they brought this on themselves by being totally secretive, right?
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.040]   And getting-- what is their funding?
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.040]   $20 billion, some huge amount of money.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   It's insane.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   It's an insane amount of money.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   Billions.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.040]   Billions.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   Billions, billions of dollars.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   And only a few, so very few, select few have seen the Magic League prototype.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.040]   And it's like, you know where their headquarters are?
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.040]   They're at Disney World in Florida.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040]   So you have to like fly.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.040]   And I would say yes if they ask me.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.040]   But you have to fly to Florida to go like get their demo into real.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   You have to stay in some Mickey Mouse hotel.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:07.040]   But just to give people a reminder of just how crazy prototypes can be when Google started working on Android, where the first thing they created was an Android for the phone.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.040]   And they built a strap so that people, engineers were walking on the entire phone on their wrist.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.040]   And if that leaked out and somebody said, look, this is what their watch is going to look like, that would be--
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.040]   Absolutely.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   And the provenance of this picture is unknown.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   The backpack is funky.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.040]   The CEO tweeted, no, no, no, no, this was-- we were just measuring the room or something.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   This isn't even a prototype.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   It was like a perception device rather than a perception device.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:38.040]   However, there have been some not encouraging points about Magic Leap.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:48.040]   The video that they showed people to recruit them was completely fabricated using technology from the same folks who brought you the Hobbit, WETA, and this new scene.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.040]   You know, the one where you're walking around the office and stuff's happening.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   None of that was with Magic Leap technology.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.040]   It was all just CGI.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.040]   It was their vision.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040]   It was their vision.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   It was not--
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040]   But not clearly labeled such.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040]   It was productized.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.040]   So, but anyway, they've raised-- they've raised one and a half billion.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   They're valued at 4.5 billion.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   We will see.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.040]   This is a board meeting that's coming up soon, I think next week.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:21.040]   And one of the reasons this was a story is because people feel that the board will have to see some demo of some kind.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.040]   And so they feel like this maybe was the leaked demo, but it wasn't.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.040]   Anyway, we'll watch with interest.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.040]   I wanted to succeed.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Scoble told us last week that Magic Leap has had to back down a little bit on their claims.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.040]   They were doing this thing where you have multiple focal points, some sort of ray tracing thing.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.040]   And they were going to be 4 and they couldn't do 4 and they've got back down to 2.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040]   I didn't understand it.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.040]   You know, it kind of reminds me of this is like going way back.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.040]   I'm going to kind of date myself.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:55.040]   But Linus Torvold, after he created Linux and became like this rock star, he worked at a company for like 3 years.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.040]   And they kept saying they're going to have this revolutionary technology is going to change computing.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.040]   It's going to do a transmitter.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   Transmeta.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   Nobody remembers, right?
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.040]   Transmeta.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.040]   It was a microprocessor.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.040]   Yeah, it was like we're going to revolution.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   And then he kind of like quietly like faded.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.040]   Like he leaves like before the product ever gets released after he was there for 3 years.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.040]   Did the product get did they release it?
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.040]   I think they kind of released it and it sort of never really went anywhere.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   But it was a low processor x86 processor.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   You know what?
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   The Wikipedia entry starts with was.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Was it American?
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   It was like a hedgemet.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   This was in '95.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.040]   They had a great idea because I think.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   Crusoe, that was it.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   Yeah, the Crusoe.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040]   There we go.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.040]   They had a great idea because I think in many ways this was a precursor of what?
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.040]   Farm.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.040]   Farm.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.040]   Eventually.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.040]   CDN.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   Right?
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.040]   And that's kind of how I feel about magic leap.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.040]   I think that they are, they have this all this hype.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040]   They have all this investment.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.040]   For an idea that's probably ahead of its time.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.040]   Right.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.040]   And we'll probably get marketed and monetized and developed by someone else eventually.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.040]   Could be wrong, but it's really hard to see them finding a path forward.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.040]   The one vote of confidence that meant something to me was that Sundar Pashai was the one who
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   led the investment from Google.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.040]   And like he seems like a guy who doesn't get too hyped on random trends.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   Sure.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.880]   Like he seems a bit more reasonable than your average VC who's like AR is going to be
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   huge and we're going to be in the middle of this thing even if it's bizarre, you know?
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   But Duvie is also a long thinking.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.880]   He's probably, you know, they probably want to lock in that.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   They got to make some long bets.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   Right.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   And like a cynical view, you could say like that was right after Facebook bought Oculus.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.880]   Right.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   And I think if you're a VC, you're, you're, you know that certain percentage of your money,
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   like 80% of it is thrown away.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   90.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   That one out of 10.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   Right.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880]   Right.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.880]   So you're willing to make that shot.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   You make some long shots bets because well if this does hit, this could be the biggest hit
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   of the century.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.880]   As long as we're talking about Congress, apparently Yoda is back.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   I love the name.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.680]   It's the you own your devices act.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.880]   You own devices act.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880]   Yoda.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.880]   You own.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.600]   This goes along with the kind of right to repair stuff which is going on about five or six
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.600]   states we talked about.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.400]   It means yesterday from my fix it about the states.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.200]   He says the one to write your Congress critic or your member of your state legislature is
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200]   in Massachusetts.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   That's the most likely.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.760]   And he said, all we need to do is get the right to repair through in one state because
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.400]   then that will force companies working in that state.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]   It's like fuel emission standards.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   They'll publish.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.040]   Well, it's better than that because they'll have to publish their information.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.280]   They'll have to offer it for sale and you do it in one state.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.760]   You can't not do it in every other state.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   They just need one state to publish everything.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   Right.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   And then that's the whole world.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.360]   So if you're in Massachusetts right here, what do they call them in Massachusetts?
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.600]   Some arcane thing like your, you're, I can't remember.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.040]   You're Alderman, not your, yeah.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.040]   Something like that.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.240]   And might your member of the state legislature and say, please pass the right to repair act.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.800]   But this Yoda Act is actually a national bill.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   First introduced in 2014, I, I, this is an EFF article.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   They're all excited about it.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.960]   But I have to say, I agree that probably shouldn't have high hopes.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.960]   The public doesn't care.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   That's the problem.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   This overwrites.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.800]   They do release really amusing press releases.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.720]   They do it in all in Yoda voice or release.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720]   There it is.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.720]   At the start.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.720]   Get people to take them seriously.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720]   Totally.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.520]   Rota, we first wrote about when it was introduced in 2014.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.640]   It would override Ulas that limit, you know, right now when you buy something, in many
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.000]   cases you're not buying it.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.800]   You're buying the right to use it until such time as the company wants it back, which
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.640]   means you can't transfer ownership of the device.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:47.880]   And most importantly, the software, this would override those Ulas so that everyone who buys
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.280]   a second hand device has the same access to security and bug fixes the original owner
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   had.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.920]   You'd think that would be obvious.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:02.680]   But we're in a weird stage where software is in a tangible good and the law doesn't
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.320]   really, you know, completely make sense.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.280]   So support that right to your Congress, Critter.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.360]   I feel like they're busy with other things right now.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.000]   So like recess.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.040]   I want a job where I get recess.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:20.240]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.600]   I mean, fairness, they have to go back and talk to their.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   Oh, that's what they're doing.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.360]   They're getting yelled at by their constituents.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.200]   I mean, you know, where I live in Louisville, Kentucky, Mitch McConnell came back to a huge
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.240]   protest of people in his, in front of his house reading.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.440]   They found him from the event to his home.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440]   Okay.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:45.080]   So this is a nutrient in politics that is very, very bad because what's happening is that
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.320]   politicians are increasingly unable to hold public events because they get moths.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   They're getting them down.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320]   And it's like it's the T-party started.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   Yeah, I was going to say this is not a new phenomenon.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320]   The PPT party did the same thing.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.040]   But I think the biggest thing is that it's come from social media.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   Right.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.560]   So this whole idea of scrambling the conversation so that nobody can have a, you know, a clear
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   comment.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.440]   And so I think far better to go sit there, be orderly and then stand up and say, Mr.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.920]   McConnell, I am under the Affordable Care Act.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   I get my insurance.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.760]   What are you going to do to replace it would be much more effective.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.280]   I think you can make a lot of money right now just selling like shame bells.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280]   Shame.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.280]   Shame.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]   Shame.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.280]   I guess.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.840]   I don't want to see Mitch McConnell walking naked down Market Street.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   Nope.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   That would be a shame.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.960]   For many years, I've got receiving calls on the radio show about people saying, you
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.840]   know, there's this great box you can buy.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.560]   It's a Cody box streams.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.200]   All the TV shows, I get all the movies cost nothing just by the hardware.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.360]   And I've always said, you know what?
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.920]   If you're not paying for HBO, if you're not paying for shame on you, shame, then you're
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.320]   probably pirating it.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.600]   Well, there have been five arrests now.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.440]   This is the first arrest that I know of people selling fully loaded on the UK.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440]   Cody boxes.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.600]   Unfortunately, it's in the UK.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600]   Yeah, they're protecting it.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]   Yep.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.800]   The thing is in the UK, you are actually paying because you pay the life.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800]   I mean, you're not going to be paying for the license fee.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800]   Pay for it.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.440]   Your taxes pay BBC and, yeah.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   So just for the conversation.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.080]   This is not a knock on Cody, which is legal and good.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.640]   There's no compromise content on the device when you get it.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.080]   They can be modified or have add-ons that give you this capability.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.800]   Unfortunately, the arrests were in Bolton, Boodle, Cheetah, Manchester and Reel.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.800]   So yeah, I never even heard of that.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.800]   Those are great city names.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.200]   Those are really great city names.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   I thought Bolton, Boodle and Cheetah were your attorneys.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.040]   When I like the British town that has the word "upon" --
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.840]   I would hire Bolton, Boodle and Cheetah.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.000]   It's just to be clear also that this isn't for downloads.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   This is for streaming.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   This is for live TV.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:49.320]   This is the companies that took Cody, put it on a device, and then enhanced it to steal.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.200]   But these have been available in the United States as well.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.120]   I don't know if this will put a chilling effect on the companies doing this in the US.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.920]   I hope it does, because Cody's great.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.160]   And it's a shame that people see Cody and they go, "Oh, that's got to be legal."
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.840]   Can we talk about gigabit fiber?
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:05.840]   All right.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:06.840]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.840]   You added that.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.840]   You're interested in this.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   And it's actually a story you guys broke about Google.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   Yes.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.640]   And their fiber initiative.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.440]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440]   Cool.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   In Heinrich from Tech Republican CBS Interactive.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   Tease, tease, tease.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.960]   You know, somebody told me you should never tease in a podcast.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   It just fast forward.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:27.680]   Casper -- well, I love my Casper mattress.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680]   You will too.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.800]   I'm a fine retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the price because you're
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.680]   buying not from a showroom that marks it up 50, 100%.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.840]   You're buying it direct from the factory.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.680]   It's made in the US.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.560]   And these are great mattresses.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   They have done the research.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.920]   I mean, if you go read up on the mattress, all the things they did to create a great mattress,
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.840]   all the prototypes they made, it's made of supportive memory foams for a sleep surface
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.840]   with just the right sink, just the right bounce.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   It's breathable.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.840]   So you're cool.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.840]   You never get hot.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.960]   It's not like a blanket underneath you.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.760]   It breathes.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.520]   And it provides very long lasting comfort and support.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.600]   It both gives and supports.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.600]   It's hard for me to describe.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   You've got to try it.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:18.320]   And the good news is you can not in some showroom with the sales clerk staring at you, giving
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.280]   you the evil eye and the broad daylight.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.040]   No, in your home, sleep on it for 100 nights.
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.080]   If for any reason you don't love it, Casper will come.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.280]   They'll pick it up and they'll refund every penny you paid.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.240]   So there's no risk where you get a 100 night trial.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.680]   I see this now more and more with these online companies.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.880]   They realize to be without a showroom, people are reluctant, but this is such a great idea.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.880]   You can try it.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.880]   You don't need a showroom.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.840]   And what are you going to get a great mattress?
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:48.280]   Free shipping and free returns in the US and Canada.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.400]   The mattress comes in a surprisingly compact box.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.720]   We got a queen size.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.560]   For my son, I got a twin for college.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.560]   This is a couple of years ago.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.560]   Because the box was small.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.000]   If he could, he's on the third floor, no elevator.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.600]   He had to bring it upstairs, open it up.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   There's the mattress.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.240]   And it kind of inflates after you open it.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.360]   Smells great right out of the box.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.000]   You can sleep on it immediately and you're going to love your Casper mattress.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.600]   A great night's sleep just around the corner.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.200]   And all you have to do is visit casper.com/twits.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.880]   C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.200]   And use a promo code, twit, some terms and conditions apply because we're going to give
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.080]   you $50 off your mattress purchase when you use a promo code, twit.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.520]   Casper.com/twit.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:36.080]   I can't say the name of the mattress, but as a mattress, I've spent thousands of dollars
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.080]   on it.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.440]   Is this the mattress that comes in a little box?
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.440]   Yeah, Casper does.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.080]   But the other one, it does not.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.880]   Some guy comes in a truck and delivers it.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.400]   All this time, I feel bad now.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.040]   Thousands of dollars down the tube.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.040]   You could have got four--
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.040]   Casper.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.800]   Casper's for other gang.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.320]   You guys could have your own Casper's.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.080]   So the FBI.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:03.200]   I don't know what the source of this story is, but Foya, the Freedom of Information Act,
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.520]   you can request.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.040]   And I think the Foya thing is about the best thing ever to happen to journalists, right?
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.040]   Absolutely.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   Absolutely.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.040]   Best thing is ever to happen to journalists.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.440]   But now the FBI says you can't request them by email anymore.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.040]   You got to fax it in or snail mail it in.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.040]   After you get one email per day, I think.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.040]   Oh, you do.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.040]   Yes, because--
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.040]   Oh, it's not that bad.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.040]   Okay.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.040]   That's $20.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.840]   Although a lot of times, Foya's you send in $20, right?
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.200]   You'll cover the waterfront.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.560]   I mean, and this is just the ones that go to the FBI, right?
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.560]   This is not--
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.560]   Right.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.560]   Because there's all kinds of--
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.560]   Oh, every agency.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.440]   Every agency has to offer information.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.360]   And it sounds like they might-- I think some folks in the Senate are looking into this.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   Good.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   So this is a really--
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   So this is a really--
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360]   Maxine is not the way of the future.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   --of the future.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   And I'm sorry for that.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   But can you even buy a fax machine now?
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   Is it like a--
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360]   What do you get about?
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.360]   You just get an apple out of your phone.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.360]   You just get an apple out of your phone.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.400]   And then you take a picture of it, and then you try not to get too much shadow.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   Oh, my.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:08.040]   There is apparently a Foya portal, the Ifoipa portal, which is only open from 4am to 10pm
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   Monday through Friday.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:11.040]   I don't know.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.720]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720]   It's very strange.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.520]   All right, I just wanted to bring that up before we talk about Gigabit.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.120]   Now, tell me about this story that you did.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.320]   So interestingly enough, we-- so I wrote--
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:30.640]   this article for ZeeDynet column for ZeeDynet last week to start the week, which is about
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.000]   fiber broadband.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.520]   Is it a waste with 5G and Elon Musk's satellites?
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.080]   Yeah, are we going to get wireless?
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.440]   So this kind of happened in the home, right?
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:46.200]   Everybody was putting in cat 5, and then all of a sudden, why did I put the wire in?
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.600]   The wired is always better, right?
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.120]   I mean, we've got some tech here, so I know they'll speak up and say this too, right?
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.560]   If you could have wired, it's always better.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   It's more reliable.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   Yada yada.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:03.320]   That said, it is so expensive to lay fiber, and what Verizon came up against with Fios,
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:10.400]   what Google eventually came up with and why it stumbled was it's just so slow, it's so
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.960]   difficult to lay fiber.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   To dig up concrete.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.960]   Yeah, to dig it.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:19.480]   Well, and they cost something like $5,000 per sub, and there's just-- is there justification?
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.120]   I mean, they've got it down.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:23.800]   In some cases, it's $1,000.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.280]   There's a vendor that says they can do it for $5,000 to $800.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.880]   Well, in our provider, we have 10 gigabit fiber in here.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.560]   And that's from Sonic, that is everybody knows.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.760]   And I've talked to Jane, Dane Jasper is the founder and CEO, and he's been on the show.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.360]   He says, and they're still laying fiber.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.840]   He says, we can make it economically.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.800]   He said, what we need is one in five in a neighborhood to sign up.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.520]   If we get 20% of a neighborhood, that makes it economical.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.640]   But apparently Verizon, which stopped its Fios effort a couple of years ago, and now
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:59.200]   Google, which is really slowing down on Google fiber, I think under-- at the behest of Ruth
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.600]   Poor at the new CFO of--
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]   Yes.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.000]   --or at an alphabet, both seem to say, we can't make money at that.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000]   So what's the story?
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.240]   So obviously, they bought a web pass, and they went into this--
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.840]   That's the apartment building one, right?
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.840]   Yes.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.840]   That's when Ohm loves his web pass.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.760]   That's what Ohm has.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.760]   I'm going to go for Cisco, I know.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   Love it.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.760]   They say it's amazing.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   Love it.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.080]   Well, but you have to live in a apartment building built since two years ago.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.080]   It's not easy to get.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.400]   It's pretty limited.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.600]   But Google believes they can take this technology because it uses this point-to-point wireless,
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.600]   fixed wireless.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.560]   It believes it can take this technology and apply it to fiber deployments for the last
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.800]   mile, right?
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:48.600]   So instead of putting that one fiber hut, as Google calls it, where that connects to 12,000
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.880]   homes, they can put some kind of wireless sensor there, and they can beam it.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.960]   And so they feel like they can go faster.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.640]   So that was an opinion piece.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.240]   But in the process of doing this, one thing that we discovered was Louisville is one of
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.520]   the cities where fiber has been coming, where I live.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.160]   But it's coming from AT&T.
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   So well, there's two.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   So AT&T and Google Fiber have been in an epic battle in Louisville.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.160]   Right.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.160]   Starting in Austin.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160]   And then--
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160]   They're battle started in Austin.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.160]   And in Louisville, now they are-- that's where they're really adding each other's through.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   You're going to get doubled fiber.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   Wow.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.760]   You're going to have $5 internet.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.160]   So what happened, though, was Louisville was one of the cities they paused.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:35.000]   So Louisville passed legislation, One Touch Make Ready, which let any-- let Google and
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.120]   any other fiber provider use AT&T's lines.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.400]   So AT&T did a big lawsuit against them over this.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.480]   So that's why Louisville became ground zero in the courtroom.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:56.400]   But it's also-- so last week, or at the beginning of February, Google quietly moved Louisville
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.000]   from the potential cities, which have all been paused, to upcoming.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.240]   And it's the first one since they paused.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.240]   And guess whose eyes noticed that?
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.240]   That was exciting.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:12.640]   And so we started asking around about it and found that Google, you know, a lot of signs
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:20.200]   from a lot of different sources that Google had been preparing to launch in Louisville.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.440]   And what we found out at the same time was AT&T, at the same time we got wind of this.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440]   AT&T also got wind of this.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.160]   And they had slowed down their fiber deployment.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.360]   Once Google wasn't coming in anymore, you know, they had kind of quit.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.840]   And we had searched for months to try and find one customer who AT&T had said they had
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.880]   10,000 people who were available to get it.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.520]   We could not find one customer in Louisville who had it.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:49.400]   And this had happened in other cities too, Austin and a few others to the point that some
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.600]   had written that AT&T makes these big announcements, but like try to find a customer.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:55.600]   It's really hard.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.960]   And so like TechDirt wrote--
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.040]   Is it really disinformation to scare Google away?
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   Exactly.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.560]   TechDirt wrote that it's less fiber to the present premises than fiber to the press release.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   I like that.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560]   I like that.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.560]   And so we found three customers, but we also found a bunch of contractors.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.840]   And they said now all of a sudden, because what we had noticed was they had stopped building
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.520]   out fiber once in Louisville.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:27.000]   And so we-- but AT&T apparently got wind of this that Google is now coming to Louisville.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.560]   And last week, they started hiring tons of contractors and telling them, if you can't
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.360]   move fast enough, we'll find somebody else that we're putting fiber in essentially every
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   place.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:40.720]   Because what Google is about to roll out in Louisville, according to these reports, is
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.000]   it's mixed gigabit and wireless.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.080]   It's next generation infrastructure where it's trying to combine the two of them, which
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.000]   is quite a-- it's a new infrastructure.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.560]   Obviously, it's a lot different than what the web pass has done in San Francisco and
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.480]   Boston and other cities.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.840]   But it will be interesting to see.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:08.840]   And then at the same time, you have 5G, you have satellite, the satellites that Elon Musk
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.240]   and others also are talking about doing.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:16.440]   And so obviously, it's needed.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.240]   And Google, being involved, has spurred on competition.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.920]   And so-- but it'll be interesting to see AT&T says they're building, all of a sudden Verizon
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.720]   says they're building again, you have one's like Sonic.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.720]   What's the one that you guys have on it?
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:29.720]   Sonic, yeah.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:30.720]   It is Sonic.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.280]   Well, there's another one that I haven't heard anybody talk about that I discovered
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   on my own.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.120]   My son got an apartment in Roseville, California, which is north of Sacramento.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.560]   And one of the options was gigabit ethernet.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.560]   And we're like, what?
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.560]   Who's providing that?
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.480]   It's called Consolidated Communications.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.960]   They rolled out in Roseville first.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.040]   They're next going to take over Sacramento and they're going to move into the Bay Area,
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:51.480]   according to their plans.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.120]   $75 a month for gigabit ethernet.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   That's great.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.120]   Any of those blistering--
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.120]   Blistering fat charges.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.120]   Wow.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.920]   I know that's incredible that they charge 40.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.680]   Actually, some people here from Atlanta, Google Fibers have been there and some other-- anybody
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.280]   you have any fiber?
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.280]   No.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.280]   No.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.280]   Only two people have it.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.640]   But I feel like this is the answer to your question.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.840]   Like, should we just wait for Elon Musk to do the satellites?
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.840]   No.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.840]   We should have lots of competition.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   But that's the key.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   Exactly.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.840]   Without Google Fibre, though, if Google Fibre doesn't press, will the competition be
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.840]   there?
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840]   And I think the answer is no.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]   We've seen that with AT&T.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.800]   As soon as Google Fibre announced they weren't doing it, they stopped building.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   And we couldn't find a single customer.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.800]   And so I think Google Fibre still--
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.840]   Is that because it's hard to make money at that business?
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.640]   Is that really the problem or what?
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640]   What do they not want it?
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   Why do they not want to do it?
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640]   It is hard to make money.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:49.240]   And yet, there's these little companies like Consolidated and Sonic that are doing it.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.880]   I would love to get to the bottom of that.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.240]   The economics are hard.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.720]   There's no doubt that the economics are hard.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.720]   If you do it in small--
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.160]   You know where it's hard?
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.280]   It's hard where there's competition.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.600]   If you can't get a big chunk of the market--
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.600]   Can't dominate it.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.760]   You can't dominate it.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.240]   And that's what happened with cable.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.080]   And that's why the FCC gave cable franchises.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.080]   Lopalese, yeah.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.320]   Because the infrastructure is so expensive, you've got to dominate.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.000]   You've got to own the market.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.040]   Speaking of satellite-based wireless, it's kind of a funny story that I noticed.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.360]   My brother-in-law is a developer in Santa Barbara, California.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.720]   He's got a friend losing a foothills way beyond any sort of internet connectivity
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   you can get.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:32.320]   So he aimed a satellite dish to share his home Wi-Fi with this person who's like three
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   miles away.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   It's generous.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.560]   And they just matched up these satellite dishes.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.800]   The person has had sharing his Wi-Fi for a long time.
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.480]   And it's like, it works great.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.320]   I'm like, wow, that is weird.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.120]   More people should do that.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.760]   Plus you get fried chicken every time a bird flies through it.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.760]   You get dinner.
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:50.760]   It's free.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.000]   I'm sure it's microwave though, right?
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.600]   Just I'm not one of what a lot of microwave beams flying around.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:06.760]   But I guess the other question is the-- because the fiber really only works in metro areas,
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760]   right?
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760]   And so--
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:09.760]   You have to have population density.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.320]   That's where 5G and satellite are going to play a really cool role.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.960]   Ironically and sadly.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.600]   But this has always been the case where you really could use it, especially wireless
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.960]   technologies in rural areas where they don't have the population density.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.840]   But inevitably, it happened with my Max too.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:28.240]   It rolls out in the cities because everybody wants to make the most amount of money.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.800]   What is a state of 5G?
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.440]   Is that just completely marketing?
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440]   No.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440]   Or is it actually coming along?
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.880]   It's actually a lot more.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.520]   I saw some demos at CES this year that were legitimate.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:42.600]   They were wireless 5G signals.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.160]   What is the technology for 5G?
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.600]   It sounds like it's a basket, like a market basket of different things.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.600]   I mean--
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600]   It's not one--
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:57.240]   There's still throwing everything in-- LTE and 4G were still on-- 5G is a marketing term
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.240]   certainly for--
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.400]   Just like LTE, long term evolution.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:01.400]   That doesn't mean anything.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.800]   And for a long time, 4G was, well, 3G, but plus.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.200]   3 and 1/2 G and all of that.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.200]   I mean--
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.840]   Is there a definition of 5G that is like--
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:12.840]   A standard?
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.840]   No.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.560]   It's not a rock solid standard yet.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560]   There's still throwing a lot.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.160]   Here's what the next generation mobile networks alliance, Mugding Mug, says.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:25.400]   Data rates of 10 megabits per second for tens of thousands of users.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.200]   Data rates of 100 megabits per second for metro areas.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.000]   A gigabit per second on the same office floor.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.760]   In other words, it's obviously very distant dependent, right?
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.760]   Yes.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.400]   Several hundred thousand simultaneous connections for massive wireless sensor networks.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:43.600]   That's one of the purposes of 5G is Internet of Things, Small Devices Sensors.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.240]   Spectral efficiency significantly enhanced compared to 4G.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.160]   That's good news because you--
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.920]   Spectrum is limited.
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.520]   Coverage improved, signaling efficiency enhanced.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.960]   And 1 to 10 millisecond latency.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.960]   Wow.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:44:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:00.960]   Which is a lot less than a LTE.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:01.960]   So this is what the standard--
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   But it has five or six--
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:04.440]   Five or six, two to three second latency, right?
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.040]   So it's down in the same ballpark.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.640]   And even the satellites, the satellites that SpaceX is talking about putting it up, they're
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.800]   at basically 30 millisecond.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   30 seconds.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   You can't do it with a satellite.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800]   Well, that's good for a satellite.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   That's really good.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.200]   And that's what most of our good connections are now.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.200]   That's what's the only thing that is.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.200]   Today.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.200]   Right.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.200]   20 to 30.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.200]   Where satellites today is more like 6 to 800 milliseconds.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.800]   Why do the satellite projects always seem to fail though?
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.800]   Remember Teladizic?
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.160]   Bill Gates was going to have the entire planet wired by 1999.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.800]   See, that's what Elon Musk does now, right?
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.680]   We're just going to do the whole planet.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.880]   Although he's worried that the Chinese are going to shoot down his satellites.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.800]   He's like-- because they have actually blown up since satellites, right?
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.120]   Are they geostationary?
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.120]   So they're not--
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120]   They're not--
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.240]   They're just putting 4,000 of them.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.240]   So they're going to be--
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.560]   You know where satellites communications has zoomed forward in recent years is backcountry
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.760]   access to satellite for GPS.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.800]   Like, I do trips where you're in the middle of nowhere and can't get a signal.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:17.040]   And that's not really reasonable anymore because it's so easy to bring a device.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.000]   There's this company Delorm-- I want to say Delormate because as an e-on, I think you're
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   actually supposed to say Delorm.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.880]   Yeah, Delorm is a long time GPS manufacturer.
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:24.880]   And they are just like--
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.880]   A map.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.400]   If you go hiking in the backcountry now, everyone has one on them.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.400]   And they're--
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Interesting.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.680]   At home, their families are watching their little dots go--
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.680]   Oh, you do.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.480]   You can set it up to update as often as you want.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.240]   So like, hourly is pretty frequent.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.320]   And then you see the person walking where they are.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.560]   There is no--
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.560]   This is a safety technology.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.400]   This is a safety technology.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.720]   And up till a year or two ago, the main device was a spot, which is just like a 911 device.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.440]   And this is now basically like a satellite texture and GPS thing.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.680]   And I don't know.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.720]   I feel like there's-- as long as I'm on this earth now, I will be in range.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.200]   You know, every couple of years, I think, I get inspired.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:03.200]   I'm like, you know what?
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.200]   I'm going to get a satellite phone or some way to get satellite data.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.160]   I'm sure the prices have come down.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160]   Yeah, these are--
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.360]   And these are-- no, these are-- and you can just activate them for the month you're on.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.720]   And it's like 15 bucks or something.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.240]   It's crazy.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.200]   But it's just text messaging, essentially, right?
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.280]   You can't actually get--
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.400]   Yeah, you're not supposed to live pages in my tent.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:19.920]   No.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.240]   That's what I want.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.560]   That's why are you in the tent?
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.680]   I want to be watching, but--
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.920]   There's no Netflix on this.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.920]   Look out the view.
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.160]   They're not inexpensive.
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.920]   This is a delorem in reach for $250.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.920]   That's right.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.600]   Base model.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.160]   And if you want nav, it's $300.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.640]   It's about the same size you just watched.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.840]   Do you pay-- yeah.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.960]   Do you pay a monthly?
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.800]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.600]   Yeah, you activate it.
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.360]   And there's a couple of different levels.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.840]   But basically, to get unlimited, it's a--
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.800]   I forget-- 20, 15 bucks a month.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.200]   So you're a-- you're like an out country backpacker, that kind of thing for this, right?
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.800]   Yes, I like technology and not technology.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.040]   I'm getting far, far away.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:47:59.600]   It's good stuff.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.320]   Nowadays, I would think people would be scared to do this.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:02.680]   Like--
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:03.160]   Two.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.440]   You mean I'll be out of touch?
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.800]   You mean I have no way.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.280]   So this is why this exists.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.640]   Sissy's these millennial--
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.640]   I remember a time I kind of went--
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.080]   At least I could text Google and ask them where to go.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.920]   We used to use the Thomas Guide to drive around with the--
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.160]   Love those books.
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:18.720]   This is interesting.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.040]   I wasn't aware.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.720]   But it's familiar with Spot, but that was like help me.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:25.720]   Yeah, that was like SOS send--
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.840]   Or what you can do within reach.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.840]   I think I suddenly need this, actually.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.560]   Yeah, we're going to be living in Morocco this year in Faz.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:32.640]   So what does it use?
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.880]   Iridium.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.080]   The failed Motorola geostationary satellite
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.080]   that was for set phones.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:38.880]   Does it really?
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.880]   I feel like it's kind of like a garment type thing where
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.960]   like someone else is going to make these two.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.280]   But this is like the company that's been doing it forever.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.040]   And they're good at it.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.520]   And we know what happened to the Iridium set.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.840]   But like try texting on the version I was using this summer.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.720]   Was it really slow?
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.240]   It's like--
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:52.760]   Well--
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.280]   You move up and down the keyboard with a little--
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   The middle of nowhere.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.200]   There's a white one.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.600]   You're in the middle of nowhere.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.240]   It's just changed that little version of reality.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:06.640]   A couple of summers ago, I went to Glacier Bay
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.440]   and didn't see a person for four days.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.720]   Well, this is genuine.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:14.160]   We, of course, and people who are tech TV fans from Days
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.880]   Gone By Know very well about one of our colleagues, James
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.480]   Kim, who followed a GPS into--
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.320]   this was, I guess, early days of GPS.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.400]   This was about 10 years ago.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.920]   Yeah, for some reason that story just triggered something
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:27.680]   in my head recently.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.520]   And I went and reread all this stuff about it.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.480]   And it's so crazy to think about--
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.120]   I think it was in 2006 that it happened.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.120]   It wouldn't happen today.
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.880]   And it's-- no, it's just different.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.480]   Well, the GPS mapping system said, oh, this
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.440]   is a perfectly good road.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:39.960]   This is fine.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.640]   It's a road.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.440]   So they followed it, got stuck.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.880]   He had his two children with him.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.760]   And his wife.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:47.640]   And his wife.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.920]   And they had some food, some snacks,
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.040]   but they weren't-- the cell signal, there's no cell signal.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.040]   They had to-- they didn't know what to do.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.400]   They were literally burning their tires for warmth
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.880]   and finally James sadly said, well, I'm going to go get help.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.120]   And there you go.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.080]   And he passed away in the snow trying
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:09.040]   to get help for his family.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:09.560]   Yeah, he died at a close.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.760]   One of my co-workers.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.600]   Seen it.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.520]   So boy, you're right.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.680]   That's something that probably, I hope,
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.040]   will never happen again.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.000]   Yeah, I mean, but we're just in a time
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.360]   when that's changing, right?
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.240]   You also have the Malaysian airlines
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.600]   going away and next year--
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.400]   Yeah, they never did.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.080]   They'll be like--
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:26.680]   I've never found that.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.440]   A satellite picture taken of every place
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.120]   on the globe every day or every hour.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.480]   We're living in increasingly documented privacy free world,
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:38.680]   but there are some benefits to that.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:39.840]   Let's take a break on that note.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.240]   I want one.
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.040]   You know what technology is good for, though?
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.280]   Actually, really good for is buying tickets online.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.400]   If you want to see somebody--
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.280]   Previously.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.680]   Don't play that.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.240]   I'm talking here.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.160]   I'm working here.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.480]   Actually, you know, let's do that first.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.680]   That's a good idea.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.840]   That's a good-- I forgot all about that.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.000]   Well, you know, we have a staff.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:05.960]   They're very sweet.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:08.440]   They work very hard on making these little movies
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.480]   about what happened during the week.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.520]   And I always forget to play them.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.280]   So let's do it.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.280]   Let's see what happened this week on Twitch.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.120]   Previously, on Twitch.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.080]   OK, Google.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.440]   Play medieval music.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.200]   Here's a music station called Folk Metal.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.200]   Folk Metal!
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.080]   OK, Jarvis, stop!
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.160]   iOS today.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.760]   National nightmare is over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.480]   Finally, Jason will get his Pixel back,
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.400]   and you'll get your iPhone back.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.920]   What I realize at the end of the month is,
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.480]   I mean, it's just another OS that does the same darn thing.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.040]   They get amazing battery life out of this.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.960]   I, out of sheer laziness, have gotten into the habit
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.760]   of not plugging it in at night, because I knew
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.680]   it would make it to the next day.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.800]   All about Android.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.640]   Is there anything that just like did not
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.840]   work on Android that really frustrated you,
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.440]   that you just really missed from iOS?
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.920]   Well, I missed-- I messaged, really.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:06.040]   But there's nothing else that everybody uses.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.480]   Tech news today.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.560]   The Wall Street Journal reports on a new handheld device
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.520]   that will tell you if you smell bad, a gadget called
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.640]   Koon Koon.
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.280]   It connects with a smartphone app, which will tell you
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.520]   whether or not you stink.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.800]   If you think that you would need a dedicated device
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.400]   to tell you whether you smell, you smell.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.440]   That's my guess.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.000]   Right.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.360]   Quit making the world safe for technology.
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.560]   But not making it if you ever had an Android phone?
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.840]   But I've always been a Mac user.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.120]   I was just forced into using Android.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.520]   And I don't hate it.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.960]   That's the praise we're looking for.
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:44.960]   I don't hate it.
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.120]   I do hate this watch.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:47.240]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.120]   She hated the Android Wear watch.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.000]   She said, do you have anything less crappy?
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.360]   I said, no.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:54.200]   No.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.880]   Here's Megan with a look at the week ahead.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.640]   Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be watching
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:00.720]   in the week ahead.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.520]   Recode holds a big conference out here in California
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:07.200]   featuring speakers like Apple's Dancing Executive, Eddie Q,
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:10.400]   and friend of the network Ben Thompson from Stratecary.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400]   And this isn't just any conference.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.040]   It's one of the fancy ones with a company chef.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.680]   T-Mobile will release earnings on Valentine's Day of this week
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:21.080]   in case the announcement is bad.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.560]   They will also aim to distract customers
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:27.000]   by bringing back their free pizza deal for subscribers.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.080]   Starting this week, customers can claim one free, large,
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.760]   or pan single-topping pizza every month
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.080]   by logging into the T-Mobile app for a week.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.040]   500 Startups Demo Day is also this week.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:40.680]   The accelerator for new companies
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.960]   will show off their latest crop to investors.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:46.000]   And finally, Omelik is bringing together
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.920]   some of the greatest minds in AI for a conference
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:51.560]   in San Francisco that aims to address the challenges
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.360]   of a future where artificial intelligence is the new black.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.440]   Jason Howell and I will cover all of this
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.920]   in a whole lot more all week on Tech News Today,
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.360]   each and every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.040]   And that is a look at the week ahead.
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.960]   Thank you, Megan Maroney from Tech News Today.
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:10.120]   I love the hashtag for the GigaOme AI event.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:10.720]   What was it?
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.360]   Giga O'Mye.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.720]   Maybe that's just-- if you read it differently.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.640]   Our show today brought to you by Seek Geek,
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.120]   the best deal on sports concert and theater tickets
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:26.120]   with Seek Geek, buying tickets online for sports and concerts.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.840]   It's always challenging and get them
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.200]   from a lot of different venues.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.880]   It's always been hard to find the best deal for the show
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.120]   or the game you want to go to.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.960]   And none of the older ticket sites
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.720]   have any incentive to change that.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.840]   But Seek Geek is different.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.640]   They've come along and created an amazing app.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.920]   I use it now all the time.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:47.480]   I like to make it easier than ever for you to buy and sell
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.560]   tickets.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:51.200]   Seek Geek, you'll love this.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.120]   Everything about Seek Geek is designed
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.360]   to make life easier for fans.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.000]   They do the price comparison for you
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.320]   by searching multiple ticket sites.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.200]   So you're going to get the best deal available.
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.800]   And Seek Geek wants to get you the most bang for your buck.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.600]   So every ticket on Seek Geek is given a grade based on value.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:11.840]   So you know if you're overpaying for a bad seat or more
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.720]   importantly, you'll see underpriced seats
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.400]   to be able to find deals that fit your budget.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.040]   And I've got a $20 rebate off your first Seek Geek purchase.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.440]   So what you need is the Seek Geek app on iOS or Android.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.800]   Go to the Settings tab and add the promo code TWIT.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.320]   And you will get $20 after you make your first ticket purchase.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.880]   So this one's on me.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:33.880]   How about that?
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:38.960]   Seek Geek, go to the iOS store or the Android Play Store,
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.280]   get the Seek Geek app.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:43.160]   And in the settings add the promo code TWIT for $20 off.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.800]   You'll like it too.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.800]   What we decided, at least tonight, is that we want to see more live music.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.320]   That's great.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.320]   I love live music.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:52.400]   And when you see it, you go, why don't I hear more live music?
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.520]   We had live music in studio a couple of weeks ago.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:56.160]   It's like, we want to see more live music.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:01.000]   So we just go to see every Wednesday, say, what go and go see?
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]   Sometimes we'll go out of town.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.440]   Like maybe there'll be a great concert in Louisville.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.000]   And I'll just come visit you.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.040]   Good Philharmonic.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:09.080]   And there you go.
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.280]   Yeah, folk metal.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.320]   Folk metal.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:13.480]   Love it.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.240]   Apple, I don't like this story.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.120]   I hope this is fake news.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:18.400]   Is it fake news?
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.880]   Apple iCloud keeps any browser history
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.520]   delete going back more than a year?
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.280]   There's been a lot.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:31.960]   This comes from Elcomsoft, which is a Russian hacking tool creator.
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.040]   But I think this is related to the story about Apple keeping
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.440]   your contacts in the cloud and your history of your messages
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.480]   and so forth.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:42.840]   This is probably a setting.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.160]   Yeah, by default, the browser, if I remember right,
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.560]   somebody can confirm this.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.480]   But their browser keeps your browsing history forever.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.440]   It wants to sync.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.760]   So you can sync it.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.280]   So you get a new device and your browsing history is in there.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.200]   So first thing, if I have a new Mac as I go in and I turn that off.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.320]   Yeah, whenever I see an alert saying,
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.480]   do you want to do something with I?
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.080]   You say no.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.040]   No.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.920]   Vladimir Kothilov, who's the CEO at Elcomsoft,
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.920]   said that iPhone keeps a separate iCloud record called Tombstone.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:17.720]   OK, that's suspicious right there.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:23.160]   In which deleted-- it knows their deleted web services or visits were stored.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.080]   He said he came across the issue by accident
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.560]   when he was looking through Safari history on his own iPhone.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.760]   And he used their break phone breaker software
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.880]   to extract data from the linked iCloud account and found it deleted records going back a year.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.200]   Now, in Apple's favor, they call him cleared, not deleted.
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:41.200]   Does that help?
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.520]   No.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:46.240]   Kothilov said a year may be forever.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:48.880]   I bet it's just forever.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.080]   That's the Safari browser.
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.240]   I just thought--
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:52.760]   What's that?
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.760]   Always has.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:57.440]   Oh.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:59.600]   It's Russian saying, stop talking.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.280]   Yeah, just by loading this article.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.160]   I apparently have triggered something bad.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:11.320]   I think all the Safari versions keep your history forever by default.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.320]   And you have to turn that off.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.720]   So definitely turn off the iCloud.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.600]   And by the way, we should point out-- and I point this at every time.
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.600]   But I think Apple really doesn't want people to remember or realize this--
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.840]   that Apple has the key to your iCloud stuff.
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.640]   Your stuff may be encrypted, and it's encrypted by a key.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.760]   But Apple has the key.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.760]   Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to do all this selective syncing stuff.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.240]   That's true.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.560]   And that means if they receive--
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.160]   Not that my message there, right?
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:36.220]   As well?
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.920]   Bad news.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:42.400]   And if they got a subpoena or a warrant, or maybe they just felt like it,
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.160]   they could give that information to law enforcement.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.800]   And a malicious-- I don't think Apple would just spy on you for fun,
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:50.720]   but a malicious employee, a rogue employee, he could.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.400]   So this is no different than a lot of cloud services, drop boxes.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:53.560]   Right.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.200]   Also, what if somebody hacks Apple, right?
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.000]   And then they can put Apple to get it.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000]   Well, we've seen that before.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000]   Remember?
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:58:59.760]   You've got stuff.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.880]   Remember those pictures from famous movie stars?
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.360]   Mm-mm.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.200]   Do you trust Google?
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:06.880]   Maybe you shouldn't.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.120]   Google has added a--
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.080]   this is from the register, the privacy.
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:13.080]   What would they call them?
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.280]   Walks at the register.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.120]   Chrome 56, the latest version of Chrome, which
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:22.000]   came out at the end of the month, added something
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.320]   that they're calling a Bluetooth Snitch API.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:32.160]   With Chrome 56, according to Google, your web app
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.160]   can communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:38.560]   in a private and secure manner using the web Bluetooth API.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:41.200]   In other words, you don't have to pair with light bulbs,
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.720]   toys, heart rate monitors, LED displays,
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:46.720]   just a few lines of JavaScript.
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:48.840]   And you can query all of these devices.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:55.040]   Google says it's TLS, and users have
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.280]   to allow the connection with a touch or a mouse click.
[01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.280]   So that's good news.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.040]   But it is kind of built in.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.640]   And how long before somebody figures out
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.840]   a way to get around the click?
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:06.840]   Sleeved the front door open.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:07.480]   It's fine.
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.760]   And can you turn it off?
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.760]   Probably not.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.760]   Unlike your iCloud stuff.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:19.040]   All right, this is all depressing.
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:26.280]   And I'm afraid I don't-- you have anything that I've missed
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:28.880]   that's really good is the Beats X headphones will be here.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:29.400]   How about?
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:29.960]   So I go ahead.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.080]   You'll have Beats X.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:31.800]   That's kind of interesting.
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.680]   What about the Amazon Go, the cashier-free Go stores
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:38.320]   that may only need six million employees?
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.200]   I saw that too.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:41.120]   That wasn't-- that's not the happy story.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:41.560]   That's not the only one.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.680]   That's your Amazon.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.400]   Now Amazon says we're not in the business
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.120]   put people out of work, and we aren't going to probably
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.120]   put these stores everywhere.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.400]   But these are the stores that they were prototyping in Seattle.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.200]   I think there's only one.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.120]   Where you walk in, you use a barcode on your phone to say,
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:55.840]   it's me.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.000]   And then the cameras and sensors in the store
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:58.720]   will follow you around.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:00:59.600]   And you want anything?
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:02.440]   You just take it off the-- it's kind of like going to Vegas
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.760]   and buying-- using the mini bar.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.440]   It goes, oh, you took a sandwich.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.800]   And then you walk out the door, but you're automatically
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.280]   charged.
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.840]   Amazon's worked really hard on this to say, look, we're not
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:15.360]   trying to minimize the number of employees.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.440]   We're trying to provide better service.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.280]   I think as a user, I would like it.
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:22.000]   I mean, I think who wouldn't like that.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.320]   That's the lines that the grocery stores kind of the worst
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.560]   part about going.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.080]   They've said that the jobs are going
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.960]   to be in food prep.
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.240]   Now they're going to have all these pre-prepped meals.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:38.040]   The tech industry has to, at some point, kind of just
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.280]   own up to it.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.040]   It's not really its fault.
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.040]   But all of the things that tech industry's
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:46.240]   doing about automation, machine learning, and all of this
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.160]   are ultimately going to cost jobs.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:48.840]   They are.
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:49.840]   That's what's the job--
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.080]   There was the John Deere, the 21st century, right?
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.040]   At the turn of the century, 1,940% of Americans
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:57.000]   worked in farming.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   They were wielding size.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.440]   Well, I did a story on this recently.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.040]   I tried to find the good news on the automation killing job
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:02.400]   story.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.600]   And I found-- I talked to a professor at NYU named
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:06.640]   Arun Sanirajan.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.680]   And he had some ideas that were relevant.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.200]   He used the farmer example, too.
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.240]   But he said also, we didn't have tourism 100 years ago.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.320]   And now that's a huge industry that employs millions of people
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:20.320]   and supports many world economies.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.440]   Another one he suggested where automation could create jobs--
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.960]   or AI could create jobs-- was health care.
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:31.360]   So right now, doctors do how many years of preparation
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:32.440]   before they can get their job.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.000]   And then we pay them lots of money
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.920]   to do their very specialized thing.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:38.320]   But if we had a world where AI could
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.120]   enable always on health care, then we
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.400]   would need health care technicians to just go, oh,
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.680]   your chart looks weird today.
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:47.960]   Let's work on how to diagnose that and keep you all healthier.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:50.000]   And that actually would be a version of the world
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.800]   where more people work in that industry than many, many--
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:55.920]   Does he think it's going to be a net zero?
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:57.960]   No, I don't think you can go that far.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.360]   But he-- it was a nice distraction from the baddies, baddies.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.200]   I mean, about five-- for about five weeks,
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:10.160]   approximately 11 months ago, I was in Cuba.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:12.840]   And that's an extreme example of a country
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.880]   that has maintained full employment by not automating
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.840]   anything.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.000]   I mean, you see people sweeping the streets with--
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:20.480]   Sure.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.760]   --pom fronds.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.480]   And the farmers are using ox-driven things,
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:27.680]   and they have full employment.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.400]   And living in Cuba sucks.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.320]   It sucks.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.680]   You're saying being employed is not the ticket to happiness.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:37.760]   I'm saying that if you try-- if you resist automation
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.640]   in order to employ people, there's a spectrum, obviously.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.360]   But it will never work.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.480]   But that's a communist country.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.840]   They don't pay rent.
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:47.800]   I mean, right?
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:50.360]   I mean, it's a very different situation.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.920]   There may be other reasons that sucks.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:54.520]   But my point is all these other things that employ people
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.480]   in our world that--
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.840]   Well, I prefer the life we have.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:58.920]   Don't exist.
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.960]   But I feel very bad.
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.840]   There's a lot of people.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.640]   Industrial jobs are not coming back.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.200]   The other point--
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.120]   Drivers are going to lose jobs, cashews.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.800]   My first job at a high school, a cashier McDonald's--
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.400]   I don't know if that job will exist in 10 years.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.040]   Well, robots should be making those burgers,
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:14.080]   because this robotic work.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:14.680]   It's better work.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.200]   Yeah, and that was the other point that he had, which is,
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.400]   we've been worried about this forever.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.600]   But the fact that technology improves on the jobs
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:22.680]   that we have today doesn't mean tomorrow's jobs are--
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:23.480]   Help is right.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:24.240]   Less interesting.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.880]   And like he said, actually, I think
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:27.520]   under the Johnson administration,
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.640]   there was a committee to figure out basic income.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.400]   So this is not a new conversation.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.640]   I don't think-- is he advocating basic income?
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.280]   No, it's not at all.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:35.480]   I don't think that's a good solution.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.680]   But I do think that preparing for this,
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.760]   training for what jobs will exist in 10 years,
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.720]   is a much better plan than trying
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.120]   to bring back industrial era jobs, which
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.760]   are never going to come back.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.720]   This funny thing has happened.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:51.600]   And if you go back and look at the public dialogue
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.840]   and the Industrial Revolution--
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.340]   Exactly.
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.320]   --in their farming--
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.160]   They were freaked out in the same exact way.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.880]   They're going to know what's going to happen.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.080]   There's going to be no jobs left to do.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.800]   So maybe take some solace in looking at history
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.480]   and learning that that wasn't the case then.
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:02.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:04.600]   Do you have any idea how many blacksmiths
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.960]   are going to be out of work now?
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.160]   Like, what are we going to do?
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:08.400]   They're going to become coders.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.480]   In fact, this new-- this article in Wired Magazine--
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.480]   this is-- I'm sorry, guys, from Clive Thompson,
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.360]   the next big blue-colored job, coding.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.800]   I guess he's a data miner.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.520]   If you look at this--
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:20.040]   Yeah.
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.520]   No, I interviewed Clive about this story.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.440]   It's running tomorrow morning.
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.280]   Oh, good.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.880]   Tell us about it.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:27.800]   Well, for an example, mentioned in that story,
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:31.760]   there is a guy whose name is Rusty Justice, who employs
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:34.480]   former coal miners in Kentucky.
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.840]   I'm not sure how far from you.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:36.840]   I forget my Kentucky geography.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.440]   He just said a couple hours.
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:42.680]   Yeah, they've retrained themselves as a coding squad.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.680]   And they brought them all in.
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.080]   And similar to one of those things
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.840]   where you'd pay to go for eight weeks
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.680]   and get some kind of a vocational credit
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:54.040]   that you can employ yourself, except they actually hired
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.680]   the people, brought them in, trained them,
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:57.520]   and now they're working as a team to get--
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.000]   This company is called BitSource.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:05:59.720]   Yeah.
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:03.440]   And so Clive's point is we make a lot of hype
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:07.280]   about the coding genius staying up 72 hours
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.560]   to make the perfect invention that we've never heard of.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:12.000]   But the reality is that a lot of coding
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.400]   is running together pieces--
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.400]   You're a code monkey.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.800]   Which is not that different from a job in construction
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.320]   or plumbing.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:19.840]   But some day that logging code's going right itself.
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:21.480]   And if we think about it that way, maybe it's--
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.200]   Isn't that going to-- those kinds of--
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.920]   I asked him that question.
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:27.360]   And he said, what I'm talking about
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.680]   is the next 15 to 20 years.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.320]   After that--
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:29.840]   There's no--
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.320]   --ceptivity.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:30.840]   Yeah.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:31.340]   Yeah.
[02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:32.400]   The AI codes will write it over.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.480]   I'll give you another one too.
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:36.360]   Because one of the dirty little secrets about big data
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.360]   is that the algorithms really aren't smart enough
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.760]   to sort out all the stuff we need for big data.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.800]   Humans have to.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:43.640]   Humans have to.
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:51.080]   There are armies of people doing data sorting, data cleaning,
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:56.080]   and all kinds of things behind the IBM Microsoft Amazon.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.600]   They hire armies and armies of people doing click work.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.400]   We did a big investigative story on this
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.000]   because there's some problems with it too,
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.200]   because they're all independent contractors.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:09.160]   And yeah, it's got its issues.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.600]   And so we wrote about that, especially Amazon Mechanical
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.040]   Turk.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:17.800]   But this is creating a whole new scale of jobs.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.280]   Some people are arguing--
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:22.720]   these are some of the blue collar jobs of the digital age.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:24.640]   You know, it reminds me of the music industry
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:28.800]   where you had these superstars, these multi platinum artists.
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:32.240]   But there was plenty of kind of lower level work
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:34.120]   for just a journeyman musician--
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:34.840]   Playing at a bar.
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:35.920]   Playing at a bar or whatever.
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.800]   And those weren't bad jobs.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:41.360]   But if you looked at Metallica, they weren't Metallica-level jobs.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:42.560]   But I think there are a lot of people--
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:43.060]   What is?
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:46.840]   And I think his story is like kind of a rebranding of this idea
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.360]   that we need more coding education
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.960]   because that's where the jobs are.
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:53.360]   But to say it in this notion of calling it a blue collar job
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:54.680]   kind of shifts your metaphor.
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:55.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.280]   It's not a blue collar job.
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.480]   You're working in an office.
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.600]   Well, but this color labor doesn't have to be physical.
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:01.080]   It's not physical labor.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:03.960]   It just kind of means like a good middle class income.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:05.720]   There was an article recently saying
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.320]   that the solution to journalism's problems
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:11.080]   is that journalists need to reembrace their blue collar
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:12.280]   roots, which is interesting.
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.280]   I don't think it's a good thing.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:13.960]   I don't think it's a good thing.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.720]   I totally think it's great that we're not.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:18.600]   Well, but we are also taught a lot that, well, success
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.320]   means you're going to be getting a millionaire.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.400]   You're going to have these--
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:22.520]   And you know what?
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:25.480]   Podcaster is the next blue collar job, frankly.
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:26.560]   I mean, most people--
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.960]   Well, see, there's plenty of good middle class income.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:31.480]   That's not so bad these days.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.480]   Right.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:35.720]   But I think it's also so much, especially in tech journalism,
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:38.760]   which I know I'm a huge critic of tech journalism as it is
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:39.240]   nowadays.
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:40.440]   But everybody wants to be an access--
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.600]   You're some average by tech journalism.
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:42.600]   Everybody wants to be a star.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:43.280]   They're like, look at me.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.520]   I'm at the Apple event.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.240]   It's like, you know what?
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:46.560]   Why don't you do your job?
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:48.160]   Why don't you go find something that
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:51.480]   is not following the herd around and broadcasting
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.480]   the echo chamber?
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.400]   Think for yourself and do your own leg work.
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.520]   That's what we need in journalism.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.440]   Zig when everybody else is zagging.
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:59.480]   Yeah, that's my motto.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.000]   Do you talk about this in code blocks?
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.840]   Like, you know, making a living now.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.400]   A little?
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:05.920]   A little?
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:06.080]   All right.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.720]   I'm going to fix your shout out because I can see a shirt.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:08.880]   It's coding blocks.
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.440]   Coding blocks.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.720]   I'm trying to give him a plug.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:12.800]   And I did it wrong.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:13.600]   Coding blocks?
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:14.200]   Is that what he said?
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:14.960]   Coding blocks the box.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.480]   Coding blocks the box.
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:17.920]   Listen, every week.
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:18.920]   Right?
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.240]   Am I close?
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.400]   Anyway, hey, it's been great having Liz Gaines here.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:25.760]   She is at 6.
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.960]   There it is, codingblocks.net.
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.160]   And I asked you, is it curly braces blocks?
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:30.880]   And you said it was?
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:31.680]   It is.
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.920]   I see them.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.400]   Nice.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:33.960]   Clean code.
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:35.560]   How to write classes the right way.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.840]   Oh, this is like the real deal.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.800]   This is like actual coding.
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:39.280]   Fun.
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.840]   I was wondering if you could do a coding podcast.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.680]   Apparently you can.
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:47.840]   Liz Gaines is at 6.0db.co.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.080]   Everybody should subscribe, should get the app.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.840]   And if you're lucky enough to have an Amazon Echo device,
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:56.200]   your turn on that task.
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.120]   It's a great task.
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.560]   Can you keep me listening to one on your phone
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.160]   and then finish it on Echo?
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:00.680]   Yeah.
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.400]   The stream's about you, not like every single person
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.760]   in the world listening to the radio at the same time.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:06.520]   That's a good slogan.
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.920]   The streams about you.
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:08.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:09.960]   I like it.
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:10.480]   Thank you, Liz.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.440]   It's great to see you again.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.360]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.520]   Congratulations on your success.
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:14.760]   I don't know.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:17.320]   The stream about you sounds like a Trump Russian--
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.920]   The stream is for you.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.920]   It's your stream.
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.360]   The stream is for you.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:23.200]   Stay right there.
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.120]   Oh, I see where you're going.
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.520]   That's Mike Elgin.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.000]   Mike Elgin, he is at-- well, Mike Elgin.com.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.600]   Mike Elgin on the Twitter, plus Mike Elgin on the Google
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.360]   Plus and first.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.240]   Fastcast.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:38.280]   That cast is his podcast.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:39.480]   All about--
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.760]   It's a food in technology and sometimes food or technology.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.440]   And someday, you're going to tell us what your wife is up to.
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.160]   She is hatching a scheme that is going to be awesome.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:51.600]   Someday.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.280]   That's all I'll tell you in a couple months.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:53.960]   Talk a couple months.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.080]   Come back.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:57.440]   You'll be in Vienna or Venice or somewhere over the--
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:57.920]   Somewhere.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:58.400]   --v.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.640]   And you will come on the show and you will tell us what it is.
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:01.120]   I will.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:02.640]   Is it stealth mode?
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.000]   She's in stealth mode.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:04.960]   That's right.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.600]   Jason Heiner, always a pleasure.
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.400]   He's the guy who got me elected as president of the--
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:10.360]   It's a long time ago now.
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:12.400]   --in many years ago and I'm still serving.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:13.200]   Yeah.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.840]   It's a lifetime office.
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.760]   It's a lifetime.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.200]   Yeah, job with no power.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:18.040]   So it's good.
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.800]   Jason Heiner.com at Jason Heiner.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.000]   Of course, you can catch him on ZEADING
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.640]   at the CBS Interactive and Tech Republic.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:24.640]   Follow the Geeks, too.
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.040]   Buy the book because it's about me and my friends.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:30.560]   10 digital innovators.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.760]   Follow the Geeks, yeah.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:33.760]   And I know every one of them and I love every one of them.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.640]   It's a really good story.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.400]   I'm not even for the young woman.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.520]   I never heard of her and that's the ending.
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.280]   Maya Penn.
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:39.800]   Maya Penn.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.720]   And I love that.
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:41.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:44.760]   She was 14, a 14-year-old entrepreneur, who'd
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.960]   been an entrepreneur since she was eight when we--
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.200]   That's such a great story.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:48.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.520]   She's doing amazing things now, too.
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.080]   She's published her own book now and has been on Oprah
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:53.880]   and everything.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.320]   She's blown up just as we figured she would.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.400]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.,
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.920]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:03.080]   That's 2300 UTC.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.600]   If you like to watch live, you can go to our website.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:10.400]   Twit.tv/live or live.twit.tv or YouTube.com/trick
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:13.560]   has, yes, we're on YouTube Live and they haven't kicked us off yet.
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.240]   Celebrating our third week of not being kicked off YouTube Live,
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:19.200]   that is a big milestone.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:22.360]   I think we started YouTube Live right when the president was
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:23.320]   inaugurated.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.920]   So it'll be interesting to see who lasts longer.
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:28.840]   He's probably going to win on that one.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:31.280]   We also are available on demand after the fact.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.200]   Audio and video at twit.tv or wherever you get your favorite
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:39.360]   podcast, or tune in 60 dB and you'll hear some great short
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.720]   twit bits.
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.200]   I think our long show is too long even for your long--
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:44.320]   No, I think it's on there.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:45.000]   Is it?
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:45.480]   Yeah.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:46.200]   Oh, it's nice.
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:48.440]   This was the fastest one I've ever done.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:49.480]   It feels fast.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:50.160]   It went really quick.
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:52.760]   Believe me, this was a long-ass show.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:54.800]   Ask the people sitting in the uncomfortable chairs
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.920]   in the front row there.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.040]   This is a long-ass show?
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.200]   Yes, it was.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:00.240]   Long-form podcast.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.280]   Long-form, very long-form.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.640]   We're still doing the survey last few days.
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:07.160]   We're going through the end of the month.
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:10.440]   So I guess a couple more weeks left if you would like to
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.760]   take a couple of minutes out of your day.
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:14.000]   And I know it's a busy day and I'm very grateful if you go
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.240]   to twit.tv/survey.
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:17.880]   It literally is just a couple of minutes.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.600]   It's a much shorter one in the past.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.640]   It helps us sell the show so we understand a little bit
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:22.160]   better about you.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.600]   But it's anonymized.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:25.960]   We don't want your personal information.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.880]   We're not telling people about you personally.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:28.520]   Do you love it?
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.080]   Support it.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.280]   Yeah, who listens to twit?
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.440]   Is it men?
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:31.960]   Is it women?
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.320]   Is it college graduates?
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:34.240]   Who is it?
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:34.680]   That kind of thing.
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:36.800]   I listened to Twit in 18 different cities last year.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:37.560]   I counted that.
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:38.920]   I meant to tell you-- I've been meaning to tell you that.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.320]   How did you count that?
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:40.720]   Just did?
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:43.360]   Just because I was in 18 different cities and I listened
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.240]   every one of them.
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:45.240]   One of them.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:45.760]   Thank you.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.680]   I go walk, whatever city I'm visiting.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:49.080]   I love to walk in whatever cities I'm in.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.520]   You too, cities I love to walk in cities.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.000]   And I always listen to podcasts and Twits.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000]   Twits, I always listen to Twit.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.480]   Well, I hope you all always listen to Twit.
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.760]   I thank you for doing so.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:13:59.920]   And we will see you next time.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:03.560]   But meanwhile, I have to say another Twit is in the can.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:04.560]   This is amazing.
