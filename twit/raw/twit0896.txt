[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:44.720]   It's time for "Twit" this week at Tech, the show where we talk about the latest tech news.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.600]   Oh, I like this panel. We finally got around to getting a win to Dow on the show. Of course,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.560]   you see her every Tuesday on all about Android. She's a developer, works right now. When she's
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.760]   working at Adobe, she's at Android Guru. We thought, well, with the new announcements from Google,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.280]   we probably should have somebody who knows what's going on. Welcome, win. First time on "Twit".
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.840]   Thank you for joining us. Yeah, thank you for having me, Leo. I'm very excited and very
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   nervous, but honestly, really excited. Nervous. No. That's silly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're amongst
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.840]   friends. I know. I'm sort of... I will keep it down to a level. I did have like three cups of coffee
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.920]   this morning, and I was awake for the show. So this is going to be like win on like like, like
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.400]   at an 11. Win 2 to have the coffee achiever has joined us and is ready to... That was my achievement
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   this morning. Like ding, like 500 milligrams of caffeine achieved. Like, okay, cool, great.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.760]   So glad. That's just a sign that just goes over your head with the achievement and real life.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   Exactly. Just like ding. Oh, look who that is. Haven't seen Ben Parr in a long time. Serial
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.240]   entrepreneur, his current startup is Octane AI. He has a brand new podcast with a Hollywood star.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.360]   It's called Business Envy. You're doing with Greg Grunberg. It's so nice to see you Ben. We
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   used to have been all the time on when he was at Mashable. Good friend and wonderful to have you
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.720]   join us. Thanks for book, Captivology. Also a really big book on all about the attention economy.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.520]   Great to have you on. Thanks for having me back. Yeah. It's going to be fun.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   And somebody was saying, what is that bot behind you? That is my company's mascot, Octi.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.560]   Octi. The cute little robot. Nice. Hello, Octi. Hello. And he's done the right thing,
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.120]   which is erase the whiteboard behind him so we don't know what Octane AI is. Long-term strategic
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.800]   goals are. But that's life. I bet there was good stuff on there, right? Before the show.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.040]   Just the best. I should have read this some more things next time. Put some secret messages in
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.480]   there. Just because then gives us something to look at. And also a long time. Always welcome,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.440]   guy. I was hoping maybe we'd get to see you in person this week. Ian Thompson is here from the
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.880]   register. He is now US editor at the register.com. But always welcome for his Britishism, if nothing
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.640]   else. Well, Santa couldn't make it up. But yeah, my legs a bit buggered at the moment. So the
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.080]   other two hours in the car to get up and back would be a bit rough. But at the same time, always a
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.280]   pleasure. Yeah, we, you know, out of friendship, it's great to see you. But honestly, we're very
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.880]   happy to do this via Zoom these days. It's, you know, it's the, I know, it's my kind of baby.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   I miss the studio vibe because, you know, when you're actually in person, I think it adds a bit more.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.040]   But yeah, that's life. What are you going to do? What are you going to do?
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.440]   So when we'll talk about the event this week, Thursday, Google announced their,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   this was kind of surprising. I had to kind of remember this is their first Android Wear watch.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.880]   They've made Android Wear for years, but they finally made a watch to go with it.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.320]   They also announced the Pixel 7, which is just kind of the logical successor to the Pixel 6.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.120]   Talked a little bit about, I was surprised actually a little bit about the tablet,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.400]   which they say won't come out till next year and showed a kind of cool little feature of the
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.680]   tablet, which is it will magnetically dock to what looks like a Nest speaker to turn it into a
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.600]   Nest Hub Max kind of your thoughts. A couple of people said that the Google event was kind of
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.680]   sonambolistic and it certainly is compared to work. Yeah, do you like that? I made that up all by
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.120]   myself compared to what Apple, what Apple's, you know, kind of hyper frenetic show off things are
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.600]   or even Samsung's Google seemed kind of, yeah, we got a phone. Here it is. What do you, you know,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.720]   even Rick Osterlo is hard for him to kind of get excited. It felt like
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.160]   I don't know. Maybe it was a jet lag, you know, since it was in New York, New York,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.360]   maybe when everyone just kind of jet lagged and still kind of feeling they were on 5am
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   California time. But yeah, I mean, I feel like Google events generally tend to have this kind
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.240]   of feeling where there's maybe just that engineering earnestness, which maybe kind of bit some
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.960]   nambolistic. Is that what you said? Yes. Sleepwalkers. Sleepwalkers. I don't know. I generally feel like
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.240]   the one thing I like is that they kind of just tell you about the product and I don't, I think
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   as I get older, I get a little bit less patient with like a lot of like pizzazz and show and
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.640]   marketing and maybe that's also just because my day as an engineer, I just like literally just
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.560]   tell me what the cool stuff is, tell me the specs and then let me kind of get back to my day job.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.040]   But yeah, I mean, I actually was pretty excited. I while you're live streaming with my co-host
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   Ron Richards for the actual show, I did pre-order both the Pixel 7 and the Pixel Watch. So it worked.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.080]   And so it worked. I mean, and it is actually kind of interesting because I am not generally a
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.800]   wearable person. I do have a fitness tracker, but I use a whoop. So it's kind of a very specific
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.280]   what do you use? A whoop. Oh, yeah. I'm not wearing it right. Yeah. This is for series.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.200]   See, series athletes use the whoop. Yeah. And it's all about data. There's no interface.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.840]   There's no nothing. It's just this like heart tracker that does and their big thing is data,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   data science and everything like that. So they're there and it also has a subscription, by the way.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.640]   So, but this is like pretty serious, but it does a lot of things that fit that does like the sleep,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.440]   recovery workouts and things like that. But I like it because it's focused. I used to use,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   I think like a couple of the Whittings watches I had where I was for a while, but I think it
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.400]   didn't quite match my style. And so I dropped it for a while when I found a whoop, which is kind
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.440]   of like, I'm a bit of a fitness nut and kind of like analytics. I've seen your Instagram. I know
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.640]   Lisa and aunt are like two of my like most consistent cheerleaders on Instagram. So I love
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.520]   the Twitter fan for that. But I kind of like that this is so focused. And what's really interesting
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.440]   to me is that I really like the whoop so much that the fact that this device doesn't integrate
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   with other things that normally I would drag a device on for not integrating with like Google
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.040]   Fit kind of like other like popular fitness things. Oh my gosh. Yeah, there's me.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.640]   There you are. It's pretty damn. I feel unfit.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.200]   Yeah, I know. I'm going to the gym right after this. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty impressive. Yeah. I know.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.840]   Yeah. So I actually haven't been that, you know, attracted or me feeling the need for a smart
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.560]   watch buddy. I think partly because I do all about Android. Yeah, I'm in the wrong a lot right now.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   Oh my God. This is so embarrassing. But hey, there's Lisa. Great. Lisa liking me. Oh yeah.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.080]   Yeah, I would like you, but it would look like I was macking on you. So I just pretend that I
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.160]   don't actually see these. Well, if it's you and Lisa, it's different. Yeah. And I, you know,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.000]   I work out with the kettlebells every once in a while. My trainer makes me do it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.160]   The we use the six put kettlebell is very puts, puts their little puts. And that is that that,
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.880]   you know, I hurt just looking at you.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.200]   If it makes you feel better, I've been sick, which maybe the listeners might hear. So I
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.520]   haven't actually worked that in about four or five days. Oh, thank God. You must feel like
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.200]   you're falling apart. I tell you it is I. So but you prefer the whoop because you're serious.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.360]   I do see because I'm Mr. Extreme with my scuba diving and my K2 climbing. I have the Apple Watch
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.880]   Ultra. You know, just don't try to repair it. This band is designed to fit over my wetsuit,
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:54.960]   which I will never wear. And when you set it up, I even the first you get says, now do you want
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.760]   us to tell you what depths and water temperature you're at? And I said, Oh, yeah, definitely,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   definitely want to know that. There's my smart watch. It's a regular watch. Although I do wear an
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.000]   aura ring. Yeah, and I forgot to wear it just like you. Well, we had dinner the other night. I asked
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.080]   you about your watch. Yeah, because it was a real watch. And I thought, well, this is weird.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.840]   Why is he wearing a watch? I don't know. I'm I'm with Ben on this. I was back in the UK a couple
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.520]   of months ago. My mom gave me my grandfather's watch. I'm getting that thing restored and strapping
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.160]   it on. It's just like, I don't like smart devices. I won't have them in the home. I don't like,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.440]   you know, the smart watch because I'm just a bit of a light that way. But yeah, an old-fashioned
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.840]   watch. Yeah, I'm going for that. Well, and that's one thing that these are never going to be air
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.080]   loose. I mean, I'm never handing my I did get okay. So when I got a new Apple Watch a couple
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.880]   of years ago, I gave it to my son who promptly gave it to his girlfriend. It is not it does not
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   have the same cache. It has resale value, you know, that's the thing with technology over time.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.520]   It dies like a year later. It's like, well, that's old. Well, yeah, but I mean, you remember the
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.000]   the Apple the gold Apple watch when it first came out that they stopped supporting a
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.480]   couple of years thousand dollar edition. Exactly. You know, it's just like way to tell that you've
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.200]   got too much money. But I mean, at least Google is getting this right with a new smartphone
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.640]   extension policy. But you know, it's yeah, that was a big deal. Under redundancy is ridiculous.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.320]   Day before or a couple of days before the Google event, it came out that, oh, if you have a pixel
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.480]   four, you just got your last update. That that three year old phone is out of date is done.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.960]   Thank you. It still works perfect. Perfect. It's like how frustrating is that?
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:50.240]   This time they announced what five years when? Yeah, three years for OS updates and then
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.600]   five years for security updates, which is really a little better. But compared to like,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.080]   iOS where I think I looked it up, I mean, I'm not an expert on the iOS phone. So you all can
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.680]   correct me if I'm wrong. But I mean, even the iPhone six and two, then 14 is still getting
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.640]   12 updates. So yeah, and then of course, like Samsung is, you know, still eating. Well, I was
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   eating their lunge is a little bit extreme, but at least Samsung kind of recently committed to
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.120]   four years, OS and five year security. So Google just feels like they're just
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.600]   again, keeping up there sleep, walking through the whole thing. A little bit. Yeah.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.200]   I saw a stat there since 2015, they've only sold something like 27 million pixel phones,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.920]   which sounds like a lot, you know, but it's it's a it's less than the Apple sales or
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.320]   Samsung sales on a quarter. It's just it feels it feels like the battle lines are already really
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.440]   drawn now in the mobile phone market. I remember like a decade ago, you know, covering like iPhone
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.560]   and Android launches, it was like blow for blow, right, you know, a battle to the death between
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.400]   Apple and Google. And now it's kind of like, okay, we have a status quo. Apple is number one,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.880]   and then different Android players combined are number two. And then can anyone even name
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.120]   a number three? Everyone has tried. Samsung has done it. Well, Samsung, I consider part of the
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   Android center, you know, and well, but if you look at manufacturers and you look globally,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.160]   if you look in the US, it's a little different. But if you look globally, Samsung's number one,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.880]   right. And then Apple with the iPhone, probably some Chinese manufacturers next,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:27.520]   Google's way down the chart. But Google to me, what they what they kind of were establishing by
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.360]   getting making a watch announcing kind of the more speaker stuff they talked a lot about the
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.120]   Google Assistant, some voice recognition on your phone, and so forth is the ecosystem play. And
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.760]   that's what I took away from this is that is now there are now three ecosystems. There's Samsung,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.840]   there's Google, and there's Apple and Google wants to play in that game.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:56.240]   I've got to say, I'd add Amazon into that because you know, I don't have a phone. They don't have a
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.960]   watch. They don't have a phone. They don't have a watch, but they do have the data. And I think
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:07.840]   looking at you rather have. Yeah, but looking at Amazon's recent plays, they're not going for
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   the hardware side of it necessarily other than the home assistants. And the robot, the iRobot
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.480]   vacuum, which I think, you know, they're saying is, I suspect maybe a little bit jeopardy because
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.040]   of regulatory issues. How interesting. Yeah, you're right. Amazon has the data, but I mean,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.600]   this is to me. When it comes to day to day handsets, yes, you're right. But well, then this is why I
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.800]   think Google has a hard time because I think normal people, I don't know, I don't know any,
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.880]   but if I knew some normal people will, you know, they say, okay, I could get a Samsung, I could get
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   an Apple or I could get a Google. Almost I would guess universally say, but the Google, they're
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.600]   going to spy on you. And I think I was really trying to create that environment where they go,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.360]   you want privacy, you want security. Don't go with those guys. Yeah, but Apple are being utter
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.280]   hypocrites about that. It's not necessarily true. Yeah, we're all about privacy. Should have a
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.920]   little asterisk there saying offer does not apply in China. Right. You know, I mean, they're anywhere
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.680]   else they're doing ads now. I mean, Apple has plenty of first party data. There's no lack of it.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.800]   They have done incredible branding around like it's market privacy and that yeah, and like opting
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.360]   out and those are good things. But there is definitely still, yeah, they want to do more ads.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.080]   They're, you know, taking away market share specifically from Meta. That is the one who's
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.560]   really getting punched in the face because of it. Yeah, Meta does not have a system play.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:41.200]   For sure. Oculous is was is been their go for it, but we're not yet at the point and we never
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.040]   may never be at the point where VR headsets or even AR headsets are anywhere close to
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.920]   mainstream to the phone. You know, Mark made that bet years ago that he could build a whole new
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.800]   hardware ecosystem and it hasn't panned out yet. But what other choice did he have? He saw what was
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.920]   going to happen with Apple years ahead, but there was almost nothing he could do. He didn't do a
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.200]   Facebook phone. Amazon tried and failed. He tried to do a Facebook phone. I was there. It was like
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.160]   an HCC phone. I was there for the launch event and it flopped and it's the same thing. Amazon
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   tried to phone and it flopped. There's just a whole pile of flopped phones. I'm sure we could find like
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.240]   there's got to be museums just flopped phones that fail. Throw the Microsoft kin in that pile and
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:32.560]   you know, yeah. So does it make what I'm saying is it makes sense that there are right now three
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:39.680]   big Ecosa? Yes. There's a huge market for cheap Android handsets, but among the premium buyers
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.800]   and the premium phones, there's three ecosystems, Samsung, Google and Apple.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.720]   When do you think Google has a perception problem?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:57.920]   I think they have, I think they're trying to figure out how to find a niche. So with Apple
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.000]   and with Samsung, right, they kind of had like the big three device that we tend to say. So Apple,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   with its amazing kind of integrated ecosystem, you have a watch, you have a phone and you have a
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.480]   tablet, right? All kind of like super well integrated. And I think Samsung is kind of competing and is
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   in more position to compete with Apple because of their market share, right? With a watch, a tablet
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.480]   and a successful phone. And I think I can't help it. Google must know that there's no way that they're
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.280]   going to ever catch up to Samsung. It just does not make sense with Samsung kind of already being
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.880]   ingrained as like the reason that Android is the number one, like mobile operating system in the
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.600]   world. And just their market share and just the fact that they got in there early with like kind
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.920]   of going through carriers. I just don't think there's any chance for Google to conceivably compete with
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.120]   them and to get to the level where Samsung and Apple is. But I think kind of going to what Ian said,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.400]   I think maybe they need to shift their ecosystem a bit and kind of with the home and the pixel tablet,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   especially with the pixel tablet, not necessarily being an iPad or an S8 tab kind of level where
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.000]   the foot where there's a lot of appeal to media productivity, kind of high in creators,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.560]   where it's more of a home device. And maybe, and that's where kind of maybe the Venn diagram
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.760]   of ecosystems kind of starts to circle with Amazon is like maybe they're trying to make their ecosystem
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.800]   something a little bit unique. Because I just feel like they kind of were in this space. And
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.720]   it's like, huh, yeah, the numbers aren't working out. So what can we leverage? What are our strength
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.440]   that we can kind of make our ecosystem a thing and actually have it be successful? I don't know if
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   it's perception problem. I think it's like they're in a weird spot. Like, because Lord knows Google
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.840]   has been begging developers, third party developers to make amazing flagship like showcase large
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.400]   screen apps. And we're not doing it. Like, that's like a whole other rant aside about that.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.320]   That was another pitch when they're talking about the tablet is, oh, and we've been working for
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.400]   years to get developers to do tablets. And that's why yeah, tablets have never succeeded.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.440]   They just have the apps. Yeah, it's a chicken and egg problem. And like, you know, back when I
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.680]   think around honeycomb time when tablets first, yeah, people were really excited. Honeycomb was a
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.920]   tablet. It was I had some of them. Yeah. Yeah. You can put so many dead Android tablets around
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.360]   the house. Actually, you know, I got two glasses. What was the seven inch tablet that Google did?
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.280]   That was a seven. That was a way that it was amazing tablet. And actually in hindsight,
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.560]   it wasn't much bigger than the modern smartphones, but it was no it was good. It was just right. I
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.760]   liked it a lot. Good Kindle size tablet. Yeah. Yeah, where did they go wrong? 100.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:43.120]   This is by the way, the the epitaph that's going to be on Google's tombstone. Where did they go wrong?
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.680]   Because not that Google's close to death store, Facebook, maybe, but not Google,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.240]   but they and that's only because they make so much money in search that they can, you know,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.920]   fritter it away. This money out. Yeah. There's a there's a branding thing because like in the end,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.640]   the like quality between the phones, I don't think is all that different, right? Like you can
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.880]   get pretty much everything done. In fact, you could argue the pixels six and seven have the best
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   cameras of any smartphone. It's a good idea. It's a branding thing. Yeah. But that's what I'm saying.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.920]   I think people I think real people look at Google and say, no, they're an ad company. I don't trust
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.040]   them. Yeah, Google really missed a trick on this one because you remember when the first Nexus
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.960]   phones came out, they were the stripped down Android operation system. No, no bloatware. Nothing
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   else. Yeah, but he loves them. I don't know if real people love them. Yeah, but I mean, if you get
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.920]   a Samsung phone, it's got so much crap where on there. Oh, it's horrible. I cannot remove.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.400]   And people love it. That couldn't they could have made that a unique selling point for the
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.280]   for the Nexus and then the pixel, but then they decided, right, let's jack up the pixel price
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.760]   and put a skin on Android. And they haven't really decided what they wanted to do with it. It was
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.920]   just like be like Apple, just be like Apple and get people to pay a lot of money. Well, to some
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.000]   degree, that's not going to work. Samsung's the anti Apple. I think a lot of Samsung owners
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.240]   are actually buying it because it thumbs its nose at Apple. It's certainly that's their ad
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.560]   campaigns, right? Even today, they still do ad campaigns mocking, you know, that I've been seeing
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.400]   this ad where the woman's on the bus with in love with her iPhone and then she sees the flip phone
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.360]   and then everything and she has to have it. Yeah, and then she sees it in a year and sees the screen.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.120]   But but seriously, that's that's how Samsung, I think sees itself. And I think probably that's
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.560]   market research says, at least in the US, the people buy Samsung are buying it because they
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.000]   don't want an Apple phone. They want something of perceived similar quality and value.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.160]   And yeah, you and I noticed that there's two different messaging apps with the same name,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:56.320]   that there's two different everything apps, browsers, everything. But we noticed it, but I
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.640]   don't think normal, I think normal people love their Samsung's every every time I meet somebody
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:06.240]   who has a Samsung, they love their Samsung's. I have to admit, I've actually been using his Efold
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:14.880]   for see, I see. Hold on, hold on. Okay. So, okay. Actually, so I've actually had a very long and I
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.360]   think a lot of Android data dollars have a long love. Well, not even love hate relations with
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.800]   Samsung. Yeah. A lot of that has to do with with Samsung and their custom flavor of Android and
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.720]   it not kind of conforming to stock Android. So I think, so my view is incredibly skewed by being
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.200]   an Android dev because devving for quote, just stock Android is the easiest and most straightforward
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.800]   thing. Samsung ruins our day half the time with kind of these weird bugs. And then so around June
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.280]   or July, I dropped my Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro on my sister's ceramic floor and it cracked. So I had
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.520]   a pixel. Yeah, it was not it was that sound, you know, when you dropped and you just
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:58.400]   like, oh, this is gonna be expensive. And then you look at it. Okay. So I actually had a full
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.760]   fold Z sorry, Z fold three that I got from like a Google thing. And I was like, well, crap, I don't
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.560]   have any other option. I started using it and specifically with a foldable and I, I kind of had
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.520]   to deal with it because yeah, to get something something about the Google care or something with
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:21.440]   Pixel 6. But I kind of get it now. I do and a friend of mine who works at Tonal Gabriel,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.040]   what everyone's told me like, look, if you kind of get past the bloatware, if you start really
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.720]   put the effort into setting up a Samsung, you'll love it. And I think Michelle Raman, who, you know,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.280]   is also a co-host on all about Android, has said that, you know, Samsung is great for power users.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.480]   So once once you get to that initial setup period, there's a lot that a power user can do with
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.280]   Samsung and I totally get it. I kind of feel like I'm betraying my Android native brethren a little
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.640]   bit. But I can see why people end up liking these phones and certainly in terms of the hardware,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.680]   especially this foldable device, I get it. So yeah, I mean, if somebody knows about Samsung
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:05.280]   Goodlock, they're going to be a Samsung user forever, right? I don't know. Like I, I know, I'm
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   with you. I think if you're sophisticated enough to have learned how to, I mean, Goodlock is a
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   perfect example of an app that I don't even Samsung doesn't even mention it, but it's in their store.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.280]   And the end, you know about it, aficionados go, Oh, yeah, once you get that and Bixby ain't so bad.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   Look, I'm able to use it and it does great thing. Once you get to that point, you've invested
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   say Bixby ain't so bad. These are what that's what people are saying. Oh, but you don't understand
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.520]   Bixby is how I interact with the phone and it works really well. And I do think that this is that
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:47.200]   Samsung aficionado speaking people buy into it. And the idea fact, right? People look,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.040]   Ikea furniture is a miserable experience. But if you build it, you will love it because you put so
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   much of your heart into it. That it ends up. Well, I think once you do it, same thing,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.000]   once you set the thing up with an and the Samsung and particular investment, right?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.160]   It is you're right. It is for power users and power users do love the thing.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.400]   They love it. Yeah. It has a place that Google has not been able to find that niche, which I feel
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.160]   like is the conclusion that we've all come to. And I hope they figure out a specific niche. It's
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.080]   not like that they don't have their fans though, and that they're not people are not buying it. But
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.920]   well, you can't see a big move in market share. It's a small group. That's the problem they have.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.320]   It's 27 million phones in eight years is not not moving the needle. I'll see. I've been a pixel
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   user for a while, simply because I want security updates first. That's the most important thing
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:44.560]   for me. But I mean, no, that's me too. And in fact, I gave my Samsung away. I had a flip,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.520]   which I really liked. At least I liked the form factor. I gave it to Stacey Higginbotham. I gave
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:57.200]   my daughter my S 22 Ultra. But because I liked the pure Android experience, but we live in a bubble.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   It's very clear. We're in a bubble. Yeah. This is it. We think everybody's
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:08.400]   I really loves a pixel six. Nobody even knows it exists. We do. You know, everybody I know has a
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.360]   pixel six. It's got a great camera and a great camera and photo software. But all,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.680]   albeit, I am pixel five. So I want the three fifty five, three point five mil Jack. So
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.000]   well, but but and it's, you know, got it's pure and right. It's got all the updates.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.320]   I guess again, the question I'm asking is Google's trying to make an ecosystem play.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.680]   Do they have a chance in hell against Samsung and Apple?
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:40.080]   Ben is, you know, yeah, where would you know? I mean, look, this is like, I have,
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.600]   this is the ultimate ecosystem. He's holding up an iPhone 14. I know I had to baby.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   They built they built an ecosystem where people want to go and build the things there first,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.080]   and then Samsung built an ecosystem where everyone like builds everything else.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   It's just you can only build for one or two things. And if you hit those two, you hit almost
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.240]   everybody and you can just do most of the work for Samsung and then, you know, a little bit of
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.360]   additional work and it goes over to Google because it is they're both I mean, honestly,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:15.120]   the zillions territory. But yeah, you you go, you think Apple first androids second becomes to
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.960]   releasing apps in general, at least in the US depends on the country.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:26.800]   You know, I am stuck. I have, of course, all this different phones and I can live in all the ecosystems.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:34.400]   But honestly, as much as I hate it and it makes me mad, the Apple ecosystem rules.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   I hate it, but the way they've set it up with continuity with the Mac, with the iPad, with the
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.840]   AirPods, with the phone with the watch, you kind of want the complete set.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   It air drop and I message magical things.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   And the people, the one person, my family, my daughter, who has an Android phone.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.400]   By the way, hates Apple, which is this again, same thing. It's kind of the anti Apple.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.880]   Same thing with Maricio Foley on our Windows weekly show.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:21.040]   Hates Apple as a Pixel 6. They honestly, I think Apple just sucks you in and you it's hard to get
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.120]   out. That's the that's the point of an ecosystem play, right? Lock it. Right. Yeah. And once you
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.320]   make a choice, I wish, I mean, the ideal world would be everything be open and interoperate and
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.640]   you could choose the best watch. You could choose the best earbuds. You could use the best phone,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.200]   the best laptop, best, and it would all work together, but it doesn't. It doesn't work that way.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.320]   And what happens with Apple, you get you, you know, and I think the phone is probably the
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.560]   gateway drug. You get the phone, then you kind of want the watch and you kind of want the AirPods
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   and you kind of it just and then you're stuck. You cannot go. You cannot leave.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:01.440]   Am I right? We're all. We're all. Hey, wait. Yeah. We're at the point where, you know,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.840]   parents are like in Dr. Dave, their kids into an ecosystem.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:16.080]   Yeah. There was a Hacker News story today about a guy who had bought an iPhone for his kid in the
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.880]   school, said you may not bring the kid was, I don't know, fifth grade, sixth grade, you may not.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.280]   By the way, most fifth graders and sixth graders in affluent areas anyway have phones now because
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.600]   it's how you keep track of your kid, right? It's how you, how you, you know, they can call for a
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:35.520]   ride or you know where they are. And the school said, no, you can't. I must have been some hippie
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:42.400]   school. No, you can't have an iPhone and they gave each kid an air tag and said here,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.960]   your parents, I keep track of you with this.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:53.920]   Yeah. And I just had to shake my head, I guess.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.400]   There was an article in the New York Times recently about how parents are putting Apple watches on
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.560]   their kids so that they can't track and do simple phone calling because you can get very cheap
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.800]   plans that way. And incidentally, Apple has a mode where you set up your phone for your kid.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.440]   He doesn't have to have a phone. She has an eye at Apple Watch and mom has the iPhone.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:23.520]   Apple knows that didn't, it wasn't there a memo. This is, this is a discovery and we're going to
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.840]   talk about discovery and the problems with court cases and discovery in a bit. But discovery can
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.120]   be a nightmare for these companies in the Epic Apple event, the court action, which Apple won
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.920]   hands down, but they lost in discovery because the email came out, I think it was from Frank
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:44.080]   Craig, Fedorighi or Eddie Q saying, we can't put messages on Android because then parents would buy
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.360]   and cheap Android phones for their kids. The Apple knows this 100%.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:56.560]   Well, yeah, but I mean, they're always going to be parents that do this because
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.760]   it gives them reassurance. I mean, back in my day, my mum gave me a watch and said,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.160]   if you're not back by 5pm, I'm going out looking for you. It will be bad for you.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.680]   Yeah, that was the 80s version of an iPhone.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.640]   As can say, this is not the world we're living in right now. And I can kind of understand that.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.600]   I can understand Apple's point because obviously they ought to shift hardware.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.080]   But I mean, these kind of child tracking things are incredibly popular. They're also, as I've
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:30.800]   learned after looking into it, incredibly insecure. I mean, if you're buying a kid tracker with Android,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.520]   you are trusting that a third party manufacturer has not just copied a software stack and isn't
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:43.360]   updating it, and you could just be leaving this wide open. So there are real problems with these
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.600]   kinds of things in terms of you might think you're making a kid safer, but maybe you're not.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:53.280]   I was in a very fancy Tiburon. You probably know it.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:03.120]   Very, very wealthy Enclave in Marin County. Lisa and I were there for lunch and there was a candy
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.000]   store and Lisa has to go to every candy store. Some people's shoe stores, jewelry stores,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.520]   she's got to go to the candies. So we go in, there's a gaggle of kids, all of them. I mean,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:19.120]   and these are little kids, maybe 8 to 12, maybe a little older than 8, 10 to 12, 13.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.520]   They're all paying with their iPhones. None of them have cash.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.080]   And there's some sort of parental control because the kids said, well, I only have $3 I can spend.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:34.480]   They all were paying with tap to pay. Now it's an affluent community, but
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.040]   that's common. Yeah, I think it's a trend. Yeah.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.280]   The wallet may barely be a thing in a decade or two. They're going to be like,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.640]   why do I have to have a physical version of my driver's license or my ID? It makes no sense.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.760]   Ed, you know what? Probably a little bit down the line. Maybe it doesn't make sense.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:59.280]   The Pixel watch looks very pretty. When you think it's a, I mean, this is, again,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.880]   I can't hardly believe it. Google's made Wear OS for years. They've let Motorola and fossil and
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.160]   everybody else make in Samsung now make Android Wear watches. They're finally making one of their
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:17.520]   own. Is it because they bought Fitbit? I think like, I think it is part of the ecosystem play.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.400]   I think, yeah, they have Fitbit. You've got to have every piece.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.240]   Yeah, you have to have every piece just to kind of be like table stakes in the game.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.760]   And I don't know, like I feel like Wear OS has kind of been like, again, not dissimilar from
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.200]   tablets, but I think a little more successful than large screen story has been like kind of a
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:40.480]   weird space for Android and Google as a company. You're an Android developer and you're wearing a
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.880]   hoop. I just don't need a smart watch. Well, I just don't need a smart watch. Yeah.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.120]   And it's actually, what may blow your mind is I actually quite a few of my Android friends have
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.080]   switched to the iOS ecosystem in recent years. Oh, wonderful world world guard. Yes. There are
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.360]   lots of Android developers. They want to be a blue bubble of green bubbles, right? They want
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:06.880]   to be, you know, they don't want to be part of that Drake song or whatever. Yeah. I mean, it's
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.760]   really interesting because I think that Google in a sense, like, especially as an Android developer,
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.520]   a lot of times it we take a lot of cues from Google first party apps for better or for worse.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.600]   And I think that, you know, for something like Wear, we kind of, and for large screens,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.160]   it's kind of hard to convince us to put time and effort into it, like, like having a Wear app,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.920]   having even a large green version of app takes additional design and development time. And so,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.120]   we often look to Google as like this kind of North star, like, hey, look, look, y'all,
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.880]   really, really serious this time, like, like, we promise you this time we're super serious about
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.720]   Wear OS and we're super serious about large screens. And so not saying that they're doing this for
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.760]   developers because I don't think so, but I think that they need to put, you know, their toe in the
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.040]   water to make, you know, Wear OS successful to kind of showcase maybe what it's about and what,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.840]   what they can do. And I don't know why that's important. Like, I keep thinking about this a lot,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.400]   especially with questions about, you know, even like the Pixel phone, like, you know, we're talking
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.480]   about whether they're ever, they're ever going to catch up and beat Samsung or Apple.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:18.880]   And to me, like, and it's weird because I think the Pixel phone itself, even itself has kind of a
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   muddled identity, right? Because, yeah, what is the 10 sort, what does the 10 sort two? What does
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.520]   that mean? Is that is it a good chip? Is it bad? We don't know, it lives in its own little vacuum.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:36.160]   Yeah, it's a very tech enthusiast world. And so, is it a reference phone? Is it like a showing off
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.760]   what Google, like, you know, learning and I can do? Yeah, I feel like they want more now.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.600]   Well, yeah, it's like they want to compete with a flagship. It's flagship, you know,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.000]   rather than folk, I mean, like they do and then they made by Google event, they had a lot of amazing
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.840]   examples of like, cross device and computation of photography and, you know, machine learning and
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.920]   like natural language and all that kind of stuff. But it's like they have all that, but they somehow
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.240]   still want to keep one foot in that, in that flagship box and create, you know, a high-end phone
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   that people want to talk about that reviewers want to review that people like us want to talk about.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.760]   And it's kind of like, I don't know how these kind of competing goals are going to play out.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.600]   I'm going to call it here. It's hopeless. The reason they're sleepwalking through these
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   events is because they know Rick Osterlo knows he was the guy who in the Pixel 4 came out
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.640]   days before the event yelled at the team saying the battery life's terrible. It's like, they know
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:39.120]   it's hopeless. And by the way, to announce a new phone and watch two weeks after you kill Stadia.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:46.880]   Oh, Stadia. A lot of people are still really, really pissed off about that. It's another reason
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.040]   people don't trust Google. They say, well, Google's just, it's a hobby.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:58.320]   I want Google Reader back, by the way, if someone's listening. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.760]   That was my favorite thing. Actually, we had a conversation on this week in Google about this,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:16.240]   because you could make the case that Google was consciously killing RSS that they didn't want an
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.000]   open standard that they, they, so what they did is they made Google Reader to dominate and then
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.200]   killed it. Like, let's put it out of its business just as they did with XMPP. They didn't want an
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.800]   open standard. They wanted a standard they controlled. And I think RCS is probably their attempt to
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:40.080]   control it. And it's going to die too, because it's, I'm just frustrated with Google. I mean,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.440]   that's moved. Many people are. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it seems to me they've moved into the rent seeking
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.080]   part of the tech cycle. They're not actually creating that much anymore. It's just a question of,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.880]   how can we bring as much money out of our various properties that we've built up over the years
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.000]   and satisfy shareholders? Yeah. I mean, how old is the couple now?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.840]   Yeah. Oh, that's 20, right? Almost 20. Over to over 20. Over 20. Over 20.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:10.800]   Yeah. So it's an old, it's an old, old line tech company. And I will submit, and we talked about
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:17.440]   this a couple of weeks ago, that honestly, if it weren't the only thing they make money on a search
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.160]   and ask her chads. And if it weren't for that, none of this would have flown. They are now
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.480]   realizing that and killing stuff like Stadia, they should, they had no reason to launch in the first
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:33.680]   place. They had no expertise in gaming. Ben, Ben Thompson says basically that they kind of knew how
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.720]   networking, you know, at cloud work. So he says, the business side of Stadia was lazy and stupid.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:47.360]   Because they didn't know gaming and they just said, we can do this.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:53.760]   But like, you know what, like, it's doable. Like, think about Microsoft and what a success story
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.040]   that's been overall into like a company that wasn't into gaming and really ingrained themselves
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.080]   and became really successful. It took a long time. They lost a lot of money on Xbox for years
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.240]   and years and years. Yes. And it takes that. Yeah. Well, I think commitment and a low luck.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:16.880]   Maybe and luck and timing. And you're right because I think when it was bomber, I don't know if he
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:26.080]   even knew what Xbox was or had a strategic vision. But clearly because because Stadia Nadella comes
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:33.600]   from, he ran Azure, comes from cloud. He saw, oh, you know, this could really be an entree into
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:41.920]   cloud, cloud gaming. And I think I think the long term prospects for Microsoft gaming
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.440]   are very good, especially now that they're acquiring Activision. They bought Minecraft.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.880]   That was a brilliant move, right? Brilliant. Brilliant move. For sure.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:58.560]   They have shown since bomber left a really good strategic vision. That's just one example
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:06.160]   in a bunch of areas. Just complete aside, probably top five CEO in the country.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   And Sundar Pichai bottom five. Is that controversial to say?
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.680]   It's always controversial to make a bottom five.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.280]   I mean, there's so many that could be. Where does anyone go on there?
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:25.040]   I know. And you got plenty of people on there. But honestly, Sundar is not doing a good job with
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.200]   Google. Maybe it's not as hard. I want to put them on a par with Paul O'Loughton, Paul O'Loughton.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.240]   It's a big deal. You know, good way. Good guy to when it comes to making money,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.360]   no vision whatsoever. A cure to plan for the future. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:46.000]   And in that business, you cannot coast. You cannot sleepwalk because you'll get your lunch
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.960]   eaten. There's there's sharks out there. Best not to walk around asleep.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:57.440]   The, well, the interesting thing about search, and you probably seen it recently,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.920]   maybe you've talked about it is Gen Z is doing. I know they used to talk.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.440]   Talk. I tried it. I like tried to like actually this kind of works for certain kinds of things.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.800]   You're doing travel stuff. It actually is really quite useful. I understand.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.800]   It's a little weird. We'll talk about that in a little bit. For us, for us, all these.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.960]   But not for them. There's a lot, there's a lot going on there. There's a lot to say about that.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.560]   I just want to point out that Google freaked out because everybody thought the future of search was
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:35.760]   the Facebook social graph. Remember that? And so Google created Google plus. Another fine Google
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:43.520]   product. Actually, to be honest, like most other Google products, it was really good, but they
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.000]   couldn't, they killed it. I had three quarters of a million followers on that.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.240]   I missed them. It was great. I loved it. So Google's flaw is not that they make bad products
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.440]   because I think the Pixel 6 is a great product. Pixel 7 is going to be a great product.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.960]   But they can't follow through. There's something wrong. Well, and there's there was one
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.400]   contention that the problem is the mismatched incentives at Google. And this you could blame
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.080]   Sundar Pichai for, which is you get promotions at Google for coming up with a new product.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.760]   You don't get any support for supporting that product. Google, and that's why Google
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:23.600]   invents a lot of stuff. And it all flops in the long run, like Stadia, because they don't
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.520]   incent people to be on the team of the long-term product. They incent people to invent the next thing.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.200]   And that's a big problem with a lot of tech companies. And I've been at large tech companies
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.560]   where that is exactly the case, where say, for example, you have a team and their job is to make
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.480]   features that end up on the front page of Gizmodo. And then the rest of us who have to do the hard
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.880]   work of keeping a service or a software scalable, maintainable, and all these very unsexy words
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.800]   don't get as much recognition. So yeah, the incentives are way off because when you move fast
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:06.240]   and break things, someone got to fix it. And so I totally agree. And it's kind of messed up
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.560]   as someone who works on this side of it. And presumably it also kind of results in kind of
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.000]   mixed business results in the world. Is it a bad management? When or is it, I mean,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.520]   I don't know, I think sometimes like, I think a lot of times it is structural. And again,
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.720]   I am just an engineer. So this is like the perspective from which I'm doing.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:35.760]   Don't say just an engineer. That's the way it feels at times. And I think that,
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.560]   you know, a lot of times they think that especially in tech, a lot of people are chasing. And I think
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.040]   that's exactly what it is. What is it that will get the verge and what is it that will get wired
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.320]   and Gizmodo and will cause like a tweet to go viral. And I think because of like the history of the
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:57.280]   way that tech has exploded, that's still a, you know, a bar of success. And so I think a lot of
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.880]   companies tend to chase that quite a bit. And it kind of seeps into like, you know, OKRs and like,
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.720]   like goals and strategies. And then it kind of trickles down to the fact where, you know,
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.040]   like certain things that are not sexy, but that are really important for people to, you know,
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.840]   to kind of for customers and for for users to be both happy and, you know, safe and secure in your
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   service in your software, you know, don't get as much attention. And I do agree that that that
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.960]   causes eventual issues in terms of incentives. I mean, certainly I do. And then like speaking
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.080]   for certain people, like there are a lot of people on the Android team just want to shout out that
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.160]   are very good at this kind of thing. But I think when you have a big company, and I've been in a
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.200]   couple companies that aren't just a product, but a family of products, where things like
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.680]   cross selling and like, you know, how do we integrate like this product in this product? Like that,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.080]   like Ron Richards on on triple triple. I always says like the left hand doesn't know what the
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.560]   right hand is doing. And that that generally seems to be the case a lot. And so all of that kind of
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.640]   gets mixed up. And I feel like there's some lack of follow through because of all these like
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   different things going on and these like mismatched incentives. So yeah, a big tech. Yay.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.680]   Yeah, it may. I mean, honestly, as an engineer, I'm sure you know this. It's much more fun to
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.440]   create a new product than to maintain legacy code. And I'm sure that there are all sorts of
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:20.400]   incentives. But that ultimately comes down to the leadership, countering that notion and saying,
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.920]   no, no, no, it's really important that we make sure that our legacy products are well maintained
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:31.600]   and work and perform because that's where we make our money. And you know, I know maybe you don't
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   want to do this when but you got to maintain your product. That's leadership. That's that's
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.040]   called good business. That's called running the company properly. And so ultimately comes down
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:48.800]   on the synergize shoulders and the executive team. I think, yeah, engineers are always going to
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.120]   want to invent. That's I mean, I that's why I'm not a code monkey because I don't want to maintain
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.520]   legacy code. I don't want to look at anybody's code base. I want to do my stuff.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.480]   That's why so many people want to start companies. You see it all in the news and then
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.120]   you see $20 million raising, you're like, oh, it's going to be sunshine. It roses.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:16.480]   What is it always? Yeah. So what's so octane, you're at the stage now. You're past that stage now.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.720]   You're kind of in the past the growth. You're kind of in the maintenance. Keep it going.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:30.400]   Is it harder? It is easier to grow product. Like it is much easier to go like it's much
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.520]   harder to go from zero to one million in an annual recurring revenue than it is from one and above.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.800]   It just it's just more fun. It depends on a whole bunch of things.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:47.440]   I it depends on your personality. I really like the early part of building. I also like,
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.560]   you know, building teams. So there's something fun at each stage. But you know, then that's why
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.480]   Sergey and Larry go off and run their blimp projects and you bring in adults
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.120]   because it's time to run the company, right? Not to invent the company.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   It's a very different skill sets. Different skill sets. And very few people are great at both.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.040]   Maybe that's part of the problem. You got a lot of founders.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.560]   I think a lot of the problems with Google have been because they've hired far too many
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   managers and not enough innovators. Do you think it started with Eric Schmidt?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:24.400]   No, I mean Schmidt was needed because otherwise Google wouldn't have been the success it was
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   without Larry Larry called it adult supervision. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that works out. Yeah.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.520]   No, it worked out perfectly. Yeah. Well, not perfectly, but it worked out very well. But
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.400]   Google stopped creating. You know, I mean, where where are the big announced? I mean,
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.200]   do you remember when Gmail first launched? It was a bombshell on the email front. They launched it
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.680]   on April the 1st, which is a journalist. We really resented because it was like, is this an April
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   or not? Is this another toilet internet or what? Yeah. But I mean, that Android whole, you know,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:02.640]   the photos, the whole thing used to create things. And right now, with the particularly with the,
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.040]   you know, the made by Google, there's just like, hi, here's something which everyone else has
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:13.360]   been doing for a while and some minor software tweaks. Yeah, yes. You know, I wasn't actually
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.640]   at the event, but I understand they did, they've copied Apple's practice of having cheerleaders
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.000]   in the back of the room who, you know, will woo every single event. And it's just like,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.120]   once you've done that, you've lost your central tech argument.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:34.160]   By the way, Larry Page's Kitty Hawk, which was his electric air taxi startup is folding.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:41.760]   They announced that Wednesday. Yeah, just one more. We're nail in the coffin. Hey, I have to take a
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.240]   break. I am having so much fun. I don't want to stop the conversation. But we have lots more to
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:54.800]   talk about, including the existential question did Louf tons of ban air tags and why that's all.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:00.720]   That's all coming up. Ben Park, great to get you back. So nice to see you. I want to hear all about
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:08.400]   your new podcast, business envy, business envy show.com and octane. AI. It's really fun to have
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   you here. Good to see you again. Of course, Ian Thompson, always a pleasure from the register.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.720]   Dot com now. I don't have to say dot co dot UK, although I bet that still works, right?
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.120]   Oh, yes. You know, I thought of you in the queen past, I thought, because I remember you
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:27.520]   really liked the old lady and I think I'm a hard one. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm a Republican with a
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:34.240]   smaller, but I think choosing your head of state, the army and the church by both lotteries or a
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:43.680]   stupid idea. But on the other hand, but yet she did a lousy job really very well indeed. No one
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.960]   should ever have to do that job, but she put a time I was I was actually kind of depressed for a
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   couple of days. I thought you might be I was thinking believe it and I was thinking of you
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:59.120]   and thinking, you know, I should also do. Did you see the footage of the queue because that was the
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:08.400]   most British in our line? Oh, 13. I mean, David Beckham got a 13 hours. That's awesome. Well,
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.120]   all the VIPs just, oh, yeah, I'll turn up to a quick walk past and the rest of it. Yeah. No,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.120]   I mean, it kind of did show. I mean, it showed who we were as a people. She's always been there.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.200]   And while I think her idiot son is going to make a lousy king, we shall see.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:32.240]   I, you know, I predict that Charles will somehow magically take the glow and become the king.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:39.440]   And it's it's you know what? I realized, yeah, it's a terrible idea. But at the same time,
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:45.760]   it's really nice to have a head of state who's not political, who's just there to kind of reassure
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.040]   people. And she was very good at that. And Charles, if he's kind of starting to look a little bit
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:58.800]   like a prick, but if he can find a way to become the nation's heart in the way that
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:06.640]   QE2 just, I mean, yeah, it was it was it was very tricky because in he's been holding on for this
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:14.080]   job for over 60 years. And he does have ideas about ruling the country as opposed to being,
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.000]   you know, a constitutional monarch, which is his job. Really?
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.080]   Yes, aspirations of having power. Well, I mean, he's been sending letters to ministers.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.720]   The last couple of decades about what he wants done. I mean, we forget that the Royal
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.040]   Family can actually veto legislation if it affects them personally. And considering he owned
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:40.000]   Cornwall or owned Cornwall. You know, that was a fairly wide remit. But some, I don't know,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.040]   his first address was very well done. I liked it. We'll see if he grows into the role.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.600]   As I say, the very idea of a birth monarchy is just a lot.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:57.920]   No, but as I said, I think there's a emotional value to having a non-political leader that you
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:04.000]   can kind of project upon if for one of a better word, your concerns and your fears.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.080]   I think that's a good thing. I actually, I'm sorry, I just interject, but I heard a really
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.120]   brilliant YouTuber named Philosophy Tube, who is British once basically said that the Queen is
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:20.080]   the UK's waifu in the UK. And I thought that was the most waifu. Sorry, how do I go into
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:26.480]   why I explain what I understand totally. I can explain that aspirational kind of
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.800]   an admiring aspirational kind of relationship where you kind of have a special relationship.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.160]   Yeah, but yes, the UK's waifu philosophy tube, not my idea, but I thought there was a very
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.800]   distinct way of kind of describing that emotional connection. It's like your pillow bride.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:48.960]   So wouldn't want to disrespect the Queen by saying such, but yeah.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.800]   No, I really know. I think no, you're exactly right. It's and that's why I said project.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:02.160]   It's somebody who is almost a blank slate, really, that you on to which you project your hopes and
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.680]   fears. And it helps emotionally helps you. And you know, we don't have that in the United States.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.120]   All we've got is horrible presidents. And it'd be nice to have somebody who was just apolitical
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.800]   that we could just, you know, kind of, well, I mean, the US has its own monarchy at this stage.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.960]   I mean, I remember the wrong time. You know, it's not. I thought you were going to say the
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:28.320]   Kardashians. Oh, that's a card that Kim Kardashian is a waifu. You're right.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.440]   They are. They are. Unfort better. Where's our waifu is? Oh, dear. That's cool. Yeah.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.960]   There's the title. Exessential crisis. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. It's great to have
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.520]   went to Dao. She's my waifu. And it's so good to have her lead developer. No, I'm kidding.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.120]   Lead developer at Adobe coast of all about Android. First time on the show thrilled to have you.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.520]   Thank you for being here. It'll be here. I want to take a little break. I hate to do it.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:59.600]   Because we're having so much fun. But I want to talk to you about Wealthfront. And now is a good
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.120]   time to mention, I think, Wealthfront. Wealthfront's goal is to make building long-term wealth,
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.960]   long-term underscore wealth easy, offering both high-yield savings and automated investing
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.840]   accounts to do just that beautiful interface. You'll love the app. Give the banks keeping money
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:22.560]   that could be yours. If you're earning less than Wealthfront's 2.55% APY. Yeah, find out what
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.120]   your savings account's getting. It ain't that I guarantee you. Federal interest rates, of course,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.760]   they're going up this year and they're going to continue going up. That means banks have been
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:38.800]   earning more on your savings. Have their interest rates been going up new? According to the FDIC,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:46.640]   the average US bank has only raised their rates to 0.17% this year. Do you hear that?
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:51.440]   Wealthfront's now offering their clients a rate that's about 15 times higher. And that's just the

[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:53.360]   So, Lufthansa sort of denying this, sort of not denying this. Lufthansa bans air tags and luggage.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:59.920]   And of course, why? Because passengers have been publicly shaming Lufthansa
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.800]   with a location of their lost bags. It is better if you do not know what your bag is.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:12.640]   Lufthansa says, "Well, we don't ban them, but you do have to take the battery out of them before
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.560]   you put them in your bag." And they work so well with that battery.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:27.040]   You know this why this rings really false. I spent a year as the editor of an aviation IT
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:34.720]   magazine. Oh, so you know. I took the pilot's about when that first mobile phone ban came in,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:40.400]   I was talking to a pilot about it. He goes, "No, we know when someone's got their mobile phone on
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.640]   in the aircraft because it's usually one of us. You know, you can hear it. It doesn't interfere
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:50.400]   that badly. This whole Lufthansa thing strikes me very much off. We don't want the PR problem
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:56.640]   rather than as an actual genuine physical danger here." Here's an example of Lufthansa tweet from
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:02.560]   Keep On Discovering on Twitter. "I just traveled from Athens to Charles de Gaulle business class
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:08.720]   at a two and a half hour transit in Munich somehow." He's talking to Lufthansa. "You've lost my bag
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.920]   in between. Apparently your team can't find it, but Apple's ear tag says it's in Toulouse."
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:22.800]   I've been doing this for years, but with the tile tags to track all of my luggage.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.680]   And it's incredible. And it's incredible when you lose something, you're even just trying to
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:33.760]   like track when it's going to go and get come in. And so I had to like do a disclosure years ago,
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.680]   I sat on the innovation advisory board of Lufthansa. So this is fascinating for me. I have no context
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:46.160]   or anything. So I will straight up say, I am surprised that they're taking this stance. It's
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:51.520]   definitely from probably a more conservative group of Lufthansa. It is not the stance that I
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:57.360]   would take by any way to perform. The wrong way to go about this, I would agree. You're not going
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:03.280]   to see it in the US. I can't imagine they would do that in the US. It's such a... So it is a battery
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:09.440]   and I guess they don't let you put your laptop anymore in checked luggage, right? But it's a tiny
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:16.240]   little thing. I don't think it's for concern. Honestly, we cover thermal runaways a lot and
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:22.640]   I've never heard of a coin size battery going full. I think it just doesn't happen. They're
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:30.960]   engineered that way. But also, I mean, my wife tried the air tag in the luggage thing on our last
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.440]   trip and it was actually quite stress inducing because we were sitting on the plane and she's like,
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:40.080]   this is still showing up as a being in the terminal. Where is my luggage? Where is my luggage right
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.840]   now? And then when we landed, of course, it was all all right because it was just a delay from the
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.920]   actual signal getting through. Yeah, you don't want to pay too much attention to it. But, you know,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:53.520]   but no, I mean, Lufthansa's position is ridiculous. Yeah. In service. Yeah. It's kind of... I have to say
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.720]   everything now Apple has does this. So as I leave home, it says, my phone says, you just left your
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.400]   laptop behind. I know I just want to bring it to work. It's a little... It can be annoying and I
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.440]   have the same problem with bags. You know, you... I keep an air tag in my bag and I will on Lufthansa.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:18.000]   Good luck finding it, Lufthansa. But when you then get to the hotel and you go for a walk,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.680]   your phone says, hey, you just left your bag behind. It's like, I'm sure there's a way to fix that.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.120]   I don't know. It's a little annoying. I'm just saying. But...
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.160]   Also, if you've got travel insurance, losing your luggage is not the worst thing in the world.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.080]   Because if they lose... I think I don't know how it is over here, but in the UK,
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.320]   it's more than 72 hours than the airline will pay for new clothes shopping.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.280]   Really? Quids it? Oh, yeah. I lost my bags for over three days.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.440]   How much did they give you? How much did they give you?
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   A thousand bucks. Really? Oh. Decent amount. I thought they were like...
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.920]   I got six hundred... I got six hundred... Like 50 bucks or something.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.200]   I got 600 out of Virgin America, but no, it's...
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.160]   It's my head. It's international trip. It depends where you lose it. If you're going somewhere
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.400]   and you lose it, that's bad. If you're coming home, you got some extra underwear at home. You're
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.320]   probably okay. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. And you pity that poor devil actually opens the bag
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.120]   and finds your own love pair. I'm gonna just buy one $1,000 pair of underwear. That's what I'm gonna do.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.800]   You can probably do that in California. All right. Two words that strike. It is Halloween coming up.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.680]   It's spooky month. I guess that's what the Gen Z calls them.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:40.320]   So two words to strike terror into anyone's heart. Elon Musk. Are you scared?
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:48.480]   I've entertained. It is entertaining. You got to say that. I know there are people who listen to
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.840]   a show who's a... I've already pressed the stop button. I don't blame you, but we got to cover this.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.840]   This is a story. It's a huge story. I promise we'll make it entertaining everyone. Stick around.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:07.280]   Elon's doing his best. Yeah. Do you... I first of all, I was asking this question earlier.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.760]   Are Elon's tweets weirder on the weekend? Like maybe he's...
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.000]   You know, have a... It's more bored. High slash drunk slash something. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.520]   Because I'll show you his most recent tweet coming soon from the boring company,
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:32.960]   new fragrance called burnt hair from Singed. So what is he smoking? I mean, seriously.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.800]   We already know what he's smoking at this point. Oh, actually, we've seen him do it. We've seen him do it.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.040]   He did say that this week that he finds it fun and amusing and relaxing to tweet.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.920]   But some of these tweets, for instance, his peace plan for Russia.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:58.240]   And China as well. Did you see that one? Yeah. No, what was it?
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:04.560]   Chinese government official formally congratulated him saying, "Actually, yes, a split-sates solution is
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.320]   blood of a plan for Taiwan." And he was just like, "When he planned for Taiwan, great." Yeah.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.760]   He mixes it in with these amazing shots of the SpaceX Dragon,
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.120]   docking with the space station, doing stuff that NASA seems to struggle with.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:31.280]   It's a very weird admixture of billionaire cockiness, extra-curricular drug use, and genius.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.960]   Well, you see, the Germans have... Sorry. There you go. I want to hear what the Germans have.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.280]   I was going to say, the Germans have...
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.400]   They probably have a word for them. They probably have a word for it.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.720]   They do have a word for it. It's called "fashidiad".
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:52.960]   It means someone who is incredibly smart in one or two areas and an absolute idiot in others.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.600]   He's a fashidiad. That's exactly right. Yeah.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.480]   And I... Have you seen that? Yeah. I mean, also, after what he said about Ukraine,
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.680]   there's another German word, which is, I think, "Besharshaft", which is a face made for smacking.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.120]   I think the Ukrainians would really fail, feel that way.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:16.720]   Honestly, if your peace plan gets the vote of the Russian government and the Chinese government,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.680]   you're probably on the wrong track. I'm just saying. I'm just saying.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.520]   Unless you're trying to curry favor from the Chinese government.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.680]   And then that's the... Yeah.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.720]   The deeper question... We always ask this question about Donald Trump is like, "What is his motive?"
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.160]   And honestly, sometimes I do think Elon's playing 12D chess.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.760]   It just... He's doing it drunk or something. He's doing it on Molly.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:46.080]   So this week, he wrote a letter saying, "Okay, okay, fine. I'll buy Twitter."
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.880]   "Thereby putting the trial off for a month. Also,
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.240]   maybe more importantly, putting off his deposition, which was scheduled for Thursday
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.000]   for another month. Also, ending discovery." And then we were talking about discovery earlier.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.040]   Discovery, these trials, you might win, you might lose, but they're almost always bad for
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.640]   the participants because stuff comes out that's embarrassing.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.400]   The text messages.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.480]   Oh, I know. I know.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.720]   Okay. Just a couple of things I have to say here. One, Elon's mindset, and you can see it through
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:31.280]   the text, is he is never wrong. And it's not because everyone is fawning over him.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.080]   Right.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:32.960]   And no one's really...
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.160]   There's so many ask-
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   There's so many ask-
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.160]   ...kissers in his... What did Jason Calligan say?
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.280]   And you and I are both buds with Jason. I love Jason.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.720]   But I'm embarrassed for him.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.800]   I wasn't going to bring it up, but my gosh.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.320]   I was going to bring it up.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.640]   Faced in the mouth cringe. I mean, no.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.320]   So just like, don't say it. Don't say it.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.680]   Oh, no, you went there.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.040]   What did he say? I can carry your sword boss or something like that.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:57.440]   Oh.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.360]   He volunteered to be the CEO of Twitter, Pester D. Elan over and over again.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.000]   I remember, Ben, you probably got this email. I got the email.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.480]   Elon said, "We're going to get together a consortium of investors to help Elon buy Twitter.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.640]   And would you like to put some money in?" And Elon eventually had to say,
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.000]   and it's in these messages, "Would you not get off? This is embarrassing."
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.440]   Elon actually did not look like a doe-
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.720]   doe-face in these messages. It was all the people messaging him that looked like doe-
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.680]   ...pps, I guess.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.600]   But what's Elon, I think, was afraid of,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.520]   and I think that there's also a case to be made here.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.920]   There is evidence that Elon was talking before the whistleblower
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.760]   was talking with Peter's Zacko Mudge.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.440]   There is a message where he said, "Let's go to a more secure platform."
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.960]   There apparently some evidence they moved to signal, and those messages have now been deleted.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:58.240]   But there might be a problem there with Elon talking to Mudge before he blew the whistle,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.960]   you think, that Elon doesn't want that to get out.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.440]   Essentially, in her ruling, the judge did say that there were significant concerns about the
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.400]   signal messages or rather the gap in the message strings.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.040]   Missing messages.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.240]   Which was supposedly attributed to signal.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.400]   So, yeah, that could get really ugly.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.960]   That might even be criminal, I don't know.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   But there's more than just-
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.040]   This is America, execs don't get prosecuted for being criminal for good things.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.440]   Is he going to mind a fine?
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.880]   I mean, look, this is the point of why people use signal is for this exact use case.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.280]   And no, Elon's not going to get punished for that.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.880]   But Elon is going to get quote-unquote punished by, he's going to eventually buy Twitter one way or
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.280]   the other.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.320]   That's just how it's-
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.640]   So that's the question for the panel.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.720]   Is he sincere and is he going to actually complete the deal?
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.640]   Or I mean, that's really the question.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.000]   You think he is, Ben?
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.960]   He has no choice.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.360]   He might be trying to make moves to delay things or to not do deposition or to try to add to-
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.960]   People are saying maybe he thought he was going to lose and so he wanted to preempt the trial like that, I think.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:04.960]   Right.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.440]   Don't get it.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.080]   He is historically bad at depositions.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.360]   Because you cannot lie in a deposition and he's historically bad at them.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.640]   And he doesn't want to go through that and none of us really want to go through that.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:18.960]   No, I wouldn't.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.520]   That is not a fun-
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.560]   Yeah, especially on Molly.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.120]   So-
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   whichever drug of your choice, you want to have your deposition in that is up to you.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:26.960]   Oh, love you, man.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:32.080]   And then you can keep on saying that in the jail cell.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.680]   But for Elon, you know, like he's stuck.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.880]   You know, he's stuck.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.280]   He's gonna-
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.000]   He's gonna have to buy it.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.080]   He's gonna have to buy it.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.840]   Like, I'm sure he's trying to figure out every single way to like, weasel out.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:49.200]   But I think the truth is that he's gonna buy it and then he's gonna have that chip on the shoulder
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.400]   to try to prove everyone wrong.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.000]   Like, I can actually make this like worth more money and I can implement what I'm saying.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.360]   You know, it won't break all of Twitter.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.800]   And I-
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.600]   He buys it, which he says he will, $54.20 a share.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   It's way overvalued, right?
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.880]   It's he's paying-
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.720]   He's like buying a car for 50% over the asking price.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.200]   It's nuts.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   It's like Microsoft trying to buy Yahoo for what?
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.040]   It's $48 billion.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.120]   They breathed the entire belief when that fell through, I could tell you.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:17.920]   Oh, I still bought it.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.320]   We're naming it.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.120]   Talk on that.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.360]   And he was just like, that was the biggest lucky break of my career.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:23.760]   Oh, man.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.080]   Was getting turned down by Jerry Yang.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.760]   And he was just like, seriously, we dodged such a blur on that point.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.720]   But isn't that interesting?
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.080]   I mean, that's maybe what happened to Elon.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:32.960]   He thought it was a good idea.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.760]   And then a day later, he went, oh, what was I thinking?
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.440]   This is a terrible idea.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.080]   Tried to get out of it almost immediately.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.320]   But he could have kept the due diligence portions in that deal.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.440]   And he didn't.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.680]   And that's part of what's screwing him over because if it had the due diligence portions,
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.960]   he would have been able to get out after due diligence pieces.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.840]   And he rushed it is like what he did because it it felt probably felt like he had to rush it.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:05.360]   And like I get why he wants to own, you know, essential source of media, but it is an overvalued.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.800]   It is an overvalued piece, but be like, there's no way out.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.280]   And Twitter's not going to let him get out of it.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.240]   The shareholders are not going to let him get out of it.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:14.880]   I don't know.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.360]   I cannot think of a way he gets out of it.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.880]   I'd be curious to see, but I'm starting to already move on to like what does Twitter look like
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.320]   after you owns it.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.520]   Do you call it "musker"?
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.480]   Do you send musk?
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.760]   You press Elon's head when you send a musk.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.320]   Well, that would have to be cool about this.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.240]   It's talking about this ex app.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.800]   And as an Android developer, I'm curious what you think on this one because all this
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.960]   ex app stuff looks like a coping strategy for, oh my God, I can't believe what I said.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.800]   Here's Elon's problem right now.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.080]   Here's Elon's problem right now.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.640]   He not only is he going to have to spend $44 billion, but the banks who have lent him money,
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.920]   Larry Ellison, the Saudi Sovereign Fund, I would guess they're not compelled, right?
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.760]   Ben, they're not compelled to go through with it or maybe they are.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.840]   They're looking at huge losses.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.640]   He has to convince the investor because if he doesn't get money from them,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   he's selling a lot of Tesla stock.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.520]   That's going to be a big business problem going down the road.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.440]   So he has to convince investors.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.440]   He has the genius plan.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.600]   That's why he tweeted, "Twitter is, what does he say, just accelerant for the everything app,
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.440]   X, the everything app."
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.240]   So that's a great question for when, why isn't there an everything app?
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.400]   He's liking it to WeChat in China.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.800]   Why don't we have a WeChat in the US and could you make one?
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.200]   No, this is insane.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.960]   So I think part of it is...
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.080]   No, it's too easy.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:50.480]   No, no.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.240]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.800]   So I think that it's totally missing a lot of things.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.240]   So just like a lot of other things, like kind of something succeeding depends on a lot of different
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.560]   things.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.800]   Timing, luck, just like a lot of different things.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   And so I think, I'm not really an expert.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:15.680]   So as far as I can tell, just to engineer, is that WeChat, I think, grew organically as a chat
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:15.840]   app.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.240]   And just like, they'll kind of reflect him back on the whole RCS problem messages,
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.400]   iMessages, whatever, is that chat is such an interesting kind of function and app
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.720]   category within our mobile space.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.600]   It kind of makes sense that WeChat is what it is because of this kind of organic nature,
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.720]   especially with chat apps being very country, like heavily country-based, like outside of the US.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.400]   There, like a lot of chat networks are by country.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.600]   So you have like a cow talk in Korea, WeChat in China, line in Japan.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.560]   And so especially given what I understand of Chinese design and everything, it kind of makes
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.840]   sense that they started with WeChat, which was this kind of like great platform for communicating
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.520]   with everyone over apps, kind of building on top of that.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.600]   And so in our country, we have it different.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.320]   We have this whole like plethora of chat apps and as well, not to mention the other things that
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.880]   X is supposed to do, like freaking finance transactions and purchasing.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:21.760]   That function has already been taken up by various things like Venbo, Google Pay,
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.120]   Cash, whatever you have.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.760]   And to, you know, kind of like one of the problems facing app developers in the year of our smartphone
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:35.440]   2022 is the fact that you already have so much competition, so much like embedded,
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:43.600]   you know, user bases that trying to come up with the new thing just to plant whatever exists is a
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.240]   is a hard, you know, challenge in any individual industry and any individual segment, any individual
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.840]   like vertical, whatever you want to call it.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:59.200]   So the idea that Elon Musk is going to take Twitter, which is a social media network or social network,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:06.160]   of, you know, it's owned very wide swath of problems, political, sociological, security,
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.320]   everything else, and then build, you know, the big app on top of it and get not just Twitter users
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.480]   to use all these things, but try to bring average people that don't like Twitter or that aren't,
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.120]   that aren't kind of like doom scrolling every day to bring this on is, is just kind of fighting
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.480]   against that kind of internal entropy that people tend to have with the things that they like.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.360]   It's like the idea problem.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.520]   Once you have something that works, it takes a lot for people to move on from that.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.960]   And so that is like, so you kind of a lot of the problem that people are navigating the same
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.240]   app space. So I don't see him replacing everything with X app.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.720]   You don't think Americans are looking for the one app to rule them all?
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.120]   I don't, I personally don't think so.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.920]   We're completely happy to have 20 apps that we use.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.480]   We use Venmo and we use.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.960]   Yeah. It's easy to switch between and they're better individual than a part.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.000]   Yeah. Like who am trying like, but it's not forget that chat succeeded in China at a time
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.600]   when the Great Firewall of China blocked Facebook and Twitter and a whole lot of social services.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:12.160]   So there wasn't that choice in China. There was really a lot of support for Tencent from the
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.280]   Chinese government to do this. They got sweetheart deals with the trains. And so
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.960]   you're not in communist China with the Great Firewall of China blocking you from all these
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.680]   Western apps. You're just not in that environment.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:36.480]   It's a different environment, but like really to understand like the X piece because this is a
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.800]   dream that Elon has had for 20 years. It was the name of his first company was X.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.840]   It was the name of his first company. It merged with Peter Thiel's company, what was it called?
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.960]   Confinity and it turned, yeah, Confinity and it turned it to PayPal.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.720]   You know, he was successful as a software founder with PayPal, of course.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:04.640]   I have make a prediction. I would not be shocked if Elon put Twitter and X.com together
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.800]   and turn it into some combination of Twitter plus like a financial app and use Twitter as a basis
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.160]   for that. Added some crypto go to it. Will it succeed? I don't think so. I think that's
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.000]   extraordinarily difficult, but I think he's wanted to do something like this actually
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.920]   for a very long time, at least the X.com thing. He wanted another shot at it.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:30.000]   Now he could use Twitter to go and like make another shot at it. I can see that being what's
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.120]   in his head right now. He's, by the way, lost control of the X.com domain, but bought it back.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:44.640]   He has it. But owning a web domain is meaningless in this day and age, right? If it doesn't succeed
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.200]   on mobile, it's not going to succeed. If you can't put the pieces together, then you know,
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.480]   and if you can't deliver the app and why is Twitter a good place to start? I don't even think Twitter
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.480]   is the right place. You would much prefer to have WhatsApp than Twitter, right? Or Facebook Messenger,
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.440]   even Apple messages. And by the way, Facebook would love to do the everything app. So would Apple,
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.360]   neither one has tried or succeeded? They both have payments. They both have parts of it.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:16.880]   Just about the six of this as well, ridiculous. I mean, it's hard enough to build one good financial
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   app. It's hard enough to build one secure chat app. It's hard enough to do one thing. And you know,
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.960]   we've already talked about millions of examples, say for Google example, where even just individual
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:31.360]   products and kind of brand and vision coherence is just, is apparently very hard, unsurprisingly.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:38.880]   So it's just the technical and like logistics of doing all of this in one app and trying to
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.360]   supplant every other app is just insane. I go as an engineer, but no, no, no.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.440]   Well, and he wants to get another challenge, which is already since his bid for Twitter,
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.400]   700 people have left. I don't know when if you know anybody works at Twitter, but I would bet that
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.600]   a lot of current employees are thinking, yeah, let me just polish up that old resume.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.400]   This is what I signed up for type thing, particularly if the share price jumps on the buy on the buy
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:08.080]   app. Because they can then cash out the ship. Isn't that oh, I see then they catch out the day.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:14.320]   They can cash out their chairs, their shares value. And one of the things from the tweets came
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.280]   through was that, you know, several people were saying, once you take over, you can do a really
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.120]   good color of headcount because other people that don't like you are going to leave. And that
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.680]   gives you an instant production, a headcount and sort of fixed costs. But honestly, I just don't
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:35.440]   see it. I really don't, which is a declining social network platform anyway. Important with
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.080]   the older girl, but not with the younger. Turning this into some kind of, you know,
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.760]   ex platform, which does everything. It's fantasy land.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.440]   Twitter went up more than 10 bucks.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.560]   When he said I'm going to buy it, currently $49.18.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:58.800]   The difference differential between 49.18 and 54.20, that $5 differential is exactly how much or
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:03.600]   little the stock market believes, right? If the stock market really believed it was going to happen,
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.800]   the stock price would be 54.18. Yeah.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.200]   So that's problem.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.520]   I don't see how he's going to wriggle out of it. That's the thing.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.000]   I think he is going to put it.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.640]   But there's still no, he's going to have five bucks worth of uncertainty.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.920]   He's going to buy it. And then he's going to have different stories the next day. The very next day,
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.840]   the first story is going to be, I have returned to the greatest platform of
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:32.640]   Trump said, by the way, even if Elon invites me back, I've got truth social. I don't need Twitter
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.800]   anymore. No, he'll be back. Yeah, why wouldn't he? He'll be back. Yeah, period.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:44.160]   But I have to say, I would bet that there be, I don't know, 5 million people would leave the
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:50.480]   minute that happened, right? At an in protest. Here's Chris Anderson, the guy who does Ted Talks.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:57.120]   Amidst all the sneering I'd like to offer a prediction for how the Elon Musk acquisition
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.640]   of Twitter will play out. First of all, I think the deal will indeed go through now,
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.560]   backed by an impressive roster of co-investors. Oh, get ready for some.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:12.240]   Next, the company will undoubtedly experience a period of significant turmoil.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.040]   Yes, there's a lot of change ahead. Many won't like it, but it will gradually become clear
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:23.120]   that a lot of the changes are actually quite exciting. First of all, fears of all content
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.960]   moderation being abandoned will prove unfathomable. I agree with Chris on that. You can't.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:33.200]   It just be make a cesspool. It becomes 4chan if you don't keep content moderation going.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.680]   Instead, he says the algorithm will be adjusted to avoid giving so much amplification
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.840]   to political divisiveness. Is that the problem on Twitter? He says,
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.960]   the debate that matters is not about who is on or off the platform, but what type of tweets
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.280]   get amplified. If that can change, everything changes. You know what's interesting? And this,
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:01.120]   we saw this in the messages to Elon to everybody who's anybody in tech has an idea of what Twitter
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:06.240]   needs to survive. What Twitter, what you could do with Twitter, and this is Chris Anderson's idea.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.840]   Next steps will be put into place to verify all human Twitter accounts.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:15.040]   That process will lay the basis for those accounts to be used for transactions.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.440]   Allah, we chat using a Twitter crypto coin. Oh boy, or USD.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:27.360]   There will be crypto. There will be crypto. You're right. There will be crypto. For example,
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:33.680]   people may be or offered paid subscriptions and receive usable tokens. This could bring the company
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:38.640]   significant revenue plus create its own economy on which goods and services can be transacted.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:44.080]   The sheer scale of Twitter can rapidly bring this to critical mass. About a year from now,
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.080]   growing numbers of people will be attracted to Twitter slash X. It will be far less prone
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:55.920]   to robust spam and algorithmic fueled outrage. Instead, it will offer lots of new functionality.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.560]   There's plenty Elon could be legitimately criticized for his own use of Twitter,
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.400]   can seem ill advised. He can give the impression of being more political than he is.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.920]   And there's no question there will be many bumps along the way, but this is the key point.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.400]   As a tech entrepreneur, he is without peer in 2013.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:22.000]   Oh, I love it. Oh, giggling. Oh shit. Sorry. In 2013, Chris Anderson goes on.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.880]   I predicted he could become the world's richest man within a decade check.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.520]   The next decade will be even more spectacular. Fixing Twitter may be as hard.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:35.040]   A job is converting Teslas into robo taxis and proving the viability of a monster rocket
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.360]   capable of taking humanity of Mars. But within three years from today, I predict
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:46.320]   Elon will have accomplished all three to which Elon says, yeah, you're right.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.960]   Elon was very happy with this tweet. Would you like a set of knee pads with that?
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.680]   Good Lord. Nice.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.520]   Oh, my goodness. Quite a prediction, huh? We'll be on Mars.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.120]   Twitter will be the wechat of the US of the Western.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.640]   I wrote a story a while back where Musk was saying we will be on,
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.800]   we will have our first Dragon capsule on Mars, I think in 2019.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.360]   It's a Musk deadline. You know, I mean, it was out three years.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:18.560]   Well, at least I want actual dragons. I want to ride an actual dragon instead.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.760]   It's probably both just like faster. Yeah.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.120]   Fly over to fly over to the bar.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:31.680]   Before we take the break, house of the dragon or the rings of power votes.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.560]   I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it because British Bake Off is on.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.200]   Oh, British Bake Off. That's a write in.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.240]   Okay. My girlfriend and I, you met my girlfriend.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.320]   I did. She's a she's an amazing player.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.840]   You're fair and I say yes.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:55.440]   We her and I are just over on the house, not House of Dragon, the Lord rings of power.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.400]   Yeah. I think one more episode it winds up Friday.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.720]   It's just so beautiful.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   Yes. It really is pretty. New Zealand.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.840]   You have to watch out on a giant screen with a popcorn.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.760]   And yeah, she'll just be like.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.880]   There's far less child birth and.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:18.240]   I mean, House of Dragon, I do think has like intrigue,
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.200]   but it's it's still a lesser game of thrones and I think both have their places.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.400]   I just think that that beauty of the Lord of the Rings is due to television.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.600]   And like while the story may not be completely new, it's just gorgeous.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.040]   I can forgive so many things because it's just the most beautifully shot show I've ever seen.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.280]   When?
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.560]   GBBO. Sorry. GBBO.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.760]   GBBO.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.280]   Yay. Excellent.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.880]   Yeah. Great British Bake Off.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   So that's the winner in this weird poll.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.280]   I just.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.200]   With the writing.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.560]   The writing.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   The writing.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.440]   You can't be a Hollywood handshake.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.680]   You know, it's just the way it is.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.480]   You know, I.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.520]   I have to get in the.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:59.680]   I have to say, I apologize in advance for American viewers because they did Mexican week this week.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.800]   Oh, you don't.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.800]   And so you've seen someone peel an avocado with a potato peel.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.520]   Oh, Lord.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.560]   America just going.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.920]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.320]   I saw the tweets.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.120]   I saw the tweets.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.320]   The British do not have to peel avocados apparently.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.360]   We don't know how to do Mexican when I first came over here having eaten Mexican only in London.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.440]   Then you come over here and you taste it. So that's what it's supposed to taste like.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.320]   This is brilliant.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.360]   On the next episode of Business Envy, Ben and Greg started Mexican restaurant.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.720]   There is actually a story in the independent Bake Off contestant,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.440]   horrified viewers with avocado peeling method during controversial Mexican week episode.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:49.200]   Honestly, I was flashing back to last year where one of the cooking challenges was to make brownies.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.680]   So many of my American friends just like, I'm cooking brownies right now.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.840]   These people have no idea how to do this.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.320]   That's a poor thing to watch.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.720]   I can't watch this.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.800]   She's basically crazy.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.680]   I'm so sorry.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.560]   I apologize in advance for those that haven't seen it.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.400]   For those that have my sympathies.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.920]   That was more difficult than anything I've had to watch all week.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.400]   I actually, at first I was a big fan of House of the Dragon.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.840]   There was a little bit too much horrible childbirth.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:29.280]   Then the Rings of Power was too complicated for me at first.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.000]   But I have to say by episode six, the Rings of Power starts to take off.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.880]   Episode seven last Friday.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.280]   Wow.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.760]   I think Rings of Power easily is going to win this one.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.720]   So it's a time.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.640]   It's a time like the Sumerillion or...
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.080]   Yeah, it's kind of fish.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.040]   Simerillion-ish.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.280]   There's interesting actually legal issues because they didn't buy the Sumerillion
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:51.520]   rights.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.160]   Right to specific notes from the appendix of the return of the king.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:58.800]   I think.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.400]   So there's certain things they can't reference.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.960]   They can't reference Hobbits, but they talk about, you know...
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.200]   Oh, is that why they never say Hobbits?
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.240]   There was Harfoots.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.360]   Harfoots.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.000]   Harfoots.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.880]   And then the time frame is...
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.320]   Sorry?
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.080]   No, I was just going to say, then the byline that this is an adaptation of the appendix of
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:16.800]   the foreboding.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:23.520]   This is the stuff that Tolkien did because he was really able to get all the background stuff.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.760]   I have a billion dollars for it, right?
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.960]   A quarter of a billion dollars.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.240]   Made a huge amount of money and didn't get the rights to the Hobbits.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.400]   For crying out, wow, Jeff, get that together.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.120]   Anyway, you're right.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:35.680]   You got football?
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.480]   It is...
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.680]   They're definitely...
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.560]   It is beautiful.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.360]   I agree with you Ben.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.920]   And I'm really kind of digging the storyline.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.680]   So it got...
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.520]   You know, it took a while for me.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.640]   It took five episodes to really kind of gel.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.880]   And now it's really on fire and all cylinders.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.240]   We're going to need a tie...
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.000]   A tiebreaker for the British.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:54.400]   We need it.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.640]   It's a tie between the Great British Bake Off
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.680]   and the Patlerings of Power.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.080]   I don't know.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.320]   Wow.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.840]   John, you want to throw the tiebreaker?
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.600]   Hasn't seen it all.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.840]   You know, you got an opinion dog in this hunt?
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.760]   He likes some posts.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.640]   You guys suck.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.120]   Everyone listening has to break the tie somehow.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.440]   Oh, good grief.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.000]   Yes, it's...
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   I mean, to each their own.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:24.320]   It's...
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.280]   You have some very good TV shows over here.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.800]   We have some very good ones over there.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.040]   But...
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.680]   Hey, thank you for Jesse Armstrong, though.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.960]   I want to thank you for him.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.520]   Ah, well, you know, we work along.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.640]   We've got the actors.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.640]   Michael Kay and I still think his national treasure
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:38.960]   of the Stasis.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.360]   Love him.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.240]   Love him.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.360]   Jesse Armstrong, who created so many great shows,
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.280]   is the creator of Succession,
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.320]   which is easily the best show on television.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.680]   That is a lot of fun.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.560]   That's gonna be said.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.040]   I agree.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.040]   He did In The Loop, which I thought was amazing.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:02.240]   And that was based on the thick of it, right?
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.960]   Yeah, the thick of it is well worth watching
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.240]   four lions, by the way.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.960]   I'm amazed if it actually gets shown over here,
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.320]   because it's kind of subversive,
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.080]   but I do recommend that.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.040]   But in the thick of it,
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.920]   it is amazing.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.960]   Just be aware the language is...
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.920]   That's what's great about it.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.400]   It's salty.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.680]   It's salty.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.680]   It's Scottish epitents.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.760]   It's what it's great about it.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.440]   And it was the inspiration for Veep.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.800]   Yes.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.920]   So, which was another one of the greatest shows on American.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.480]   So many great US shows are just inspired by the Brits.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:35.280]   You think about...
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:35.840]   The Office.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.160]   Dragon's Den.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.440]   No, that's Canadian.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.400]   You think about like,
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.520]   Who's Line is it anyway?
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:42.400]   You think about...
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.640]   ...How's the cards?
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.520]   Now, how's the cards?
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:46.480]   Yep.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.960]   Although, I do find this is one of the kind of annoying things
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.480]   British immigrant is that you took House of Cards,
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.840]   and you took The Office,
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.560]   both of which in their original were two series,
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.520]   and that was it.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.080]   You wrapped the whole thing up in two series.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.080]   The Office carried on after the main characters.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.000]   We Americans know how to bring money out of everything.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:08.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.360]   No, no, no.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.560]   I understand totally,
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.320]   but it's just incredibly frustrating.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.600]   Because, you know, the storylines get stretched so far.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.840]   It even happened to Queer as Folk over here.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.880]   It was just like,
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.440]   what do you put...
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.400]   You know, it's like,
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.040]   is money more important than creativity?
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.320]   Oh, hang on, I'm in America.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:24.960]   Right, America.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.760]   Right, America.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   Well, it's not even a question in America.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:33.200]   Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology.
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.240]   We love these guys.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.760]   They're at the forefront of innovation,
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.320]   working with clients all over the world
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.160]   to bring technology to business,
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.760]   to transform business.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.640]   But one thing I always love about WWT,
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.080]   they know business.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.320]   At the heart of WWT,
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.840]   is this notion that your business strategy
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.320]   and your execution go hand in hand,
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.840]   and they're very aware of that.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.480]   So they work as a to support you
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.120]   in achieving your business goals
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.800]   by using great technology.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   And it all starts with their ATC,
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.120]   their Advanced Technology Center.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.800]   When the magazines got rid of their testing labs,
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.040]   I remember the great Ziff Davis testing labs,
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.120]   World Wide Tech took over.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.480]   They built this amazing thing.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.920]   It started about 10 years ago.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.080]   It's a research and testing lab
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.720]   with half a billion dollars in equipment.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.560]   From the leading OEMs,
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.480]   all the enterprise technologies.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.240]   I remember going to visit in St. Louis,
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.160]   right before COVID, we went out,
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.360]   rack after rack,
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.960]   building after building of some of the most amazing technology.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.680]   Why?
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.680]   Because, well, their engineers use it
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.040]   to build proofs of concept,
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.800]   to pilot new programs,
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.840]   to design something for your business.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.280]   But now what's really cool,
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.600]   they offer to you access to this lab.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.360]   Hundreds of on-demand and scheduleable labs,
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.920]   featuring solutions that include technologies,
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.680]   representing all the stuff you want to know about,
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.200]   the newest advances in cloud and security and networking.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.520]   Primary and secondary storage,
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.000]   data analytics and AI,
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.240]   DevOps and on and on and on.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.640]   So you can now get in there,
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.080]   test out products and solutions,
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.600]   before you go to market.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.560]   Yeah, the engineers and partners use it all the time.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.880]   But you can also use it.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.480]   Not only the labs we can access,
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.920]   technical articles,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.560]   expert insights, demonstration videos,
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.840]   white papers,
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.360]   other tools to help you stay up to date
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.320]   with the latest technology.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.680]   Get ready for this.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.160]   It's free.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.640]   You don't even have to go to St. Louis.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.080]   It's a physical lab space,
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.760]   but you can, it's virtualized.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.600]   You can visit it anywhere in the world,
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.320]   anytime of the day or night, 365 days a year.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.640]   All you have to do is join the ATC platform.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.600]   And by the way, while you're exploring the platform,
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.040]   when we were out there, we did an event,
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.520]   they do great events at WWT.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.960]   And they have wonderful communities,
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.400]   places to talk about, to learn about technology trends,
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.440]   to hear the latest research and insights from experts.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.960]   It's a resource you've got to take advantage of.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.800]   Whatever your business needs,
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.520]   WWT, worldwide technology,
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.120]   can deliver scalable,
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.840]   tried and tested tailored solutions.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:16.240]   Because WWT brings strategy and execution together

[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.680]   Again, free.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.120]   All you have to do is go to www.wt.com,
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.720]   slash twit, create that free account on the ATC platform.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.720]   It's such a great way to learn.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.640]   www.t.com/twit.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.360]   We thank them so much for their support of the show
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.400]   and of the network.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.480]   We are big fans of WWT.
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.520]   All right, that's it for the Elon segment.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.800]   And I think you guys,
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.920]   you made it much more interesting than Elon had any,
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.680]   any rate to be.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.640]   Meta and a caller on the--
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.560]   Death spiral, yes.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.960]   That's an interesting question.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.400]   I mean, their stock has gone down so low now
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.000]   that they are not in fact,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.640]   have to worry about EU regulations anymore,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.800]   because their market cap is so low.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.720]   Well, yeah, but they're shedding staff left, right, and center,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.880]   because people are realizing they're sharing.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.520]   Yeah, their share options are going to be worth nothing
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.080]   in when investing time comes,
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.840]   and they still have to pay tax on them.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.240]   So they're losing a lot of key staff at the moment.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:36.720]   But I'm not going to buy that Facebook--
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.160]   and I won't say Met, I'll say Facebook,
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.280]   because that's what we're really talking about.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.200]   I'm not going to buy the Facebook's going to go away
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.760]   until there is a replacement for it, right?
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.960]   Even people who hate Facebook,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.160]   which is almost everybody,
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.480]   that's the one place--
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.960]   But there sort of is,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.440]   it's just over time, and it's called TikTok.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.800]   And look, let's be clear.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.400]   Like, Met is not going any time soon.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.560]   Instagram is still widely popular.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.680]   What's happened still widely popular?
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.400]   Oh, but they're doing the best they can to ruin Instagram.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.120]   You have to agree.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:11.360]   They're trying the best they can to compete with TikTok.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.320]   To turn it into TikTok.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.600]   But turning it into TikTok isn't what the users want.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.000]   No!
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.760]   It's all the rebellion from the Kardashians.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.320]   Even the freaking Kardashians.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.560]   So, I mean, they're actively ruining one of their best properties.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:25.760]   They don't--
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.840]   It's kind of stunning.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.480]   Well, I think I'm not sure about ruining their flailing about.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.160]   We've always seen this thing with social networks
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.640]   going right the way back to Friendster and before.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.520]   You get this sort of--
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.320]   You shut up take, and then there's a long tail,
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.480]   and then the next generation goes,
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.120]   "That's boring.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.440]   That's the stuff like the older generation uses.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.960]   Let's try something new."
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.920]   And in the past, Facebook was able to buy up Instagram
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.160]   and various competitive products.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.680]   But it can't do that anymore.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.040]   And yeah, I agree with Bern.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040]   I think TikTok is the next thing,
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.000]   and TikTok will be taken over by something else eventually.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.760]   It's the ecosystem,
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.280]   the competitive ecosystem,
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.120]   these products have to work in.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.560]   Let's ask a young person.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:09.520]   Win?
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.800]   Oh, I'm not that young.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.080]   Oh, come on.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.520]   You're young with us.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.080]   Oh, that's all.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.200]   I'm turning 40 in January.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.360]   Oh, you're gonna turn 40 in January.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:19.840]   Well, okay.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.880]   I'm the young end.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.600]   You have--
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   Yeah, it turns out Ben's the kid.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.640]   So you have a few more months of youngness.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.400]   Oh, you cute me.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.440]   You know.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.120]   Yo, I went clubbing for--
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.400]   I went clubbing for you.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.640]   We're going all the time now.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.400]   Oh my goodness.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.040]   But you're very active on Instagram,
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.320]   as we talked about earlier.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.520]   And thank you post videos.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.200]   But I mean, when I started Instagram
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.400]   and the day it started,
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   it was a great place for me to post photos.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.920]   I really liked that idea
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.920]   of sharing photos with friends, family,
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.640]   and eventually my larger social network.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.240]   It's not that so much anymore.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.760]   Do you still feel like Instagram
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.360]   fulfills you?
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:07.440]   I think, but I think they're going to change my opinion of it pretty soon.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.920]   Like, I keep yin and I just kind of like yin said,
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:10.960]   like they're flailing.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.040]   The kind of introduction of Reels was pretty
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.080]   hamfisted and a little bit confusing.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.760]   They're adding more ads to make my--
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.560]   like they explore tab and like the feeds even more confusing.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.000]   They're putting more ads in, isn't that amazing?
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.200]   They're putting more ads.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.040]   And also in places that you--
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.320]   Actually, to be perfectly frank,
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.640]   I am actually a sucker for Instagram ads.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.120]   I'm a very good Instagram customer.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.160]   Oh, God, yes.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.280]   It's they're too good.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:37.680]   Yes.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.480]   They're too good.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.560]   Especially when you're going through stories
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.760]   and I'm just like, oh, what is that?
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.400]   That's really awesome.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.840]   Or through your home feed.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:44.800]   That's amazing.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.160]   But I think they're starting to push it.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.080]   I think that the ads within the profile feed,
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.640]   which is when you click through to an individual,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.280]   you know, users' feed and not the grid.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.880]   But when you actually are kind of like having a feed
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.840]   of individual users,
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.680]   throwing ads in there is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.560]   That's kind of a little bit experienced breaking to me
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.520]   and a little bit confusing.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.800]   You never want to confuse users.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.120]   And I sure as hell been confused as F quite recently.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.080]   And then also I think--
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:10.720]   I don't know this like--
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.560]   Is that the Instagram stories where they're adding the--
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.520]   what is the loop?
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.520]   We end the loop or the loop.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.680]   They're adding some kind of functionality
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.120]   to add looping ads.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:19.840]   The end of--
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.320]   They're called--
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.200]   Post-loop ads.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.320]   Post-loop ads.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.120]   Four to 10 second skippable.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:25.920]   OK.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.080]   Ads and standalone video ads would play after you watch your reel.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.040]   Just, you know.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:33.600]   And when they--
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.200]   I don't know why they do that.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:35.680]   I know why they do that.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.760]   But for users, they do that.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.400]   Because most people don't watch your reel only once.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.880]   You watch it again and again, just like on TikTok.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.240]   You watch again and again.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.520]   So they figure if we put--
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.880]   Because normally a post-roll ad is like throw away.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.080]   Because people have seen the video.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.440]   Why are they going to watch the ad?
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.680]   But because on reels, you watch it again and again.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.360]   So the ideas are going to stick these four to 10 second ads
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.280]   in between before you can watch it again.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.000]   That means to me that maybe people might abandon.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.920]   And if you're a creator, this might not be a good thing, right?
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.240]   And there's just, you know, with TikTok,
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.360]   you have like a better alternative as a creator
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.240]   to going viral really quickly to an audience
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.360]   you don't have access to.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.480]   And that really matters.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.240]   And I'm, you know, with the octane side of my life.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.000]   We work with a lot of people, a lot of brands that do TikTok ads.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.280]   And they're really sophisticated.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.640]   Do they work as well as Instagram ads?
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.920]   If you do it right, they can work incredibly well
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.200]   for incredibly cheap.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.040]   Because there's still lots of time for arbitrage.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.120]   Because it's still not figured out by a lot of people.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.520]   But if you could like really be able to storytelling for a man--
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.320]   Always good to get on the next platform before it gets big.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.440]   Because--
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.160]   Before it gets expensive.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.280]   Yeah, very expensive, yeah.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:57.200]   So, I mean, yes, Instagram ads work,
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.440]   but they work because they're part of the scroll and the feed
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.360]   and they like another post.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   And they're very clever because they don't put ad
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.880]   until the bottom of the post.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.280]   So before you know it, you're looking at it
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.000]   as if it's a post from your friends or family.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.160]   And I don't know.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.840]   They're also much better than--
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.160]   Well, I haven't used Facebook, but in a long time.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.840]   But I think they're much better than Facebook ads
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.800]   and targeting you, right?
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:21.280]   When--
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.520]   Because they seem to know exactly what I want to buy it for
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.080]   in the morning.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080]   Oh, it is creepy.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.360]   It is really creepy.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.280]   It's creepy how well Instagram knows me.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.480]   But I think that it's a limit because they're in places
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.560]   where they're kind of acceptable, right?
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.560]   Where there's like a feed where, as you said,
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.840]   like I might think, oh, is this like a post
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.360]   from this other creator that I'm like,
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.280]   I'm like, oh, no, this is very adjacent content.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.000]   It makes sense.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.800]   I get sucked in.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.080]   Oh, shoot, I'm following this person now
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.840]   and then buying their things in the Instagram shop.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.640]   That's fantastic.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.520]   Or it's in stories where kind of by nature of it,
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.960]   you're kind of flipping through things
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.280]   and waiting for something to catch your attention.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.680]   And that's actually, I think, a very decent spot for the ads
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.280]   because especially if they're done well,
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.520]   they really do catch attention and they feel not
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.280]   obtrusive because of their scalability.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.000]   I don't know why.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.800]   I mean, I understand why that they're trying to offload
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.040]   some of the lost revenue from Facebook onto Instagram.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.320]   But I just feel like it's kind of like a lot of different things,
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.840]   I think, especially again, with large companies
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.120]   with a lot of products,
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.040]   in order to kind of counterbalance products
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]   that aren't going well, they try to leverage the products
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.560]   that are still doing half well.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.880]   And instead of really leveraging it well,
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.480]   there's more just putting an anchor on it
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.400]   and letting it slowly sink to the bottom slowly but surely.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.480]   So yeah, I don't see myself.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.920]   I mean, as much as I love Instagram
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.880]   and I've personally, without getting too fluffy about it,
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.040]   I've gotten a lot of benefit out of Instagram,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.960]   like creators, like fitness, makeup,
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.080]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.840]   And of course, again, wildly susceptible to Instagram ads.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.240]   I don't think this is the way to go to offset.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.280]   And I think that trying to catch up
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.760]   and trying to play follow along with TikTok
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.080]   and whatever social network comes up is a losing proposition.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.480]   It's just kind of there on the Titanic
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.840]   and they're just kind of like out a little bucket
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.200]   and they're just kind of like kind of,
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.880]   what's the word for when you like bail out?
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.720]   They're just like bailing out the Titanic
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.160]   with about three dozen people on their little Instagram ads.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.880]   Like, okay, firstly, come on, come on.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:17.760]   Come on, come on, visual.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.080]   - Yeah, but now it's great.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.320]   - The water's going higher and higher.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.080]   - Fails, like, look, look, look, that's what the look's for.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:26.880]   - What?
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.960]   - The boat is so, let's go to the metaverse.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.880]   Well, there you go.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.760]   - So, let me see.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.560]   - Where the boat is above water.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.560]   - It sounds like you pay attention to this space
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.640]   pretty closely as part of your business.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.720]   So, if you were advising somebody to buy ads these days,
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.200]   are you telling them TikTok?
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.800]   - I am definitely, like, you have to diversify.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:55.920]   So, last year, Apple released iOS 14.5 and iOS 15.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.880]   It made it possible for people to opt out of data tracking.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.240]   That is probably the single most consequential decision
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:06.400]   to all of online advertising in the history of ever.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.760]   And any business that is heavily reliant on online advertising,
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.480]   this is e-commerce brands, this is basically everyone.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.440]   It really, really affected them.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.840]   Like conversion rates dropped by 40% while the raw prices skyrocketed.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.040]   And so, now it's a whole different era of strategy.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.560]   You have to experiment with new things.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.440]   And we've seen that the companies that are experimenting with TikTok ads
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.080]   and using that to bring new people traffic are doing really well.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.840]   But it's not this exact same.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.600]   You can't use the same stuff you used in Instagram
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.800]   and bring it to TikTok.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.760]   TikTok is just a different kind of storytelling.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.840]   And you have to warm them up a little bit more to buy than say Instagram.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.160]   I feel like in Instagram, they are more ready to buy,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.640]   just by the nature of the thing.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.560]   In TikTok, they're less ready to buy,
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.720]   but you can really get them there.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.560]   You just have to really follow the format.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.440]   Like, I've seen people develop these like super detailed sheets
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.120]   on how to do TikTok ads.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:03.680]   And they follow those, the letter and those work.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.880]   It's a crazy Wild West, in other words, for everything right now.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.840]   This is why you're seeing just huge stock drops with meta,
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.040]   huge stock drops with Snapchat and everything else.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.720]   And you're seeing like some social networks
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.760]   that have to be the beneficiary of even that turmoil.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.080]   And a TikTok is a beneficiary of that turmoil,
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.280]   because that's where audience is.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.440]   I vote we stop calling them social networks.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.200]   I think one of the things that's happening
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.040]   is the old idea of, oh, it's a network of your friends,
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.640]   your family, it's a social network, is giving way to,
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.760]   we're just watching TV.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.680]   They're creator networks.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.120]   YouTube proof this, right?
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.160]   People aren't going to YouTube to keep up with friends and family.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.600]   They're there to watch content.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.240]   People go to TikTok to watch content.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:50.800]   So meta, which Instagram used to be a social network,
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.080]   Facebook did too.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.320]   Both are moving more towards that creator space,
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:59.920]   where it's content you watch and you get engaged with.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.640]   Isn't that what's going on really?
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.680]   Is it socials dying?
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.240]   All right.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.120]   You disagree Ian?
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.200]   Well, I mean, I think a lot of social companies
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.760]   are flailing around trying to find something that works.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.440]   YouTube is killing off a large amount of its user base
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.920]   by overdoing the adverts, just as Instagram is.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.560]   TikTok is currently a descendant,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.280]   but they're worried about what's coming next.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.600]   I don't honestly think social will die,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.120]   because people love it too much.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120]   People want social, but they're not getting it where they are.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.240]   So how do they go to get it?
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:39.920]   I mean, I see people on Discord and family,
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:41.760]   and Prouts family uses Slack.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.040]   That's become their social.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:43.520]   No ads.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.720]   Nobody else.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.360]   Private apps.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.000]   Private apps.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.440]   Oh, my message.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.880]   What's app?
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:50.480]   That's my, that's a core,
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.920]   I have a lot of my social networks now.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:53.200]   Yeah, why not?
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.240]   And then you don't get ads.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.200]   You don't get strangers.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.760]   You don't get messages from the president.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.640]   You just get your family friends, right?
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.160]   You get those too.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.880]   My god, Biden's just so pushy at times.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.880]   Hey, it's an election season in the US.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.280]   The next four weeks are going to be a nightmare.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.320]   Oh, don't get me.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.240]   Seriously, it's one thing that could improve my YouTube experience.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.480]   I cannot vote in the US button,
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.200]   and I stopped getting all these adverts about proposition this,
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:22.160]   and proposition that.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.120]   Is there a button?
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.320]   Sorry, we need a button like that.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:24.960]   There is a button.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.480]   There was called YouTube.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.680]   It's called YouTube Premium.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.800]   Pay 12 bucks a month.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.440]   Oh, there you go.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:32.400]   I pay for it.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.880]   I haven't seen it added three years.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:35.920]   Oh, that's all I'll say.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.400]   Absolutely.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.640]   And then you go to someone's house who doesn't have YouTube premium.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.160]   I was like, what's with all the ads, man?
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.880]   Just like, you're so right.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.480]   It's actually funny because just two days ago,
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.720]   signal added stories to their beta.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.360]   So what is that all about?
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.480]   What are they?
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.040]   What is that?
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.000]   I was doing show prep,
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.920]   and my husband and I were eating lunch,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.480]   and I look over and I'm like, dude, do you have stories
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.680]   at the bottom of your signal?
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.560]   Because he's in the beta.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.200]   And it's--
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.600]   I mean, to your point, though, I think that's--
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.120]   I mean, it's kind of silly, right?
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.280]   The idea that, oh my gosh, not everybody's doing stories,
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.800]   because Twitter added it with their--
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.360]   I forgot what they called their version of stories, of course.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.120]   So it's kind of interesting, though,
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.760]   that maybe that is kind of a sense of where it's going,
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:18.560]   because maybe, like, because our social networks
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.200]   have become so much more, for better, for worse,
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.680]   probably for worse, that people want that connection
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.840]   with their friends and family, that kind of old,
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.000]   like, intimate, like, you know, sharing stuff,
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.520]   like that Facebook used to be,
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   that all these other networks used to be,
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.120]   and maybe, like, the private chat apps
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.720]   were going to pick it up, because, yeah, now I'm like,
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.720]   oh, well, I can share all my ridiculous, like,
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.640]   workout videos with my family now on signals.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.160]   See, that's why signals are doing that?
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:40.560]   I feel like--
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.760]   I don't honestly know.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.720]   It's bizarre.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.680]   It's, yeah.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.160]   It's a weird move.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.400]   Yeah, it's a really weird flexible signal,
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.480]   because they were all about--
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.880]   under Moxie, they were all about, you know,
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.280]   let's keep it pure, let's keep it simple,
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.880]   and now Moxie's gone.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:57.520]   Maybe that's just--
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.480]   I know, but when I--
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.120]   I like the team that's got in after him.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.680]   I just don't quite know what they're doing this one.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:08.640]   I'm not going to be posting a signal story,
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.080]   probably, anytime soon.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.160]   Probably I'm going to post what tonight, let's be honest.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.520]   Do people do that, do group messaging?
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.000]   I always think if signal is one-to-one private messaging,
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.400]   but I guess you could do a family signal,
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.280]   I guess you could--
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.880]   Is your husband going like--
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.280]   Yeah, we do.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.880]   Crypto groups.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.680]   Crypto.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.200]   That too?
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.320]   Yeah, crypto.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.000]   But yeah, we have a family-- we have a couple
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.040]   of different family signal groups,
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.640]   because in the-- oh no, Google Hangouts is going away drama.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.440]   We kind of-- all of the tech savvy among us were kind of,
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:42.160]   like, I guess, auditioning different chat alternatives,
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.000]   and I think Weg flat came up and anything like that.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.240]   But I think, finally, everyone unsettled on signal.
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:49.040]   So I actually don't mind, because I think it's interesting
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.880]   that a lot of my family--
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:54.480]   and I don't know what that says about my particular bubble,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.480]   or, like, demographic or whatever,
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.280]   but that a lot of my family just completely avoid,
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.120]   probably for the best, Twitter, and Instagram,
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.480]   and all the social media.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.520]   But we have signals.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.120]   So I don't know.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.880]   I might actually post a workout--
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.560]   workout story to signal and see if my fam appreciates it.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.600]   I don't know.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.600]   It could just then-- no one will ever say anything.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.280]   I'll just embarrassingly stop.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.600]   I wish I could get my family and friends
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.920]   to use any single platform.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.360]   But I just can't.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.360]   You know, I mean, it's all Apple messages or Android messages.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.560]   I mean, it's so nice.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.560]   My family do do WhatsApp groups,
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.480]   and I refuse to use WhatsApp.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.160]   I've tried to get them on signal, but, you know, what can you do?
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.360]   I don't even use Telegram.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.240]   I don't care.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.440]   I just want-- if we can all--
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.800]   Oh, fish, yeah.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.920]   Can't we all just--
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.680]   Well, I'll tell it, Graham's all right.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.760]   I mean, we're all just going to message our truth social.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.680]   Are you on truth social--
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.600]   Or that new dating app that the--
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.120]   Oh, that was--
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.080]   That advert was hilarious.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.160]   Is there an in-cell dating app?
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.160]   Yeah, what is it called, everyone?
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.200]   That's like a social--
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.040]   Is it the right stuff, I think?
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.320]   The right stuff, yeah.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.120]   Oh, they want--
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.120]   Yeah, the advert is just hilarious.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.600]   It's kind of like, wow, this looks like a lot of really
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.840]   uncomfortable first dates, you know what I mean?
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.520]   Oh, I get it.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.160]   And the question's--
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.360]   Right is in right wing.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.080]   And the question's they ask you on signing up.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:20.480]   It's like--
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.840]   Crazy like January 6th is--
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.680]   I want a man who behaves like an alpha male.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.320]   Here, I'm the one--
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.040]   I'm going to play--
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.000]   That's not a treat a woman.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.040]   I don't know if this is--
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:27.920]   Oh, this is--
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:28.320]   Yeah, this is what--
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.360]   Should I play this?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.080]   Dude.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.680]   It's painful, but go for it.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.920]   This is their promotional ad.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.480]   Make sure my volume is--
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.680]   This is what they want.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.240]   This is--
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:38.640]   Oh.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.240]   This is the promotional ad for--
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.440]   Play right into their hands.
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.440]   I'm giving them a little extra.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.120]   Don't take it down.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.240]   We're not making fun of you.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.040]   Oh, why is she not talking?
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.080]   But you know--
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.040]   Oh, there she is.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.480]   Let's start over again.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:52.800]   Here we go.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:53.440]   Hey, guys.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.000]   I'm Ryan.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:54.480]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.040]   First of all--
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:55.520]   I've got a ton--
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.720]   Hey, guys.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:57.200]   Really?
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.000]   OK.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:58.720]   Hi, Ryan.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:58.720]   Ryan--
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.240]   Well, let's not explain to me.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.480]   The sex imbalance in this app is going to make Ashley Madison
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:04.960]   look good.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.280]   By the way, I just want to point out--
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.480]   This is a carefully chosen.
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:09.840]   She's wearing a cross.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:10.800]   That's very important.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.520]   So it's--
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.400]   Oh, you about something.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.760]   I am so excited for you now.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.640]   Is she famous?
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.200]   Ryan--
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.840]   Is she related to the other machanini?
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.920]   In her--
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.800]   She's a digital marketing and brand communication strategist.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.960]   Former Gators TF athlete.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.240]   I don't know anything about the--
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.400]   Ecclesiastes 3.11.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:32.800]   So there--
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.320]   All of us conservatives.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.760]   It's called the right stuff.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.840]   And it's launching this September.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.800]   What I love most about it is that it's invite only.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.400]   So not just anyone can join.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.200]   None of your lived, tired friends can join, OK?
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:48.560]   They make that very clear.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:48.960]   Is it?
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.000]   And they still get in.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.120]   But you're not.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.480]   Not if you're not a--
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:54.960]   And for my ladies, you'll never have to pay
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.120]   because we all get premium subscriptions.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.200]   We're simply inviting a couple friends.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.720]   Gentlemen, if you want access to premium, that's on you.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.160]   And by the way, only--
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.120]   My gosh.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:09.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, the right stuff is all about getting
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.880]   into the right-stating pool.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:11.920]   Oh, I think it was.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.600]   The human parents aim values and beliefs as you.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:16.560]   You'll start off by building your perfect profile.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.000]   No pronouns necessary.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.480]   We want you to put your best foot forward,
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:22.960]   which includes your favorite photos of yourself
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:24.800]   doing what you love or being with the people you love.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.400]   Oh, there she's posing with the presence of the--
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:27.280]   Our love is all about the opportunity.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.080]   On the golf course.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.920]   Let people know various sides of you.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.640]   So remember, be authentic and creative.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:36.240]   We're sorry that you've had to endure years of bad dates
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.520]   and wasted time with people that don't see the world our way.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.800]   With libtods.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.280]   OK, once you're in the app, you have the ability
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.160]   to scroll through profiles of people in your area.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.680]   But you can also adjust the settings to see anyone anywhere.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.120]   Once you've liked a couple people, you're ready to post a date.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.720]   You can either keep your option open.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.000]   Well, this makes sense, right?
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.360]   I mean, it's like any other affinity group.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.280]   You want to hang with the people.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.640]   I mean, this--
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:03.600]   I mean--
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.240]   The differences that the FBI has been using
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:11.520]   get to find January 6 interactions.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.160]   No.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:13.920]   Oh, there was reviews even--
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:14.960]   Review with someone.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:15.440]   And I don't--
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.160]   Could be lies.
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.040]   But there's been rumors.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.560]   Yeah, that the FBI has been--
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.280]   Oh, boy.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:19.920]   Found some people.
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.400]   In directories.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:21.360]   Because there is literally a question.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.680]   Finally, there's an app for us.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.960]   Are you a proud boy?
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.800]   Well, I'm a proud girl.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:29.760]   And let's get together.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.320]   Wow.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.640]   All right, I don't want to play any more of this.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.800]   But there you go.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.880]   Ladies, if you like to be commoditized--
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:39.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.120]   What does this thing call again?
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:44.360]   If you wear plus-sized khakis and have a neck beard,
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:47.720]   we've got a gal for you.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.960]   Wow.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.520]   It's actually-- that's Kaylee McEnany's sister.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.680]   So there you go.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:54.280]   She has her--
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:55.000]   Well, you know--
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:55.680]   She's got three--
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.680]   She's got three--
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.520]   It's another grifter on the--
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.320]   I'm sure they got paid very well for doing it.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.200]   And no one will use it.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:02.520]   It's a little die after a year.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.160]   So, you know.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.600]   That's it.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.000]   And I was going to say, oddly, no one
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]   has done an antifa dating for Apple.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.720]   Yeah, we need an antifa dating date.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:15.280]   Antifa dating.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:19.040]   I mean, E-harmony, as I understand it,
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.480]   is now mainly a Christian dating site.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.440]   I can't complain.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.640]   I've met my wife on their dating site.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:25.520]   You're happily married.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.080]   We don't--
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:26.880]   You and I don't--
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.280]   You can get it.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.040]   --know I've never used any of these--
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.280]   Hinge or Tinder or Grindr.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.800]   Thank God I didn't have to.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.360]   I married somebody before.
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.360]   I had to use that kind of thing.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.520]   Did you-- Ben, did you ever use a dating app?
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.520]   Deborah and I met through a dating app.
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.640]   It was called The League, which was also invite only
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.480]   for Better for Worse.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.080]   But we met there.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:52.680]   And--
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.960]   What made you a league person?
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.240]   I have no idea what their criteria is.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:00.280]   And no one really does.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.360]   That's kind of the point.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.800]   Like, you don't know what the criteria is.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:05.280]   It's probably like, oh, they did some things.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.640]   Oh, they look interesting.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.920]   The one thing that is nice about those kind of an app,
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:13.440]   like The League, is if you start sending negative things
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.040]   about people--
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.040]   OK, I'm sorry.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.440]   But we're going to have to mock you on this.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.000]   You just--
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:19.640]   Oh, my, yes.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:20.400]   --your sandwich and--
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:21.640]   Oh, my.
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.560]   Is he skateboarding in a tuxedo?
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:25.800]   I often skateboarding in tuxedo
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.840]   because I like skateboarding a whole lot.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.120]   It's a skateboard if it is.
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.560]   That's hysterical.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.520]   This is hysterical.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.680]   I will say this, but one positive thing is--
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.680]   You might-- you're viewed it by the way.
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:40.800]   You-- your girlfriend or fiance--
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:41.960]   I think she's your fiance.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:44.760]   Maybe I'm should speaking out of school.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.680]   But is very talented, smart, a playwright,
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.960]   really cool person.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:52.480]   So--
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:52.960]   I think so.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:54.800]   So it worked for you.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:58.520]   I'm not going to knock this.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:01.240]   At least I didn't meet her on the right stuff.
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.000]   You had to get an invite, though, to get into this one.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:04.480]   This is good.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.240]   You had to get an invite.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.520]   But it also means that you--
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.720]   if you start sending unsolicited--
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:10.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:11.160]   They'll kick you right now.
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   --reject off immediately, right.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:13.600]   Interesting.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.920]   I actually met my wife through poor web interface design.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.240]   It was on the particular dating site.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.680]   They had a thing--
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.880]   no, no, quite seriously.
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.800]   They had a thing that's like--
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:27.440]   if you want to know more about this person's views
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.800]   on this topic, click here.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.480]   So I clicked it.
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.120]   So a message has been sent.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.680]   It's like, no, no, I didn't want to send her a message.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.480]   I just wanted to find out what she was like on that one.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.480]   Whoops.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:36.980]   Oh.
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.840]   But she sent me a message back saying, why don't we
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:39.920]   just chat instead and--
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:42.200]   --the rest is history 14 years later.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.840]   That's great.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.240]   How did you meet your husband when--
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.800]   So there's going to be a lot of context.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:52.080]   My husband was actually my 100th Twitter follower.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.720]   There's a lot more context around.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.880]   Is that what we're having?
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.920]   No, but that was your first connection?
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.800]   Well, to be fair, no.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.680]   So that's the funny way of telling story.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.960]   But actually, I met a coworker of his
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.520]   at like a developer conference.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.440]   My husband is also an Android developer.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.520]   We're very fun at parties.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.320]   And--
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.400]   Actually, that's the corner I'm going to to hang out,
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:13.240]   to be honest with you.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.560]   Yeah, at the time I was doing a lot of developers--
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.200]   right, technical articles explaining
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.640]   how to do things, explaining how to do things
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.800]   and aspects of development.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.400]   And so at the time I had a blog, and I knew all four people
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.960]   that read it, and then all of a sudden I get a hit
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:30.360]   from my mother-in-law's house in Minnesota.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.720]   Like, "How do I know I'm in Minnesota?"
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.560]   Well, who would read my blog?
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.360]   And anyway, it turned out it was my husband.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.480]   Like, his coworker thought that I was a great match for him.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.480]   And here we are.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.600]   That's a good way to meet somebody who's a setup,
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:42.440]   somebody who knows you well.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440]   And says, "I know--"
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:44.280]   Who are the people?
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.280]   The old fashioned way.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.120]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:46.960]   All fashion.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:48.600]   At the time when we said we met through Twitter,
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.840]   and then we played games on, so we ended up
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.880]   playing Left for Dead on Steam together,
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:54.080]   and then we end up skyping--
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:54.920]   How romantic.
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:55.760]   At the time--
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.160]   14 years ago, that was pretty freaking nerdy.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:59.000]   You know what I mean?
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.800]   We never really disclosed that.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.640]   We're like, "Oh, we met through work."
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.840]   Are you excited about the Last of Us movie?
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.560]   I am.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:07.840]   I actually didn't really play the whole thing
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:08.840]   through any of my husband.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:09.960]   But I am excited.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:10.960]   I am a big--
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.160]   It was pretty faithful to it, actually.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.280]   Yeah, it does for sure.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.560]   Oh, I'm blanking on--
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.720]   Oh, in the game.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.560]   Playing Joe.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:19.520]   Playing Joel.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.040]   Sorry, no.
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:21.040]   I know who you're talking about.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.000]   It looks like great casting is like the thing
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]   for that movie.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]   Different video games.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000]   Mario.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.480]   Thoughts.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:30.480]   Chris, is it Chris Pine who's playing this?
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.000]   Chris Pratt.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]   Chris Pratt is doing it.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:32.520]   Chris Pratt.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:32.880]   OK.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.320]   Is he at least pretending to have an Italian accent?
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:40.040]   Teen, serious, tiny, as he gets sort of here.
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.560]   The Bowser voice by Jack Black is incredible.
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.240]   Well, Jack Black could do anything.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:44.720]   He should be--
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.080]   It does not sound like Jack Black.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:46.560]   It sounds--
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.480]   That's perfect casting, actually.
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.000]   He should be Bowser.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.600]   So we were actually talking about this yesterday,
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.400]   and I think my husband made a really good point,
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:59.680]   is that it's a really difficult thing to do the Mario voice.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]   Hey.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:02.680]   It's me, Mario.
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:06.760]   So either Chris Pratt is doing that voice,
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:10.680]   and being a bit offensive to Italian-American--
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.960]   It sure would be a story.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.000]   --and people don't--
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.400]   And then there's no fidelity there.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   So honestly, he cannot win.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.760]   So I will probably watch and just try
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:23.120]   to just not judge Chris Pratt either way,
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:24.960]   because honestly, that's a no win situation for him.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.280]   You're right.
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.960]   You see, I'm a big boy.
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:32.240]   I think Bob Hoskins should do it as the original Mario
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.480]   from the film.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:36.480]   I think Bob Hoskins is a dead cert for this.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:39.720]   Plus, as I recently found out, he hated the film so much
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:41.760]   he was drunk in most of the scenes.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.680]   Boy, in that show.
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:47.240]   He had to wear the plumber outfit, which was so funny.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.560]   His son is still ashamed of him for doing that.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.760]   If anyone out there has never seen the original Mario Brothers
[01:59:54.760 --> 02:00:01.080]   movie with the LSD-looking koopas and tares,
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.560]   go watch that thing, make sure that you are in some illicit
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.920]   substance to really enjoy that thing,
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:13.160]   and have a blast of how bad it is, because my god, it's so bad
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:13.960]   it's good.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.960]   This actually, I'm looking at the trailer for the new Mario
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.880]   movie, and it really is kind of stunning.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:19.480]   Gorgeous.
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.720]   It's an illumination.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:23.920]   It's gorgeous.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:25.200]   That's the company illumination.
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.600]   They do good stuff.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.520]   Yeah, that is some nice rendering.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:34.360]   I'm not playing the sound because I don't want us taken down.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:38.400]   But is that the Angry Birds?
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.200]   Are they in this too?
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.920]   Oh my gosh.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.480]   I think Bob Hoskins went from Super Mario 64
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.160]   from the Super Mario 6 Forgetting.
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:50.400]   Oh, yeah, look.
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.560]   All right, we shouldn't do this to people.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.000]   They're jealous of us.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:56.440]   OK.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:00.120]   Can we stop creating new movies and just start rebooting old ones?
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:01.320]   I'm the wrong generation.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.640]   I never played Mario because I'm too old.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.360]   And so I have nothing--
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.440]   there's no reference at all to this for me.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:12.160]   It just seems psychedelic.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.960]   I do think Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:16.720]   is probably pretty good casting.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.560]   Yeah, perfect.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.560]   That's kind of perfect.
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.920]   I'm just saying.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.880]   Little Tiny Break.
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:25.760]   And we'll have more with our wonderful cast,
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.480]   Win2Dow, who is a regular on AAA, as you call it,
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:30.440]   all about Android.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.840]   She's also now a lead developer at Adobe
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.000]   working on an Android version of an Adobe app, which
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.280]   sounds really cool and fun.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.760]   How many hours a day do you program?
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.120]   Do you code?
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.000]   Oh, geez.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.520]   A lot.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.560]   A lot.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.080]   I mean, obviously, we had our job.
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.160]   And then a lot of us--
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:51.520]   I mean, I think-- especially those of us in the app world,
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.040]   still code for fun.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:54.560]   Wow.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:55.040]   And so--
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:55.480]   That's cool.
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:56.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.400]   Yeah, on the weekends, I think, especially
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.760]   being in the Android iOS space, I did actually iOS develop
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.560]   for about a year and a half, because back then,
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.640]   there were no Android jobs.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]   And I had to eat.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.200]   And I was a freelancer at the time.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:08.720]   Did you have--
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.040]   Did you have a computer science degree?
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:11.080]   Did you learn it in school?
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:11.720]   I did.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.520]   I actually got a computer engineering degree
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.480]   from the University of Maryland.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.360]   I actually have a master's in electrical engineering.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.880]   Technically, I wanted to make video games.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.440]   And then actually, some folks from for access,
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.800]   because I went to U.S. Maryland.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.280]   And so for accesses offices in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.400]   And they actually came and gave a talk about game development.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:31.960]   And as much as I love games, I kind of thought after the presentation
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.240]   was like, I think I want to play games and not make them.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.000]   That's a hard life.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:36.840]   Take it from me.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.200]   I can spoil you.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.360]   You know, I became a DJ because I loved music.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:43.800]   And then I hated music because I had to play it for work.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:45.800]   It spoiled it for me.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:50.200]   Yeah, I actually visited the frex office while they were making SIV4.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:54.360]   And I think I just knew a friend that was working QA with them.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:55.240]   And we went to dinner.
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.560]   And then after dinner, this was like 10 o'clock,
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:59.120]   all the devs went back to the office.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.400]   I'm like, oh, god.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.680]   That's not quite the life that I want.
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.120]   So yeah, I do have a computer engineering degree, nominally.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.120]   It's been a long time, though.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.680]   I still don't know what voltage is, really.
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:12.560]   You don't need to.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.880]   How are you at soldering, though?
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.880]   Or as you would call it, soldering?
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:16.680]   Not good.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.320]   Not that good.
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:21.400]   I did take a circuits class, but it was all plug and play.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.360]   You know, like the nice old like Radio Shack boards
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:24.880]   with like the breadboards and everything.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.680]   There was no soldering left involved.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:28.120]   I do have a soldering kit.
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.280]   And I feel like in order to kind of bring myself up
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.760]   to the love of my professional colleagues,
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.560]   I do need to solder at some point.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.560]   But--
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.960]   You need to have like a project to work on.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.280]   Like go like build a burning man like Art Car.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:44.840]   He was in all that skills.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.840]   I feel like that's how a lot of engineering friends we do.
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:47.480]   That probably is.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.480]   That was the recreation.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:51.920]   But it can spoil you if you do something you love for a living.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.840]   There's a guy in the chat room said,
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:54.920]   I used to love drugs.
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:56.480]   And then it became a pharmacist.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.480]   It really--
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.640]   It could take the fun out of--
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:02.600]   That's a good one.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.560]   Something for you.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.640]   Ian Thompson is also here from the Register.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.840]   Ben Parr, I'm going to ask you in a bit about your new podcast.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:12.200]   I can't wait to hear about it.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.720]   First, I know you've been wanting to hear about my mattress.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:17.600]   So I got to tell you about my eight sleep.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:19.080]   I love my eight sleep.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.480]   Response or eight sleep makes both mattresses and covers.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.560]   So if you have a mattress you love, we did.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:30.920]   We got the Pod 2 Pro Cover, which goes over your mattress,
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.080]   and does an amazing thing.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.920]   It turns your bed into an amusement park, in effect.
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.480]   It turns your bed into the most comfortable, cozy,
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:42.040]   wonderful place in the world.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.760]   What does the eight sleep do that's different?
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:47.360]   Well, it both heats and cools.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:47.840]   OK?
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:48.800]   You ready for that?
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:50.640]   It heats and cools.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:56.960]   It goes down as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:59.720]   That's cool enough on a hot, hot summer night
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.920]   when you're sweating.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.400]   You go to-- and you just feel hot.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.160]   It's refreshing.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.960]   It's like, I feel like I'm going for a dip in a beat.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.120]   It's wonderful.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:10.600]   Or as hot on a cold winter night as 110 degrees.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.040]   Toasty warm.
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:14.560]   And that's what's so cool about the eight sleep.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.520]   It senses the temperature in your room.
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.600]   It senses how you're sleeping.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.000]   And then it adjusts the temperature to make you sleep better.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.600]   Good sleep is nature's general nurse.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.960]   It's the ultimate game changer.
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.120]   We all are looking for it.
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:32.520]   Still more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.440]   One of the number one reasons people don't sleep,
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:35.800]   well, they're hot at night.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:36.600]   They're sweaty.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.080]   They got covers.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:40.080]   This is so much better.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.440]   Fall asleep in record time.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.160]   Wake up refreshed and feeling great.
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:46.760]   So the way I have it-- and everybody's different.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:50.080]   In fact, with every eight sleep, you
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:52.160]   can have two sides to the bed, right?
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:55.920]   So Lisa likes her bed really nice and toasty warm.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:56.720]   I like it.
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:58.440]   And I think this-- I would recommend this.
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:02.440]   I start in the evening at about 10 o'clock when I'm going to bed.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.720]   It's a little warm.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:06.760]   It's a two on the eight sleep dial.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:09.640]   And then as I get into a deeper and deeper sleep,
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:10.320]   it goes down.
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.720]   The temperature goes down and starts to cool,
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:15.320]   because that's kind of the natural way your body goes
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.160]   into deep sleep.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:21.000]   And getting more of that critical deep sleep is so vital.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.960]   Eight sleep offers the only sleep technology
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:26.840]   that dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.880]   to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for you
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:30.720]   and your body.
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.840]   And then in the morning, my bed warms up again
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.640]   and wakes me up.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:36.600]   They even have a little vibrational arm you can use.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:38.280]   But I don't even need that because it warms up.
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.080]   And I'm feeling good.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:40.760]   I'm toasty and roasty.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:43.680]   And I jump out of bed going, wow, that was a great night's sleep.
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:47.880]   Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 19%
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:52.160]   increase in recovery, up to 32% improvement in sleep quality,
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:56.240]   up to 34% more deep sleep.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:00.000]   Those restorative deep sleep stages, 34% more deep sleep.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.640]   That's vital for physical recovery, hormone regulation,
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.800]   mental clarity.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:08.000]   They just launched-- and I think we've got to get it.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.560]   We have the pod two cover.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:13.320]   They launched the next generation, the new pod three,
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.160]   which has doubled the amount of sensors.
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:18.480]   So even more accurate sleep and health tracking.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:21.480]   You wake up in the morning and the bed is adjusting to you.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:24.680]   The sleep doctor will actually automatically adjust.
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:26.960]   It's not magic, but it sure feels like it really
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.240]   has made a difference in my life.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.080]   We've had ours almost a year now.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.520]   So we've been through winter and summer.
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.000]   And I can tell you, it's just great.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.000]   And I'm excited as the temperatures start to cool off.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.800]   We're going to sleep so cozy this fall.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.960]   You can too.
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.040]   8sleep.com/twit, e-i-g-h-t, spell it out.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.280]   8sleep.com/twit.
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.760]   Sleep cozy this fall.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:51.200]   Save $150 at checkout on the pod.

[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:57.800]   and select countries in the EU and Australia.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:00.680]   8sleep.com/twit.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:05.480]   If you go there, you get $150 off at checkout on your new pod.
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:07.120]   I think you're going to love it.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:10.240]   It's transformed our experience of sleep.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:12.520]   Kevin Rose told me about it and was just
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:15.040]   raving about it on a Twitter episode.
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.560]   And he was on with Amy Webb and she got it.
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:19.720]   And she's been raving about it.
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.040]   So when your friends get it, I have to get it.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:23.440]   And I am so happy we did.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.240]   Lisa loves it too.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:27.560]   8sleep.com/twit.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:36.760]   Thank you so much for their support for this week in tech.
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.760]   So you may be wondering-- you were mentioning how you're
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:42.400]   hearing from President Biden a lot in.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.040]   You may be wondering--
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:47.600]   a couple of years ago, didn't the FCC
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:50.160]   announce stir and shaken?
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.240]   And you weren't going to get as many robo calls.
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:56.160]   And you weren't going to get any.
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.160]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:57.520]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:00.960]   We weren't going to get as many text solicitations.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:03.680]   Honestly, my aged grandmother has
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:05.360]   more teeth than US regulators.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:08.960]   I mean, it's just-- it's pathetic.
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.480]   Well, they've heard from you, Ian.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:13.880]   And they say, oh, OK, we're going to finally crack down.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:14.400]   Yeah.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.160]   I'll believe it when I say it.
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:17.200]   Actually, it's been hard.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.520]   They don't have--
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.160]   there is a missing commissioner.
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:23.120]   The Senate has blocked President Biden's choice
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:25.000]   for the final FCC commissioner.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.960]   So they don't have a majority, a democratic majority on there.
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.040]   The chairman of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworzel, is great.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.760]   She was a commissioner for a long time.
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.760]   She's chair since Biden got inaugurated.
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.480]   And it has been, I think, very good.
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.160]   But it's been hard to get this solved.
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:49.320]   Finally, the FCC says they are--
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.320]   so let me explain how this works.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.600]   Stir and shaken are authentication techniques.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.480]   Stir is used on one side.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.200]   I think the receiving side and shaken
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.000]   is used on the sending side.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.080]   And hand in hand, it means that a phone company,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.800]   your carrier, for instance, can authenticate
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.600]   that a phone call is coming from the actual person who's
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.080]   placing the call and from a real number, not a number spoofing
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.680]   your area code and your exchange, not a spoof call.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:22.600]   And that by itself, if you just said, for instance,
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:25.480]   I only want to accept authenticated calls, or your carrier
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.400]   said we'll only accept authenticated calls,
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.640]   we'd handle it.
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.280]   Because of course, with the exception of political
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:35.720]   and free speech, First Amendment,
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.200]   they can't stop the political calls.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.880]   But all the other calls, they can bar.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.200]   But the tacos don't want to bother stuff.
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.440]   They don't want money out of robo-calls in the first place.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.440]   So they've been actively fighting against this.
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.280]   That's right.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:52.040]   And they got lots of money to spend on Congress.
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:54.760]   Oh yeah, and Congress is easily bought for it.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.760]   They're like free.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.560]   They're low sums.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.240]   They're cheap.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:57.920]   Sorry, sorry.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.400]   Get yourself a congress member.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.440]   Yes.
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:02.320]   Get yourself a congress member this Christmas.
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:03.240]   They're cheap.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.760]   It's a great gift for everybody.
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:05.960]   That's an amazing country.
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:09.200]   You've legalized bribery and called it campaign contributions.
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:10.760]   It's just insane.
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:13.360]   So the law was supposed to go to effect end of June.
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:14.600]   It did not.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.040]   But there were-- so there's two stages.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:18.240]   Next year, the second stage.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:21.480]   The first stage was if you don't have a facility,
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:24.960]   if you're a telecom company without a building,
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.440]   by the end of June, you were supposed to be, no,
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.920]   you got to do stir and shake it.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.480]   That hasn't happened.
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.800]   Next year, if even if you have a building,
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:37.000]   you got to do it.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.360]   The FCC says, at least today, that they're
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.920]   going to ban seven companies.
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:46.640]   They've received their final-- this is your final warning.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.960]   You are on double secret probation, mister.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:51.600]   Exactly.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:53.400]   This is your final warning.
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:57.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.800]   We're going to slap you on the back of the hand one more time.
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:01.800]   We'll say.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:02.400]   This is it.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:06.160]   It was kind of like the ruling with Google
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.880]   and its location data fine, like $85 million this week.
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:10.720]   They got fined.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.200]   And this was-- I got the press release.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.000]   It was like, this is a historic win.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.480]   And then actually went through the last financial data.
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:20.200]   That's 11 hours profit for them.
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:21.600]   This has been administrative costs.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.640]   And much said the same in Congress.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.520]   There is no-- you should start shifting to charging people
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.360]   on revenue, not profit.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.400]   And then you'd start to see some really big changes.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.720]   Because until these financial things bite,
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:37.880]   we're not going to get anything better.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.080]   And Robo calls is the perfect example.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:41.520]   We've been talking about this.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.920]   I've been writing about this for six years now.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:47.480]   Nothing gets done because there's money to be made.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.040]   I don't know.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.200]   Maybe I'm just a cynic.
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.000]   But you know--
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.480]   I will just leave it at.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:58.480]   I was an intern for Congress in the very beginning of--
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.000]   when I was in college.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.680]   And 75% of the time, my Congressman
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.440]   was in the outside office to where they are allowed to do
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.480]   phone calls to raise money.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:12.800]   And all he was doing was raising money because he had to.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:15.560]   And what that taught me was I did not
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.680]   want to run for Congress.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:17.200]   That's right.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.760]   A giant pile of money.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:21.720]   In fact, you get into Congress and you still
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.120]   have to make these calls.
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.040]   You have fundraising calls every week.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:28.440]   It's a never-ending process.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:28.960]   And we--
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:31.120]   This is why you need public funding of elections.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:32.120]   Well, we've got to be safe.
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:34.400]   Otherwise, these people aren't giving money
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:37.120]   to politicians out of the goodness of their hearts
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.160]   or in free speech.
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.640]   They want something for it.
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:42.560]   So just publicly fund it, massively scale back
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:43.760]   your election campaigns.
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.200]   And if you can't be bothered to read
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.680]   your company's perspective, then that's your look out.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.320]   Well, you're giving some reasonable solutions.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:52.840]   That's not how we do things here.
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:54.480]   Well, here's the problem.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:57.320]   The people who are elected in this broken system
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:01.960]   are the people who are going to decide if we stop it.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:04.400]   Well, that's not going to work.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:06.120]   They're the ones benefiting from it.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.160]   That's the problem.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.320]   Not to mention the Supreme Court, where
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.800]   their citizens United case said, oh, and by the way,
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:14.400]   corporations are people too.
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:18.000]   So just come on in and spend that money.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.480]   They're people on the good stuff.
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.080]   They're not people on the bad stuff,
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.840]   like going to prison or being held accountable for crime
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.200]   or anything like that.
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:28.280]   But when it comes to the central tax and revenue
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.360]   raising purposes, oh, yeah, they're people.
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.280]   Oh, they're people now.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:35.400]   Anyway, watch and see if you get fewer robocalls.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.480]   This is a bad time because it's political season.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:41.480]   You'll be getting calls from the president every day
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:42.640]   for the next 30 days.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:43.880]   Are you getting a lot of them in?
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:44.840]   Because I haven't.
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:45.880]   But maybe I just--
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.720]   I'm getting a lot of political adverts on YouTube.
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:51.720]   That is getting absolutely spammed out.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.800]   I'm getting a fair amount on Twitter.
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.520]   I've had some robocalls.
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.480]   As ever with the robocall thing, the first thing you do when
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.920]   it clicks in and say, are you a robot?
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.640]   And they've actually got quite smart about that.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:05.240]   It's like, I'm not a robot.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.960]   I just wanted to tell you it was like--
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:08.960]   2 plus 2.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   And you're like--
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960]   How dare you?
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.440]   I just wanted to tell you about your warranty
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.000]   of your car insurance.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.480]   But I haven't gotten one of those in a while.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:18.360]   Now, maybe that's because I now have enough protections
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.840]   on my device.
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.840]   Do you still get those?
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.200]   I get tax.
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:23.960]   I get tax.
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:25.520]   They've gone to tax.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:26.920]   I don't know how.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:28.680]   But I get tax from--
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:32.400]   I mean, if you cannot tell.
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.680]   I did not sign up for any Trump-related tax messaging
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:40.000]   blast, and someone hated me enough to put me on a lot of that.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.400]   Oh, that's a mean thing to do.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.400]   Oh.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:42.920]   Oh.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.400]   I got an unsanitized phone number a couple of years ago.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.080]   You know, it was a phone number somebody else had used.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.440]   And he kept getting texts like, you've
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:53.760]   got to pay your student loan, dude.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:55.360]   You can't.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:00.400]   And at the same time, you're the number one megafan.
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:05.360]   And for just another $50, you too can meet with the president.
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:10.240]   And it was mind-boggling.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.120]   How active.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.160]   This guy was receiving 20 or 30 text messages
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:16.480]   from a public in candidates a day.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:20.840]   Obviously, he'd given money once they bite into that.
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.120]   But the thing is, you can't stop that,
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.640]   because that's political.
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.360]   And so the first member protects that.
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:28.560]   And so no matter what we do, no matter what the FCC does,
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.920]   you're still going to get robocalls from political candidates
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.080]   and solicitations from political candidates and parties.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:39.080]   However, you shouldn't be soon.
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.440]   You shouldn't be getting any more car warranty
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.400]   robocalls or IRS robocalls.
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:49.120]   And one day I'll have a unicorn, which your next pure real
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:50.120]   ale.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.120]   And--
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:52.620]   --you know.
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:53.920]   At least it's the right color.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:54.480]   Yeah, I hope--
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:55.480]   Just to be clear.
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.960]   Isn't it really in?
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:03.480]   I don't know if you found a unicorn and you got its ale
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:04.640]   from this.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.560]   And you told me to drink it.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.280]   I don't think I could do it.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:08.720]   Oh, sorry.
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.280]   This from the nation that gave us Budweiser.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:12.600]   I mean, it's like, that is--
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:12.600]   I--
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:13.800]   --lub in a canoe.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:15.360]   --to no response to what was for Budweiser.
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.360]   --but not--
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:21.360]   All right.
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.080]   We can agree, Budweiser, is not a good beer.
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:23.560]   I was--
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.560]   I started talking about meta, because I
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:29.200]   wanted to warn you that there is a meta scam out there.
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.320]   In fact, meta has worn one million Facebook users.
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:35.400]   To be careful, there are at least--
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.840]   this is kind of stunning-- 400 apps on iOS and Android
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:42.640]   in the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store that
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:48.320]   purport to be nice little helpful things like horoscopes
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.960]   and VPNs and photo editors.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:54.440]   And really, they have very few features.
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.840]   All they really do is say, oh, good.
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:00.000]   Now, log in with Facebook, because we're all used to that.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.600]   Log in with Facebook.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.200]   And of course, you're not really logging in with Facebook.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:07.280]   You're logging in with the bad guys who run these apps.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:10.480]   And they are stealing your user account info.
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:12.960]   Well, I mean, I think this is why a lot of companies are
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:14.640]   actually dumping the Facebook login,
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:17.760]   because their security is so lamentably bad.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:20.360]   And the security awareness of their users
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.760]   is very, very bad.
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:23.760]   What a benefit, though.
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:27.320]   What is your risk market and stealing Facebook accounts?
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:28.800]   Explain that to me.
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.320]   I'm spamming, I'm presumably.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:33.960]   I mean, basically, it's getting leverage access
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:35.760]   to their account, selling that data on,
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:37.960]   and then spamming them out.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:40.080]   It's not just spamming on the wall.
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:41.760]   I've had a couple friends go through it.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.440]   Someone will take their account,
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.800]   and then they will start just DMing all of the friends
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:48.000]   and getting them in--
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.000]   Oh, yeah, we'd be there.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:49.920]   --slower risk games.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:52.480]   Because I trust my good friend on Facebook.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:53.840]   So it must be safe.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:55.800]   Well, no, but I mean, I'm with you on this, Ben.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:00.160]   I've had messages from relatives who, quite frankly,
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.360]   shouldn't be using a computer at times.
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.960]   But just like, hi, I found these photos of you, click here.
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:08.040]   And then when you actually message them and say,
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.960]   did you just send me this message?
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:11.160]   And it's like, what?
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:12.120]   No, not at all.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.160]   Oh, no, I've been locked out of my Facebook account.
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:15.160]   I think Ben's runs.
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:18.680]   It's that, you know, it's a trusted party.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:19.880]   You push it out.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:21.880]   I mean, ah.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:24.400]   Android doesn't seem to be hit so hard with this.
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:25.360]   But Facebook's used to be--
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.560]   Well, it's also the demographic.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.640]   Yeah, you go after normal people.
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:30.160]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:33.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:34.960]   You had a story on the register.
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:37.040]   I'm curious what people are thinking about this.
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.360]   Papa John's pizza place.
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.320]   Ah.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:45.760]   Honestly, I complained about not writing as much as I used to.
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:48.640]   But Brandon did an absolute classic job on this.
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:50.880]   He's like, Papa John's going to be accused of many things.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.480]   Like a lack of flavor for a stuff.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:54.040]   But you know what I mean?
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:57.760]   I mean, every now and then I will try a--
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.080]   I will try an American commercial pizza.
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:03.440]   And my goodness, they're bad.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:07.080]   I mean, yeah, they're criticized British food after this.
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:09.320]   But yeah, Papa John's was using a technique
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.880]   that incel and various other things.
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.960]   I think a lot of websites do this though, right?
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.360]   Yeah.
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:14.880]   Yeah.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:17.280]   But I mean, you have to opt in.
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:19.880]   So it's session replay software, which--
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:21.880]   So of course, a website knows you're there.
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:24.560]   They know what you click because the clicks are getting sent back.
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:28.280]   But this software watches the mouse move,
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.600]   watches what you type in, sends it all back.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:33.280]   If for instance, you order a pizza, then change your mind.
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:37.280]   They still get what you typed in as an order.
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:37.760]   A lot of sites--
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:40.680]   It was held for months as well and reviewed by analysts.
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.080]   And I mean, I don't know if you've been involved in this.
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.120]   But this is very common in websites like heat mapping,
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.680]   just to kind of get an idea of where people get lost,
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:54.240]   what features are working, what features are never seen.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:57.480]   It's a normal process, I believe.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.520]   I think about this a lot.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:02.560]   So even on mobile, for example, whenever you click a button,
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:05.560]   whenever and what screen you click that button,
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:08.880]   and I guess what options you pick in a radio group,
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:12.440]   it's very common to send those events out.
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.760]   And then-- so it's a spectrum, right?
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.640]   So with the session logging, it's
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:18.200]   like they have the play-by-play.
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:19.560]   It's like a continuous amount of information
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:21.520]   on exactly everything you're doing.
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:24.560]   And normally the way I have done it-- and yes,
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:26.400]   I have a moment of tracking events.
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:28.720]   It's pretty common to see, yeah, hot spots,
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:30.640]   what are people clicking, or people not
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:31.760]   clicking this new feature.
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:32.800]   And so it's an interesting spectrum,
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:38.040]   because in regards to what I am used to doing for my job,
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:40.120]   it takes someone on the product side,
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.240]   or someone really smart data person,
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:43.680]   to kind of take these individual events,
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.040]   like, OK, they click this button,
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:46.800]   and then they click that button.
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:48.840]   And then try to piece that together, right?
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.640]   It's more like in that case, there's
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:52.160]   a lot of different pieces of puzzle.
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.800]   And then it's kind of like our job to put that puzzle together
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.840]   and try to create user behavior and patterns out of it.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:00.040]   Whereas this is just literally just like--
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:01.280]   you know what I mean?
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:03.880]   Being able to tell blow-for-blow what a person is doing.
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:06.480]   And so it's actually making me a question at what point
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:08.960]   between the spectrum of we're recording exactly what
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:11.520]   the user is doing to this kind of more puzzle
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:16.440]   PC, like build your own user adventure style,
[02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:19.520]   where it becomes unacceptable, you know what I mean?
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.840]   And at what point is it really obtrusive?
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:24.840]   And granted, yeah, people opt in.
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:29.280]   But I think it's also user understanding
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:30.600]   of what they have opted in, too.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:32.680]   So yeah, I mean, it's very common.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:36.320]   And often a very important feedback loop for developers
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:39.280]   to know whether a feature, whether a user interface,
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:41.680]   whether something actually works.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:42.640]   Yeah.
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:45.640]   There is a difference, though, between collecting stuff
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:48.080]   that's typed even if it's never posted, right?
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:49.560]   Yes, that's-- In fact, I've seen companies
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.160]   get in trouble for that.
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:53.600]   It's not at all uncommon if you fill in a web form
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.720]   before you even submit that that information, those key
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:59.080]   strokes are sent back to the site.
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:01.440]   And I think that's often considered a violation.
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:07.760]   In any event, Papa John's is being sued for doing it.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:08.920]   That doesn't really--
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:11.120]   Not for that pizza, it's just a crime.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:13.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:14.520]   I think one of--
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.560]   I kind of want to hear your tear of pizzas here, Ian.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:20.400]   Oh, are you a Papa John's fan, Ben?
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.600]   I'm a-- we have-- you know what?
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:25.840]   I'm a neat-- I'm from Chicago.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:26.480]   I'm a Chicago pizza.
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:28.040]   Oh, well, you've got gee-hos.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.880]   Oh, no, no, no, not a pizza.
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:31.120]   That's a tomato pie.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:32.880]   Oh, that's the best thing in the world.
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:34.320]   And it's a pizza.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:37.760]   And look, I can love that and New York style pizza sense.
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:40.040]   I also lived in New York, and that is like--
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:40.480]   I love both.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:41.600]   Everyone can agree that's pizza.
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:44.080]   They're both great, and they're both pizza.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:45.480]   There is no Italy.
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:47.720]   Go to Italy and then taste proper pizza.
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:52.360]   There is, however, nothing better than Pepe's New Haven
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:55.160]   tomato pies.
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:55.960]   I just want to put that--
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.640]   I can think of several things better
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:59.720]   than being beaten around the face and neck,
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:00.640]   which we--
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:01.960]   What?
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.480]   You loser.
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:09.160]   This is the original pizza parlor, 1925 in America.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:10.080]   And if you've never had--
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.120]   I'm not talking about a rack.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.560]   You've never had their clam and garlic pizza.
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.400]   This is the pizza that lasts for days.
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:18.960]   You will taste this for the rest of--
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:20.360]   With clams that last for days?
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:23.920]   No, in your mouth, it will last because you will taste this
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.240]   for-- I know, because I ate quite a few of them in college.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:29.360]   Great pizza.
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:30.040]   Great pizza.
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:33.040]   My favorite pizza of all time was added in Venice.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.960]   Spinach, egg, and anchovy.
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:38.760]   And on a really thin, crispy base.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:39.120]   That's good.
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:40.000]   Just a nice hour.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:40.520]   Woodfire.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:40.960]   Woodfire.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:42.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.440]   You might stomach wanted to take me home and cuddle me
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.400]   all night, so no.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:47.880]   And I bet that Venice pizzeria did not
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.920]   spy on your web visits the way Papa John--
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:52.680]   No, they didn't massively overcharge us,
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:55.240]   because it's Venice, but you know.
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:58.840]   Papa John's actually--
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:01.240]   I think it's a class action, or it's intended to be a class action.
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:02.680]   They're trying for a class action, so--
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:04.280]   It's going to be a guy in San Diego.
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:08.120]   But what's interesting is they accused Papa John
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:11.000]   of violating the wiretap.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.400]   Yeah, that's a great head lock.
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:14.400]   It's fun.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.520]   And the California Invasion of Privacy Act,
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:21.360]   so that will be interesting to see what happens with this.
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:24.720]   I think a lot of these class action suits are just lawyers
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:27.160]   looking for ways to supplement their income.
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:29.040]   I mean, I think he made a good point
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:33.760]   where the line is thin and undetermined--
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:34.760]   Like the crust.
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:35.760]   Yes.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:36.720]   Oh, between.
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:40.040]   Is it this helpful thing, or is it an invasion of privacy?
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:43.840]   And two decades, several decades into the internet,
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:45.560]   we still have no idea where the line is.
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:49.000]   I think if you use the internet, don't you just kind of know
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.880]   that everything you do is being spied upon by multiple parties?
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:54.840]   But you don't think people do?
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:56.640]   Honestly, I really--
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:58.640]   I think this is the problem we've got to the stage
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:01.440]   where the first internet generation who've grown up
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.960]   knowing nothing but the internet, trust it by and large.
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:11.040]   And you need that kind of requirement to at least try
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.400]   and tell the truth and try and tell people
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:14.720]   what you're taking.
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:19.240]   Are you a fan of the cookie consent banner?
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:20.800]   I know you hate it, Leo.
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.960]   I know you hate it with a passion that burns like 1,000
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:24.920]   suns.
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:26.440]   But I like it.
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:29.080]   Well, that's being able to choose what--
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:31.600]   I will go through and say, no, you can't have that data.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.400]   Thank you very much.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.040]   And yes, it takes an extra 10 seconds on a web page.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:37.360]   But I like it.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:38.600]   What can I say?
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:41.200]   Can someone make my bottom third just be a cookie
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.400]   except it's like lined up?
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:43.240]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:45.480]   From now on, the lower third should just say,
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:48.360]   Ben Parr uses cookies.
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:49.960]   Do you accept Ben Parr tracking you?
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.160]   You accept him tracking you.
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.560]   Area man is arrested for parity.
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.440]   This is the first--
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.120]   Oh, this was so good.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:01.360]   --cun of a really hard time.
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:02.480]   I have to say.
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:05.440]   The onion-- so the Supreme Court docket--
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:07.640]   this is the first Monday in October.
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.520]   The Supreme Court says, what cases they're
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:12.160]   going to be taking, then they're argued, and then come June.
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.480]   They'll tell us how they feel.
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:18.280]   Quite a few of them will impact the internet section 230,
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:19.120]   things like that.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:26.000]   But this one, I think I hope, is a no-brainer.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.720]   A man was arrested when he put a parity of his local police
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:33.480]   department on Facebook.
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:40.680]   The Parma, Ohio area man spent four days in jail over a Facebook
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.000]   page he created that mocked his local police department.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.200]   He was charged with using a computer
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:49.440]   to disrupt police functions.
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.480]   A jury found him not guilty.
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:55.040]   And he says the civil rights were violated.
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.680]   He's trying to sue the city for damages.
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:01.200]   A federal judge rather dismissed the lawsuit earlier
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.240]   this year saying, I love this one.
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.400]   The police had qualified immunity.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:08.320]   That's, of course, the doctrine that lets police shoot you
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.760]   and not have to go to jail.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:12.400]   But apparently, they can also arrest you
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:15.560]   because you embarrass them and annoyed them.
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.200]   Appeals court upheld the decision.
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.000]   He took it to the Supreme Court.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.520]   They are reviewing his request to take up the matter.
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:27.640]   And the onion decided they wanted to get involved.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:32.760]   And this is perhaps the funniest briefing
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:38.000]   in all of Supreme Court history.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.600]   Have you guys read this?
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:44.040]   Oh, the Amicus Purik here, I briefly was fantastic.
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:47.360]   It really made me miss the old paper version of the onion.
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:49.720]   But even so, they did us proud.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:56.360]   They hired somebody to probably a lawyer, maybe not,
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:00.440]   to really spend some energy on this one.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:04.480]   Let me pull up some of the highlights from this.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:07.800]   They, for instance, they call the Supreme Court
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:09.320]   justices Latin wanks.
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:15.760]   Their point, we should probably start with their point,
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.800]   which is that parody does not need to announce itself,
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:21.680]   that it's not even very good parody,
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:23.840]   if you have to say the following is parody.
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:25.680]   If somebody works with a register,
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:30.360]   I think you probably agree with that.
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.960]   We assume that people read us knowing
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:34.880]   the where we come from.
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:37.560]   But I mean, this is surely, and I mean,
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:39.680]   America loves to build itself with, we're free,
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:42.680]   we're so free, we're the land of the free, whatever.
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.160]   But the very idea that criticizing your local police
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:50.040]   department isn't in any, is unacceptable
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:52.840]   and should result in four days in jail.
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:54.160]   That's ridiculous.
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:56.320]   Argument number one from the onion.
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.240]   Let's not forget.
[02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:00.000]   Parity functions by tricking people into thinking
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.680]   that it is real.
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:05.520]   Two stultus est, you are dumb.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.720]   These three Latin words have been the onions motto
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:10.440]   and guiding lights since it was founded in 1988
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:14.200]   as America's finest news source.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:16.720]   The onions motto is central to this brief for two reasons.
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:19.400]   First it's Latin, and the onion knows
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.560]   that the federal judiciary is staffed entirely
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:24.400]   by total Latin dorks.
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:27.360]   They quote Catullus in the original Latin in chambers.
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:30.160]   They sweetly whisper starry to slices
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:32.120]   into their spouses ears.
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:34.800]   They mutter Quibono under their breath,
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.320]   while picking up after their neighbor's dogs.
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:39.440]   So the onion knew that unless it pointed
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.920]   to a suitably Latin rallying cry,
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:45.640]   it's brief would be operating far outside the courts
[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:47.640]   vernacular and it goes on.
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:48.480]   It's great.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:51.200]   - The lawyers that got to work on this probably had
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.640]   just like the greatest time ever working on this.
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:57.040]   And then like, look, this one has multiple purposes.
[02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:59.680]   Like so brilliant of the onion.
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:02.120]   One, like obviously now it's in the news.
[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:05.320]   Two, it's putting into the news this ridiculous case
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:09.360]   that would have an impact on it if it created more precedent.
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:12.120]   And three, it's just hilarious.
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:13.960]   Just the entire thing, front to back.
[02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:14.800]   - Bravo.
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:18.480]   - Like lawyers can write really hilarious stuff
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:20.280]   when they really want to.
[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:21.840]   - I like it.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:24.880]   And the onion designs people that in 2012 they proclaimed,
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:28.600]   Kim Jong-un was the sexiest man alive.
[02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:29.560]   - Yes.
[02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:33.640]   - And then in fact, the Chinese state run news agency
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:37.080]   believed it true and published it along with a slideshow
[02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:39.440]   of the dictator himself in all his glory.
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:41.800]   (laughing)
[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:44.120]   - You'd be surprised how often that happens.
[02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:47.720]   I wrote "Napeful First Parody Story"
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:50.920]   for the not the rage my previous employer.
[02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:52.360]   And I got picked up by Forbes
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:54.640]   and run as a legitimate news story.
[02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:56.640]   And I put all the clues in there.
[02:31:56.640 --> 02:32:00.880]   It was about a computer virus spreading through VCRs
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:02.600]   which resets the clock to--
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:03.440]   - My gosh.
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:05.800]   (laughing)
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:09.520]   - And I even included a quote from Dr. April Una
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:11.120]   but Forbes ran with it.
[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:13.840]   And this was back when Forbes was actually quite serious
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:15.600]   rather than the clickbait of the rapping rapping.
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:17.400]   - Yeah, now it wouldn't mean anything if they ran.
[02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:18.640]   - Oh yeah, no, now it mean.
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:22.520]   But this was, you know, 2006.
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:24.280]   So it still had some credibility.
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:26.200]   - Points to the New York Times in their story
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.840]   about this brief, the headline is,
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:30.760]   "Aria Man is Arrested for Parody."
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:33.040]   Of course, "Aparody of the Unions"
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:35.840]   familiar "Aria Man" headline.
[02:32:35.840 --> 02:32:38.400]   So New York Times clearly knows what it is.
[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:41.480]   - Credits the onion also for their "September 11th Edition"
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:44.280]   because that was just what was needed at the time.
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:46.440]   I'll never forget that just like,
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:48.880]   "A the headline but also they have a little piece
[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:51.080]   "on the inside, best sicky ever."
[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:55.200]   Says commercial janitor at World Trade Center.
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:57.640]   It was that kind of, you know,
[02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:59.480]   it was what was needed at the time.
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:03.160]   - Yeah, this was back when it was an actual newspaper.
[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:04.600]   You could get in the newsstand.
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.440]   - Yeah.
[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:07.080]   - I did a video ad for them once
[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:10.600]   where they just had me talk about an orange bucket
[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:12.640]   as if it was like the most amazing thing ever.
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:16.200]   They somehow convinced a couple tech influencers
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:17.680]   to just talk about, it was like,
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:20.600]   it was an ad for like Home Depot or something.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:22.880]   I don't know, but it was a beautiful orange bucket
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:24.160]   and it just had all the features.
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:27.120]   Like it, like, imagine Steve Jobs talking about a bucket
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:28.560]   that, yeah.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.880]   - It has blue chips and everything.
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:33.760]   - And yes, it has the alternate protection.
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:37.040]   - This onion, September 11 edition came out.
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.440]   I want to point out about three weeks later.
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:44.120]   So, you know, this was maybe time to start
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.360]   kind of laughing about it.
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:48.960]   Hugs up 76,000 percent.
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:51.120]   U.S. vows to defeat whoever it is.
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:54.920]   We're at war with, but my favorite was,
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:57.160]   hold on, let me get this pop up.
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:00.560]   Hackers, surprised to find selves in hell.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:04.360]   We expected eternal paradise for this, says suicide bombers.
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:06.320]   Not knowing what else to do,
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:08.420]   Woman Bakes American flag cake.
[02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:12.440]   Yeah, you know, I actually,
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:13.800]   I don't think I read this at the time.
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:14.880]   I've seen it since.
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:17.920]   - I'm feeling disappointed they didn't do more with the queen
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:19.840]   'cause that was right for parody.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:21.720]   And it would've been just the kind of thing
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:22.880]   the onion would've been good at.
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.000]   - Yeah.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.720]   Thank goodness for the onion.
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.280]   - You can't laugh, you know.
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:30.040]   - You need satire, you know.
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:32.240]   Otherwise life, yeah.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:35.600]   Life gets terribly, sorry, go on.
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:36.720]   - Oh, go ahead.
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:37.560]   No, you first.
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.400]   - Oh, no, I was just saying, we need satire
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:41.840]   because otherwise life gets terribly depressing.
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:42.840]   So you've got to have something
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:45.640]   which puts a smile on your face, but yeah.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:48.080]   - I was gonna say it is actually nice
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:49.920]   to have a proper discussion about first and minute
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:51.280]   and what free speech actually means.
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:52.120]   - Yes.
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.800]   - 'Cause it tends to just bubble up quite a bit
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:55.160]   on your doom scrolling.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:59.640]   And I mean, not that I was at civics and things like that,
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:02.280]   but it is nice to see an actual proper fight
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.040]   about first amendment and the purposes
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:05.320]   for which that amendment was written
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:07.040]   and the actual context in which it was needed.
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:09.560]   And in such a delightfully entertaining way.
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:12.200]   So much plus on all these things.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:14.680]   - Whenever anybody brings up free speech on Twitter,
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:19.680]   I just post the XKCD comic number 1357.
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:21.480]   Public service announcement,
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:23.800]   the right to free speech means the government
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:26.320]   can't arrest you for what you say,
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.400]   unless you're in Parma, Ohio, I guess.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:31.600]   It doesn't mean that anyone else has to listen to your BS
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:33.640]   or host you while you share it.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.120]   It doesn't shield you from criticism or consequences.
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.800]   If you're yelled at boycott and have your show canceled
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:41.520]   or get banned from an internet community,
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:44.480]   your free speech rights aren't being violated.
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.360]   It's just that the people listening think you're in a hole
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:50.040]   and they're showing you the door.
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.520]   Always a good comic to have.
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:54.160]   - Just print that out for a year.
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:57.200]   - As usual, Randall Monroe has an answer to everything.
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.360]   - Well, the internet's called Jester is,
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:04.360]   I have a signed Randall Monroe print on my wall.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.960]   - Which one?
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:11.320]   - I think it's 386, it's someone on the internet is wrong.
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:12.840]   - Oh, I love that.
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:14.440]   - Oh, I love that.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:15.280]   - Yeah.
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.120]   - A classic.
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:19.080]   - I mean, as a journalist, you have to have that.
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:21.440]   I saw that and I was like,
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:22.720]   he's not gonna do a T-shirt of it.
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:23.840]   I'm getting a sign print.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:24.920]   (laughing)
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:27.760]   - As long as we're doing the register,
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:30.000]   here's another great story.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.960]   Boston Dynamics says,
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:36.540]   we promise we will not arm our robots.
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:39.640]   We are concerned about recent increases
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:41.880]   in makeshift efforts by individuals attempting
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:44.440]   to weaponize commercially available robots.
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.560]   Is that the case, Ian, are people doing that?
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:50.920]   - Oh God, okay, I can't name names on this,
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:53.360]   but I think Ben might know who I'm talking about.
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.400]   There was someone I know worked in public relations
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:03.920]   for an AI company, as I say, I can't name the exact one,
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:07.160]   but he was doing media training with their lab staff
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:10.560]   and he was like, so let me take the role of a journalist.
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:12.600]   If you wanted to, could you build a drone
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:14.840]   which could autonomously launch its weapons
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:17.120]   and kill people and the lab would say,
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:19.160]   oh yeah, suddenly, just give us the parameters,
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:20.360]   we can do that.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:22.880]   And it's like, no, no, no, you don't say that.
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:25.720]   You say, obviously that's something which, you know,
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:27.320]   company people will be looking at,
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:29.360]   but we would never do it ourselves.
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:32.200]   - That's exactly what Boston Dynamics said.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.040]   - Exactly.
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:34.920]   - You know, I mean, it's just like,
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:37.400]   the whole point of developing the Atlas robot,
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:39.440]   was it was a humanoid robot.
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:40.440]   - It's a combat machine.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.480]   - Which could drive cars, use human equipment
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:44.320]   and the rest of it.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:47.480]   And you're kind of like, we pledge.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:48.800]   - That actually knows what's going on.
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:51.040]   This is going to happen at some point.
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:53.400]   - Boston Dynamics, which makes this very cute.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:54.880]   - It's very cute of them to say that we won't do it,
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:55.880]   but they're gonna do it.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:58.200]   - It really makes you feel better about Elon's
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:02.040]   incompetent robot because it can barely stand.
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:04.480]   - Goodness, how can it shoot you?
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.560]   - But, meanwhile, Boston Dynamics robots
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:09.840]   are running around doing back flips, opening doors.
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:11.520]   We pledge, says Boston Dynamics,
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:13.840]   we will not weaponize our advanced mobility,
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:17.120]   general purpose robots, or the software we develop
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.440]   that enables advanced robotics,
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:20.400]   and we will not support others to do so.
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:25.400]   When possible, we will carefully review our customers.
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:28.080]   When possible, we will carefully review
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:30.240]   our customers' intended applications
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:32.560]   to avoid potential weaponization.
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.880]   - Neither other world governments nor the AI,
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:40.120]   nor artificial intelligence have agreed to the same thing.
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.520]   - I mean, look, as technology continues
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:46.280]   to evolve and improve, this technology gets easier
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:49.200]   for others to replicate and to build on their own,
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200]   and they definitely will not promise that kind of thing.
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:52.640]   And this stuff is gonna happen
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:55.760]   and how we deal with it is gonna be a bigger issue.
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.840]   You think the same thing about,
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:59.440]   God, we're going back to politics,
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:03.560]   but tactical nukes is another example of a thing
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:06.960]   where that's hard to stop, and that's a thing that exists,
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:09.520]   and it's easier to make things like that
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:12.120]   as time goes on, and we are entering a society
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:14.960]   where we just have to figure out how we live with these things
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:16.560]   'cause the march doesn't stop.
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:17.680]   - It is happening right now.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:20.240]   In fact, Israel set up what they called
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:23.360]   an AI-controlled machine gun,
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:26.120]   aiming at a checkpoint in Hebron
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:28.960]   in the West Bank city, the occupied West Bank city,
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:31.360]   just in case, you know, too many Palestinians
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:33.480]   showed up at the checkpoint.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:36.800]   Good news doesn't fire lethal rounds,
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:41.000]   just stun grenades and sponge tipped bullets.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.640]   And if you need it, tear gas.
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:47.480]   - And my wife knows someone who's in the Palestinian protests
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:50.840]   and he took a shotgun, sorry, tear gas to the head
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:53.240]   and is now in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:54.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:55.160]   - And I don't know if I trust--
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:56.600]   - John Leopold does not mean you.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:57.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:00.520]   - Yeah, I don't know if I trust an AI-controlled machine gun
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.820]   seems on the face of it a bad idea.
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:05.020]   I'm just saying.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.840]   Kim Kardashian's in trouble.
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:10.240]   Speaking of the Kardashians.
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:11.080]   (laughing)
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:13.680]   - In so many ways, in so many ways.
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:15.520]   - She has been charged with the Security
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:19.200]   and Exchange Commission and has agreed
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:22.760]   to pay $1.26 million in penalties,
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.840]   discouragement and interest.
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:25.680]   What's discouragement?
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:27.680]   - You've got to really rummage around the back
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:29.000]   of the sofa to find that.
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.160]   - You know, it's--
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:31.000]   - Seriously.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.440]   - I get, yeah, it's not exactly a fine for a billionaire.
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:39.440]   She apparently tweeted to talk about her,
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.040]   I'm sorry, it was on her Instagram account
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.720]   about her e-max tokens, a crypto asset security
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:50.440]   being offered by Ethereum Max.
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:53.840]   The post contained a link to Ethereum Max's website,
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:56.200]   which also provided instructions
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:59.640]   on how you could buy e-max tokens.
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:02.000]   She did say ad, hashtag ad.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.320]   She didn't disclose she was paid
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.880]   a quarter of a million dollars for the hashtag.
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:09.520]   And it turns out, and I did not know this,
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:13.680]   but federal security law requires that any celebrity
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:17.120]   or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:19.200]   has to disclose the nature, the source
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:22.680]   and the amount of compensation they received.
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.520]   So it's not enough to say hashtag ad.
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:26.280]   You have to say hashtag, I was paid a quarter
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.180]   of a million dollars to plug this bogus investment.
[02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:32.840]   Wow, so it cost her--
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:35.840]   - Fugus is a terribly strong term, and legally.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:37.360]   (laughing)
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:40.000]   No, no, no, I'm suggesting this is complete ether.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.440]   - Oh, I know what the discouragement is,
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:44.120]   they explain it, that's the money she got in payment.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.440]   So she has to give them that plus a million dollar penalty.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:51.880]   And she agreed not to promote any crypto asset securities
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:53.600]   for three years.
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.080]   That's kind of a slap on the wrist.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:59.240]   - I mean, she probably makes more like sitting on
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:02.320]   a private chat than she like has to pay for that.
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:04.640]   - Paris Hilton gets a million dollars a night
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.880]   to be a DJ at a hotel.
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.320]   - I got a scene Paris Hilton DJ and she is not a DJ.
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:14.920]   DJ's actually move records and mix music on stage.
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:15.920]   - She just stands there.
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:18.600]   - You stand there and you press a button on a laptop,
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:19.880]   that's not DJing.
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.640]   - This is such a tragedy of like our common,
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:26.040]   like our modern society with like influencers
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.000]   and social media where, I mean, this is,
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.600]   I mean the Kardashians every like couple of years,
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.840]   they have something which I think even like say,
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:35.240]   slightly less famous people would have some kind of
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:38.160]   negative ramifications from like four years ago,
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:40.120]   they were accused of like stealing designs.
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:42.560]   And then of course the whole fire festival thing with like,
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:45.280]   like the whole the kind of issues around promotion
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:47.560]   and disclosing when something is just a promotion.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:48.960]   And they just kind of, they're not just like,
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:50.680]   okay sure here the fine sure, whatever,
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:53.880]   that's like my lunch move on and do the kind of like,
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:56.240]   this cavalier like with much cavalierly,
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:57.320]   cavalierly with much cavalier.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:58.760]   - Yeah, cavalier.
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:01.680]   - Yeah, that's a good grammar thing to figure out.
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:03.000]   - Yeah, weirdly.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:03.840]   Is that an answer?
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.640]   - Cavalierly, is that an answer?
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:07.240]   (laughing)
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.280]   - Just willy nilly doing whatever seems a good idea.
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:15.520]   - Cavalierly is a, you know, and it just shows a show
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:17.720]   that with enough money, this is not a big thing.
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:19.080]   And I guess to relate it back to tech,
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:20.400]   just like with Google and Apple,
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:23.040]   like the rest of it is kind of like a slight bother.
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:26.120]   It is not an actual, you know, punitive measure.
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:28.000]   It's just like, oh, it's a little slight in commise.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.360]   This is not gonna damage the reputation, Lord knows.
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:33.640]   So I mean, I mean,
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:34.480]   I mean, I'm not a scientist.
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:35.320]   - No, I don't say I agree absolutely.
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:36.720]   - Absolutely, hell.
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:39.560]   - One cavalierly is now the adverb of the week.
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:41.760]   (laughing)
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.080]   Second, this is like, it is an interesting kind of like,
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.120]   introspectioned to both like the crypto world
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:51.360]   and like the reckoning in terms of just like,
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.040]   people getting scammed and like,
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:57.480]   we have no idea how to like deal and handle with it.
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:01.040]   Still, and you know, like we could go days.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.200]   We won't go into days into that one.
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.520]   But it's also looking to like our influencer culture
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:06.360]   because what?
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:10.760]   80% of kids say the number one job they wanna have with.
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:12.920]   - 88% of kids. - Yes, 88%
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.400]   - 88% - 88%
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:17.640]   - They wanna be influencers and they wanna be influencers.
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:19.440]   And so like you could forgive them.
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:21.840]   - Let's move on to the influencer.
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.600]   - Yeah, I wanna be given half a million dollars.
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.080]   I mean, I don't wanna be the old fart on the show,
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:29.960]   but it used to be if you were gonna be a celebrity,
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.920]   you had to be good at something.
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.520]   You know, and you know, you actually had a skill
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.000]   like a sports person or an author or creator or a coder
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.440]   or a security maven.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:42.360]   Just I take-
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:43.200]   - It takes skill, very different-
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.400]   - It depends, it depends.
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:45.760]   - Come on. - It depends.
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:46.840]   It depends on the type.
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:48.800]   Look, we're talking a lot about Kardashians
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:51.200]   because they're an easy punching bag.
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.760]   But like when you think about like,
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:53.600]   - It's literally in natural.
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:54.880]   - In one case.
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:57.200]   But like you think about some of the individual tech talkers
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:59.080]   who are like incredible chefs
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:01.800]   or just amazingly in depth in knowledge
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:03.320]   and science and in physics.
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:05.560]   Like that's like that is cool.
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:07.920]   And I like supporting that.
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.760]   There's other areas where it just doesn't make sense.
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:12.040]   And the fact that everyone can't be an influencer.
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.600]   We need people to build stuff and to run companies
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.720]   and to serve in government
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:20.760]   and to do everything else that makes society function.
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:21.600]   - It's-
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:22.600]   - I think- - Cavalini.
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:23.760]   - Cavalini.
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:25.280]   - I said- - Cavalini.
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:27.120]   - It's- - Cavalirly.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:28.760]   - Cavalirly. - Cavalirly.
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:30.080]   - That is a nice word.
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.920]   - In a way that shows a lack of care
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:33.160]   about something important
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.120]   or about the feelings of other people.
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:35.960]   - Cavalirly.
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:37.960]   - That's pretty much the Kardashians actually,
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:39.320]   you know, in a single word.
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:40.960]   - Kim Cavalirly.
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.520]   That's her new name.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:45.160]   - I wanna use a new adverb, caviarly.
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:46.000]   - Caviarly.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.160]   (laughing)
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:48.520]   - A little bit briny.
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:50.280]   Like an interesting texture.
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:52.120]   - High end and briny, yeah.
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:55.000]   - Leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth, but.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.680]   - I actually do not do NFT and Bitcoin rip off stories
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:01.600]   because there's so many of them.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:05.480]   And I just, it's like, oh, and here's another.
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:06.920]   I kind of wanna do this one only
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:09.480]   'cause it's so big, but Binance.
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:10.920]   - Oh, it's a Binance, yeah.
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:14.760]   - Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange.
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:18.720]   Confirmed Thursday's hackers stole
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:24.800]   two million BNB tokens worth $568 million.
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:29.360]   - Oh my God.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:32.320]   - That's more than half a billion dollars
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:35.160]   blockchain security company, Slowmist.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:38.240]   Not a great name, if you want my opinion.
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:39.440]   - Why?
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:43.760]   - Slowmist says the attackers only managed
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:48.240]   to take about 110 million because they suspended
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:51.600]   the BNB chain and so they could only transfer
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:54.680]   that many before they got shut down.
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:56.840]   - How the hell the hell they only got
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:00.840]   a hundred million dollars in this hack?
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:03.440]   - You can't, you can barely afford a private jet
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:04.680]   or a yacht with that.
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:05.680]   - Yeah.
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.080]   - Oh, those poor hackers.
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:09.320]   The hacker bitch.
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:10.160]   - Go ahead.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:11.220]   - This is gonna drive you,
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:13.560]   just when there's a coder.
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:18.360]   - The plan is that it's the biggest cryptocurrency platform
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:20.720]   in terms of exchange out there
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.240]   and they were still falling for a basic bridging mistake.
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:26.600]   How the hell are these companies in operation
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:29.840]   and not doing due diligence on their code?
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:31.760]   - Basically the move fast and break things.
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:36.760]   - The bad guy forged a message.
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:38.000]   - Trick to logic.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.120]   - Yeah, trick the logic until thinking of the contract
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:42.960]   to think the message was valid,
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:46.240]   even though it wasn't, there were no funds in the account.
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:48.200]   - And the BSC token hub just said,
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:50.160]   okay, here's your money.
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:51.840]   Thanks, have a nice day.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:53.160]   - Yeah, it's.
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:57.200]   Sorry, I'm going to wrong career.
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.160]   - Programmers are people and this is kind of like
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:00.960]   the point I always make where things like,
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:02.920]   where there's always like this,
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:04.800]   whenever something new in technology gets open,
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:06.480]   there's this Pandora's box
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:08.160]   and you cannot trust developers
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:09.640]   to put a good lock on that box.
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:11.480]   I think I kind of talked about this a little bit
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:13.200]   back in the show when it came to like the Android version
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:14.640]   of AirTags and things like this,
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:16.840]   is that we're humans.
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:19.680]   I mean, and you're trusting us to write software
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:22.320]   for self-driving cars, you're trusting us to write,
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:25.040]   there's very complicated cryptographic
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:28.000]   and blockchain technologies.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.400]   We're still people and there's no such thing
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:35.240]   as Bugless Code and it's scary because it's to the degree,
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:36.960]   to what degree when you make a mistake,
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:38.760]   is it going to hurt people financially
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:41.200]   or physically in the approach of self-driving cars?
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:44.680]   So, and like, I don't want to talk about the other person
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:46.520]   that we agreed not to talk about anymore,
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:48.560]   but it just gives me the,
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.800]   as clever and smart.
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:52.800]   - Just call them the Prince of Darkness, it's okay.
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:54.920]   - The Prince of Darkness and as clever
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.680]   and as intelligent and as technical
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:58.360]   as the Prince of Darkness might be
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:01.360]   and other engineers of that make,
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:03.440]   there's still human beings and being incredibly smart
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:05.760]   at one thing does not mean that you're incredibly good
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:07.160]   at every other thing,
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.120]   and every other core letter you're ancillary
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:11.040]   and adjacent thing to goes with it.
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:13.360]   - And we'll make mistakes. - Okay, absolutely.
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:14.600]   - Absolutely, mistakes happen,
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.560]   there's no such thing as perfect software.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:20.040]   But this is not the first time these bridges have been attacked.
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.840]   In fact, so I'm not sure what the bridge does.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.920]   I guess it bridges between one blockchain and another.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:31.080]   - It's a transfer function where you can arbitrage
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:33.880]   the entire thing, but basically,
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:36.880]   based on the data we've been getting,
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:39.600]   this is largely run out of North Korea
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:41.880]   and various other stations. - What?
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:44.200]   - Yeah. - That's how it is.
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:46.360]   - Is going after cryptocurrency.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:48.240]   - Oh, the attacks, not the bridges.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:50.320]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:51.320]   - No, no, no, no, no, no. - It's not the route.
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:53.440]   - Natural attacks and theft.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:57.560]   - A large proportion of this is propping up
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:49:59.200]   the North Korean nuclear program,
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.800]   not actually feeding their citizens
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:02.600]   because they've got plenty of those,
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:04.440]   but let's get the nukes done instead.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:05.680]   - Oh, that's not a good thing.
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:08.080]   That's actually not a good thing.
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:10.240]   - So, according to TechCrunch,
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.360]   cross-chain bridge hacks have become a common occurrence
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:14.360]   in the past year.
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:16.240]   So if you're coding up cross-chain bridge,
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:18.480]   you might really want to think about getting right.
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:20.720]   In June, a hacker exploded a vulnerability
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:24.320]   to steal $100 million from Harmony's Horizon Bridge.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.360]   In August, attackers drained $190 million with a crypto
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:30.880]   from the Nomad cross-chain bridge.
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:35.880]   And earlier this year, hackers stole $625 million
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:39.680]   following the attack on Axie Infinity's Ronin Bridge.
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:40.520]   - Yeah.
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:42.320]   - Now I mean-- - Everyone, please.
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:45.960]   Don't accidentally fund Kim Jong Un's brutal regime.
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:47.400]   - Thank you. - How new, what's happening?
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:48.240]   - Thank you.
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:51.960]   - Crazy. - I mean, this is it.
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:54.600]   If you're managing that amount of funds,
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:57.040]   a certain level of responsibility
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:59.120]   and frankly legal responsibility,
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:01.360]   I mean, we don't let banks do this work,
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:02.920]   okay, we do let banks do this stuff,
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.520]   but they got better lobbyists.
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:07.120]   But I mean, if you're a FIDI company
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:09.720]   and you're getting hacked this easily,
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:12.080]   you shouldn't be in business, you really shouldn't
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:13.440]   because this really is not going-- - But they're in the family
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:14.640]   and they all are. - Yeah.
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:15.560]   - Yeah.
[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:16.840]   Because it's the Wild West
[02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:19.440]   and no one wants to be seen to be anti-compested,
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:20.600]   but for goodness sake,
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:23.600]   some basic standards would be nice.
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:26.920]   - A penalty for the former Uber security chief
[02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:30.840]   who covered up failed to tell US authorities
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:34.400]   about a 2016 hack of the company's database is a jury,
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:37.840]   found Joe Sullivan guilty of obstruction of justice
[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:40.440]   and concealing a felony.
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:48.200]   So I guess he'll be sentenced to some later date.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:53.200]   He, when the Uber hack happened,
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:52:01.000]   he arranged for the hackers to be paid $100,000 in Bitcoin
[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:04.520]   so that they would sign non-disclosure agreements
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:07.800]   so that no one should know of what has happened.
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:10.320]   - And we know how trustworthy those hackers can be.
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:12.960]   - 57 million Uber users records
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:17.120]   and 600,000 drivers license numbers were stolen.
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:18.440]   So what's your response?
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:21.200]   Let's get a non-disclosure from the guys, the hackers.
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:24.580]   Quick, the payment was disguised as a bug bounty.
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:28.240]   So he has been-- - Boy, is Katie Missouri's
[02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:29.960]   pissed about that?
[02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:32.600]   Because that kind of invalidates
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:34.200]   a lot of the bug bounty stuff.
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:36.640]   - Yeah, no bounties are a good thing.
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:37.480]   Absolutely.
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:42.400]   In fact, you can make a pretty good living on bug bounties
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.400]   if you're a good security-- - Well, I mean,
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:45.000]   in terms of Android developers,
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.600]   there's a lot of people making some serious cash on this.
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:51.160]   - Yeah, and better that you get paid by the company
[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:54.440]   or by hacker one than by Zorodium
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:56.360]   who's gonna give you a million bucks for the bug
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:58.440]   and then sell it on to the Saudi government.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:00.360]   So much, much better that these companies
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:02.400]   pay these bug bounties, I think.
[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:03.520]   - As a journalist, I have to say,
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.800]   paying the Saudi government to get me to cuss up
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:07.520]   with a bone saw is a pretty good thing.
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:08.600]   - Good idea!
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:09.440]   (laughing)
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:11.720]   - Yeah, pretty good idea.
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:15.000]   - But the bug bounty's a great on this sort of thing,
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.720]   but I'm curious, as an Android developer,
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:21.600]   most people, most coders it seems,
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:23.040]   when it comes to this sort of thing,
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:25.280]   would prefer to sell it to the company
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:28.440]   for a reasonable price rather than go to someone at Zorodium.
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:29.360]   Is that correct?
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:32.600]   - Ah, I would think.
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:35.320]   I mean, if we assume that many developers
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:39.400]   have some sense of responsibility and ethics
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:41.720]   towards consumers and the people
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:44.360]   that they're finding bug money for, for sure,
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:47.520]   I would assume, let's just be assuming good attention.
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.000]   It's like, I would say yes,
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.120]   but I don't know, it's a quote from the Dark Knight.
[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:53.240]   Some people just wanna watch the world,
[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:55.040]   but I mean, I really don't know.
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:57.760]   I really do feel like there is a good,
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:59.440]   legitimate business for bug bounties
[02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:02.320]   and for developers, especially that are security experts,
[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:05.560]   but people are a weird man.
[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:09.080]   And I do, this kind of reminds me,
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:12.640]   Uber's just having not a very good year for security
[02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:16.160]   between this and the social engineering attack either,
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:18.600]   but I don't know, I mean, I've never personally,
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:20.480]   that is not my forte, I've never really
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:21.600]   participated in any bug bounty,
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:22.600]   but I can't help it.
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:23.960]   So especially for repeat business
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:25.880]   and also kind of like for a longevity,
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:26.880]   a career of a bug bounty,
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:30.160]   so you would wanna be more of a legitimate actor,
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:31.800]   but I don't know.
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:32.640]   - There's actually--
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:33.520]   - I'll say don't trust us.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.880]   - A fascinating story we talked about on Tuesday
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:37.180]   with security now.
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:43.080]   There was a pretty severe poisoning attack
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:45.920]   on the Akamai CDN.
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:52.360]   And the White Hat hacker, Jacobo Tediosi, who found it,
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:57.760]   didn't, you know, gave the bug to Akamai
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:54:59.160]   and hoped for a payout, right?
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:00.560]   Hope for a bug bounty.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:04.840]   Akamai sent him a greeting card and a thank you,
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:05.840]   but no money.
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:11.000]   So it turns out there was a mitigation.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.960]   So they went to Akamai's customers
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:15.520]   and gave them the mitigation.
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:19.200]   They ended up making $50,000 in bug bounty
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.800]   because the companies were so grateful,
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:23.080]   not Akamai.
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:26.320]   Akamai didn't even give him any swag,
[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:29.480]   but the companies were so grateful that they paid them.
[02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:31.760]   He wrote, "We are White Hats, but we're still not willing
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.600]   "to work for free.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:35.040]   "This vulnerability was very critical.
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:37.280]   "Our skills are rare complexes sought after.
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:39.640]   "We think they deserve to be valued."
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:42.840]   So while Akamai was patching following our report,
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:43.680]   but not paying for it,
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:46.400]   we chose to race against time by asking for bounties
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.880]   from single Akamai customers
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:49.680]   and actually worked out well for them.
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:54.680]   So they got $25,000 from PayPal, $14,000 from Airbnb,
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:59.840]   4,000 from Hyatt Hotels.
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:01.760]   Steam only gave him $750.
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:03.600]   Cheapskates.
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:06.800]   So made of only $400, but I love this one.
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:10.880]   Goldman Sachs sent him a Franklin, $100 bill, that's it.
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:11.720]   (laughing)
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:12.560]   - What?
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:15.200]   - Yeah, 'cause Goldman Sachs is short on cash.
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:19.000]   - So goodness, sheep skates.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.040]   - Still, they got about 50,000.
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.680]   They were happy with that, but that just shows you.
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:31.760]   I think people like that who are responsible White Hat hackers,
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:35.000]   "You gotta give 'em a bug bounty."
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.640]   Apple for years did not.
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:37.640]   And then they realized that,
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:40.240]   "Oh, they're bad guys, we're just selling this
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.840]   "to the Israeli company."
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:46.720]   And what was the name of the Israeli company?
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:47.720]   - NSO Group.
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:50.280]   - Yeah, I forgot the name because they disbanded
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:51.800]   and started a new company.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.160]   - Kind of, they're in the middle of the,
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:56.960]   but I mean, this is exactly the problem.
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:00.640]   There are companies who think that giving a t-shirt
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:03.200]   is an exposure.
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:06.600]   Is it a good response to someone finding a serious bug?
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:08.960]   And it's like, "Yeah, does that t-shirt pay my mortgage?
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:09.880]   "Then to hell with you?"
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:10.720]   - Have you ever thought about that?
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:12.160]   - You know, you pay developers.
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:14.080]   - Have you ever thought about that when doing
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:16.440]   that kind of security work?
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:20.040]   - No, it is really not my forte and it's very stressful.
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:21.480]   It's really, really hard.
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:24.720]   I took a crypto class and security class in grad school
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:28.000]   and I knew enough to know that I do not know enough
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.520]   about security to make a good living of it.
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:32.480]   So, now-- - You just look at things
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.760]   like row hammer, fuzzing attacks and stuff.
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:39.600]   And these are really like the edge of computing.
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:44.480]   I mean, really interesting, talented people doing this work.
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:46.160]   And yeah, they deserve to get,
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:47.600]   if they're gonna do the work,
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:51.960]   they deserve to get some more than $100 from Goldman Sachs.
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:54.160]   - And I was gonna ask Ben, is this,
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.200]   when it comes to sort of new businesses and the rest of it
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:59.840]   and getting finances, are companies willing
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:01.240]   to actually pay for this stuff?
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:04.120]   Or is it just seen as the standard security budget,
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:08.280]   which is your cost drain on us and, you know,
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:10.080]   it seems companies have a,
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:13.200]   they're taking security very much end of life
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:15.520]   rather than right at the start.
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:18.280]   - It depends founder to founder.
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:21.640]   I will say our co-founder CTO is very serious about it
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:24.400]   and made sure that there was a lot of,
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.760]   like there was a lot of additional security measures,
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:29.680]   but even then, you know, like a smaller company
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:31.280]   can only invest so much when they have to do
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:32.240]   a lot of other things.
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:34.040]   It just, it sort of depends,
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:35.960]   and it depends a lot on the industry you're in.
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:38.880]   Like, if you are in FinTech,
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:40.400]   you have to have that security
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:43.720]   because a breach early on could kill your business.
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:46.200]   So, and just like everything else,
[02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:48.280]   it's incentivized based off of like
[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:50.320]   the financial incentivizations of the business,
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:53.080]   but have I got to attack for certain businesses
[02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:55.400]   will kill you and for others it won't.
[02:58:55.400 --> 02:58:57.520]   And that kind of like, like, if you get hacked
[02:58:57.520 --> 02:59:00.280]   at your new e-commerce businesses that sells candles,
[02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:03.640]   like you're not gonna invest in that in the same way
[02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:06.360]   as a security crypto company or something.
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:07.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:08.040]   - Talk- - If you're not,
[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:09.720]   if you're a finance, I would hope that you're putting
[02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:12.320]   a lot of money into your red teams.
[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:13.440]   - Not enough. - Teams.
[02:59:13.440 --> 02:59:16.440]   - I was gonna say it, yes, no one there enough.
[02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:18.840]   - And let's take a quick break before we wrap up.
[02:59:18.840 --> 02:59:20.640]   I am so glad to have you guys here.
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:23.520]   Ben Parr, haven't seen you in a few years.
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:27.960]   You've been very busy, not only with your startup Octane AI,
[02:59:27.960 --> 02:59:29.080]   but with a brand new show.
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:31.440]   Tell me about business envy.
[02:59:31.440 --> 02:59:35.160]   - So, I partnered with my friend, Greg Grunberg,
[02:59:35.160 --> 02:59:37.400]   who you may recognize from the TV show Heroes
[02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:39.640]   or Alias or Felicity or Star Wars.
[02:59:39.640 --> 02:59:44.160]   - He's a nerd, nerds love him, fan voice of-
[02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:46.480]   - Oh yeah, I have seen and heard.
[02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:49.680]   Him and I tried to start a business together 10 years ago
[02:59:49.680 --> 02:59:51.680]   to the context, like we tried to start a business
[02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:53.800]   10 years ago, we failed at it,
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:56.240]   but we wanted us to try again.
[02:59:56.240 --> 02:59:59.280]   But this time, we're going to get advice
[02:59:59.280 --> 03:00:01.240]   from the top people in business in Hollywood
[03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:02.640]   so that we don't screw it up.
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:03.880]   - So you're still gonna do the business,
[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:06.040]   but you're gonna do it in the podcast?
[03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:07.600]   - Yes, we're literally building a business
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:08.520]   through the podcast, - Oh, that's lovely.
[03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:10.200]   - So we're getting advice from our friends
[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:13.840]   and episodes dropped on Mondays at, I think, 6 a.m. Eastern.
[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:16.240]   Our first episode was my mentor, Mark Ackler,
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:18.840]   who was one of the first early employees at Apple,
[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:19.960]   was the SVP at Redbox.
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.960]   We have some amazing people coming on the show
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:23.160]   in the coming weeks.
[03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:25.720]   Top VCs, couple of Hollywood celebrities
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:27.600]   who built base amazing businesses,
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:29.000]   people who've sold their companies.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.600]   The person coming on, I think tomorrow,
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:32.760]   sold his business for $200 million.
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:33.960]   So super interesting people,
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:35.640]   but we're getting lessons from them.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:37.320]   And then we're using that hopefully as a way
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:39.880]   for everyone else to learn actual, actionable advice
[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:41.720]   for like, how do you sell your company?
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:42.800]   How do you start a company?
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:43.800]   How do you ideate?
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:44.840]   And we'll go through things like,
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:46.280]   oh, we gotta figure out email marketing.
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:47.720]   Let's go get an expert.
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:49.800]   We gotta go figure out PR.
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:51.280]   We gotta go get an expert.
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:53.160]   Like the actual active building of business
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:55.000]   as a mechanism to learn stuff.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.160]   And Greg and I have known each other forever.
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:00.040]   So we just have this dynamic that you just have to listen to.
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:01.720]   You just gotta go listen to that trailer.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:02.640]   - I can't wait. - Yeah.
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:04.560]   - Listen to that first episode, everyone, please subscribe.
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:05.560]   - I will.

[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:15.320]   I wanna listen to it.
[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:17.800]   Thank you Ben, great to have you.
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:20.040]   Ian Thompson also here from the Register.
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:23.480]   - Afternoon. - Yeah, great to have you.

[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:34.640]   when to Dow, whose name I am, of course, mispronouncing.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:37.720]   But I'm doing the best I can.
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:40.160]   - It's just fine, just fine.
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:41.160]   - Our show today brought to you,
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:43.480]   talk about security, perfect timing,
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:45.480]   brought to you by SecureWorks.
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:46.840]   SecureWorks is a lead,

[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:03.720]   are never locked into a single vendor.
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:06.600]   You know this month, October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:10.000]   So let's raise some awareness about digital security
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.560]   and empower everyone to protect their data from cybercrime.
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:16.360]   SecureWorks has the perfect solution,
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:19.200]   it's called TAGIUS XDR.

[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:23.360]   It's not cybercrime's not going away.
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:26.360]   In 2022, it's estimated cybercrime will cost the world
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:29.880]   $7 trillion with a T.
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:34.880]   By 2025, that figure, it's gonna be $10.5 trillion.
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:39.760]   Last year, ransomware totaled $20 billion in damages
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:41.080]   that we know of.
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:43.960]   Attacks occurred every 11 seconds.
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:47.880]   10 years out, 2031 ransomware is projected to cost 10 times
[03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:52.200]   more $265 billion a year and strike every two seconds.
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:55.120]   Make sure your organization is not the next victim
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:57.880]   with SecureWorks TAGIUS XDR.

[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:14.080]   the true positive alerts, eliminate alert noise,
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:17.760]   allowing organizations to focus on the real threat.

[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:45.960]   whether you experience an outage on Christmas day,

[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:10.960]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[03:05:10.960 --> 03:05:15.960]   For our show this week in tech, secureworks.com/twit.
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:18.760]   We had a great week this week on Twitch,
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:20.560]   and I made a little movie.
[03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:22.280]   Well, somebody did.
[03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:25.240]   Just so you won't miss any of it, watch.
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:29.040]   Barbara is next on the line from Glendale, California.
[03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:30.840]   Hello, Barbara.
[03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:33.480]   Oh, what a surprise I got through.
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:34.720]   Oh, it's a miracle.
[03:05:34.720 --> 03:05:35.560]   It's a miracle.
[03:05:35.560 --> 03:05:38.080]   We do everything we can to keep people from calling
[03:05:38.080 --> 03:05:39.760]   and they still do anyway.
[03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:42.600]   Somehow, I don't know how it happens.
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:46.760]   Previously on Twitch, Twitch news.
[03:05:46.760 --> 03:05:48.760]   Welcome to name by Google 2022.
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:49.600]   I like work a lot.
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:51.320]   It's great to be in the whole room with y'all.
[03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:53.000]   Well, the only surprise of that,
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:57.040]   and it was even rumored, a stand for the Pixel tablet.
[03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:59.000]   Lot more details on the Pixel tablet too.
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:00.880]   I think I'm already seeing people on Twitter saying,
[03:06:00.880 --> 03:06:02.400]   I don't really care about tablets,
[03:06:02.400 --> 03:06:05.880]   but the idea of a Nest Hub plot
[03:06:05.880 --> 03:06:08.600]   that turns into a tablet is pretty good idea.
[03:06:08.600 --> 03:06:10.400]   Then I think we agree on that.
[03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:12.000]   Hands-on photography.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.960]   And today, we're gonna focus more on a particular tool
[03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:17.760]   that I rely on quite heavily.
[03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:19.640]   The tool is Scopes.
[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:23.320]   Yeah, Scopes inside of your video editor of choice.
[03:06:23.320 --> 03:06:24.440]   This week in Google.
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:25.720]   Elon says he's gonna use Twitter
[03:06:25.720 --> 03:06:28.800]   to build an everything app called X.
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:31.000]   Buying Twitter is an accelerant,
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.800]   using that space language,
[03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:35.560]   to creating X the everything app.
[03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:38.480]   The turning Twitter into an everything app.
[03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:41.040]   I think that's a really great idea.
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:44.720]   The challenge is, it is difficult
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:48.160]   in a way that Elon can't engineer around it.
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:49.800]   If even if he's able to do that,
[03:06:49.800 --> 03:06:53.480]   he's not going to be able to do that for years.
[03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:57.160]   And there's not really a good way to do it quickly.
[03:06:57.160 --> 03:07:00.080]   If you missed Twit this week, you missed a lot.
[03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:04.720]   And I hope you won't miss any of it.
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:06.800]   And of course, if you're a club Twit member,
[03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:10.400]   you can watch it all, add free a little plug for club Twit
[03:07:10.400 --> 03:07:15.160]   because it makes it possible for us to do so much more.
[03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:16.800]   For instance, that interview we did last week
[03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:18.600]   with Corey Doctorow, Rebecca Giblin
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:20.800]   about his new book, "Choke Point Capitalism."
[03:07:20.800 --> 03:07:22.520]   New shows we've launched like this week
[03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:23.880]   in space coming out of the club.
[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:25.800]   And there's shows in the club
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:28.320]   that aren't yet public,
[03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:30.840]   but are really great like Michael Sargent's Hands-on.
[03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:32.000]   Macintosh, Paul Therat,
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:33.600]   does Hands-on Windows,
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:35.400]   Jonathan Bennett's Untitled Linux Show,
[03:07:35.400 --> 03:07:37.000]   Stacey Higginbotham's book club,
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.480]   The Giz Fizz with Dick T. Bartolo.
[03:07:39.480 --> 03:07:41.640]   Plus of course, you get access to our Discord,
[03:07:41.640 --> 03:07:43.960]   which is really a great place to hang out.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:45.760]   It's a real social network.
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:48.040]   And the Twit Plus feed with material
[03:07:48.040 --> 03:07:49.880]   that just doesn't show up anywhere else.
[03:07:49.880 --> 03:07:54.280]   All the shows add free, all of that, $7 a month.
[03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:55.400]   Man, we're not charging enough.
[03:07:55.400 --> 03:07:56.680]   It's really a good deal, I think.
[03:07:56.680 --> 03:07:58.760]   And I want you to be in the club, please.
[03:07:58.760 --> 03:08:02.240]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit and join us.
[03:08:02.240 --> 03:08:03.720]   We would love to have you.
[03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:06.480]   And thanks to all of our club Twit members
[03:08:06.480 --> 03:08:09.320]   who make a lot of what we do possible,
[03:08:09.320 --> 03:08:10.320]   keep the lights on.
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:11.960]   And I think it's gonna get harder and harder,
[03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:14.400]   to be honest, and keep the lights on
[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:16.440]   as we head into a recession.
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:19.440]   Advertisers getting very, very skittish.
[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:22.760]   A lot of people sent me a link to a video
[03:08:22.760 --> 03:08:24.320]   from the Lincoln Project saying,
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:26.160]   "Don't use TikTok.
[03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:29.360]   It's owned by the Chinese government, watch out."
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:32.080]   But Ben, you sound like a TikTok fan.
[03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:35.240]   Are you worried about who owns TikTok?
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:42.160]   - Yes, but this is the like trade off.
[03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:43.600]   It is a great app.
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:45.040]   It is entertaining.
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.920]   It is how, I think of things in terms of like,
[03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:50.840]   the Gen Z does not really care that much,
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:54.800]   that it has affiliations of the Chinese government.
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:56.800]   And whatever security measures they say there are
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:08:58.400]   don't really exist.
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:00.480]   So you have to figure out how to work around that.
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:03.120]   I mean, I guess you can also straight up ban it,
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:05.880]   but I don't know what the consequences of that would be.
[03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:09.720]   So yeah, I don't expect that anyone's gonna be banning it.
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:11.040]   The closest it could have been banned
[03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:13.760]   was last administration and they did not do it.
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:15.240]   So it's not gonna happen.
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:16.640]   - I'm a fan of TikTok.
[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:19.480]   I really think there's great content on there.
[03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:22.960]   And I'm not sure exactly how the Chinese government
[03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:26.440]   could use it to co-opt us.
[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:28.760]   It's not the information they get.
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:31.160]   Even the White House likes TikTok.
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:35.040]   They are bringing TikTok stars in for messaging.
[03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:37.200]   Remember the Saturday Night Live skit
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:39.600]   when they brought in influencers to meet
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:42.520]   with the president to talk about the Ukraine situation.
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:44.960]   They just did it again for the Infrastructure,
[03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:46.880]   I'm sorry, the Inflation Reduction Act,
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:49.400]   which actually was the Infrastructure Act.
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:51.720]   Last month to mark the passage,
[03:09:51.720 --> 03:09:54.800]   20 influencers, content creators
[03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:58.320]   with devoted followings on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube
[03:09:58.320 --> 03:10:01.160]   came to the White House, met with the president.
[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:04.840]   There he is posing with all these attractive young people
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:09.200]   in the Roosevelt briefing room to learn.
[03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:11.120]   - What a single T-shirt there.
[03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:12.560]   That is not realistic.
[03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:13.960]   - That's their funny influence.
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:15.560]   - They knew they could not bring it on.
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:17.160]   I recognize a couple of these.
[03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:18.000]   - Really?
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:18.840]   - They're a news tick.
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:22.000]   Yeah, there's like one who just suffered the LA Times.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.280]   It's under the desk news is there.
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:25.520]   And there's a couple others I noticed.
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:27.520]   - See you've been, I mean, you've said people's search
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:30.600]   on TikTok, do they really get their news from TikTok?
[03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:32.480]   I mean, yes, yes they do.
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:33.320]   - Absolutely.
[03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:34.480]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:37.840]   - I mean, look, you know, you go.
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:39.120]   - No, go on.
[03:10:39.120 --> 03:10:42.160]   - I was gonna say if Biden really wants to get the message
[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:44.440]   out, he should hire the Try Guys to--
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:45.440]   - Try the word for him.
[03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:46.600]   - Oh, goodness.
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:50.440]   - I had every meme this episode.
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:53.640]   - There was a very funny skid on Saturday at Live
[03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:55.160]   about the Try Guys.
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:11:00.480]   And apparently one of the Try Guys was caught making out
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:04.960]   with the, what do they call them, the food babies?
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:07.720]   - The food babies support their food babies.
[03:11:07.720 --> 03:11:10.320]   - And-- - I have never felt so old.
[03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:12.280]   (laughing)
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:17.000]   - And so they had to fire a neck or a dead, dead foamer.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:21.600]   So anyway, I don't know.
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:26.200]   - They had to fire because it was him being in a relationship
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:27.200]   with a subordinate.
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:28.920]   That's the key thing.
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:30.080]   And that's what broke the internet.
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:33.600]   That and like he is known as the wife guy.
[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:35.120]   That was his fire's neck.
[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:35.960]   - Yeah.
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:38.000]   - And like look, this is actually like going back to like
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.840]   creators are bigger celebrities to Gen Z
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:43.880]   and Melania was in some ways too,
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:46.000]   than actual current celebrities.
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.600]   And we just have to know like this is why people,
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:51.160]   like a lot of people 50 years ago wanted to be celebrities
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:52.160]   and actors.
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:55.000]   You know, now they wanna be influencers
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:56.400]   because those are the celebrities.
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:58.760]   People cared a lot more about what was happening
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:02.400]   with the Try Guys than they did with Adam Levine.
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:03.680]   - I just wanted to show you-- - Yeah.
[03:12:03.680 --> 03:12:04.680]   - So do this.
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:10.760]   - This is the Try Guys-- - Saturday Night Live version.
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:14.640]   - Of the actual, oops, I clicked the wrong button,
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:19.640]   of the actual Try Guys sit down and conversate.
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:22.440]   It looks pretty close. - Excellent.
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:24.320]   - Pretty close. - Pretty close.
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:25.160]   - Especially Bowen.
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:27.280]   Bowen looks extremely-- - Bowen is a, yes.
[03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:28.520]   Bowen nailed it.
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:30.320]   Bowen always has it. - I would love to play you
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:31.760]   this Saturday Night Live video,
[03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:34.400]   but I know that it would immediately take me down.
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:36.640]   But it's the new season for SNL.
[03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:38.400]   And you know what, it was a little hit and miss,
[03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:41.960]   but that one, if you were following the Try Guys drama.
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:46.160]   - Well, that one, the internet's reaction was interesting
[03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:49.760]   'cause if you were into the Try Guys,
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:53.040]   people didn't like it because it kind of understated
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:56.880]   the issues of like dating and supporting it.
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:00.080]   And if you are not at all know anything about the Try Guys,
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:03.520]   then it hit home because everyone's talking about this thing
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:06.280]   that doesn't matter compared to things
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:10.760]   like the upcoming elections or your brain or things like that.
[03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:13.480]   - Should the White House hire Ned Fulmer
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:17.080]   to give them insight into influencers?
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:19.320]   I think that's the kind of thing you fail up
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:21.360]   or into a government job, don't you?
[03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:26.360]   - No, you go and sell crypto to people on the right stuff.
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:31.960]   - He'll be on Shark Tank.
[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:33.600]   - He'll be on the right stuff.
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:34.680]   - Right stuff.
[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:36.120]   - There's layers to that, man.
[03:13:36.120 --> 03:13:37.120]   There's just so many.
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:38.800]   (laughing)
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:43.040]   That's like, that is the internet burrito.
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:46.640]   - Oh, thank you, Ben Parker,
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.400]   the internet burrito of the week.
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:50.240]   Congratulations.
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:53.160]   - I don't know what any of you are talking about.
[03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:55.920]   Bruce Willis wants you to know that no,
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:00.600]   he did not give up the rights to a deep fake company
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:02.080]   called Deep Cake.
[03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:05.560]   - Well, he didn't, he didn't.
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:08.360]   I mean, basically he's given up some imaging rights.
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:10.160]   - They made a commercial with it.
[03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:11.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:12.320]   - With it's face in it, yeah.
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:16.880]   - But I mean, honestly, Bruce Willis is acting.
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:18.320]   - He's kind of limited.
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:19.160]   I'm pretty sure they are.
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:21.480]   - He has aphasia now, so he can't.
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:22.480]   - I know, that's right.
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:25.180]   - 'Cause he can't remember lines.
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:30.080]   And so I don't know, it seems like that's a good idea.
[03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:33.640]   It was a commercial for a Russian carrier,
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:35.800]   a cell carrier called Megafon.
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:38.280]   That's not really Bruce Willis there.
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:40.800]   That's a deep fake, Bruce Willis tied up.
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:42.720]   - It's so advertising for the Russians
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:45.520]   is not a great career move at the moment.
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:47.400]   - It was a fake, he didn't do it.
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:48.400]   (laughing)
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:51.360]   - Yeah, but he sold it, but call me Mr. Picky,
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:52.480]   but when you're invading--
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.320]   - This was a couple of years ago.
[03:14:54.320 --> 03:14:55.520]   This wasn't recently.
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:01.760]   - That's a real actor, that's a fake Bruce Willis.
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:02.680]   And I think it's pretty close.
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:04.320]   - I mean, that's pretty close.
[03:15:04.320 --> 03:15:06.360]   I mean, look, the deep fakes are like,
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:07.800]   you cannot tell much of the difference.
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:10.280]   And it's being employed in like the Star Wars universe
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:12.240]   with like the Darth Vader voice,
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:14.280]   which is incredible that like--
[03:15:14.280 --> 03:15:15.120]   - They got to--
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:15.960]   - They got to--
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:17.840]   - I mean, not just the Darth Vader voice,
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:20.080]   but I mean, Rogue One, when--
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:21.720]   - Admiral-- - Rogue One, when--
[03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:22.560]   - Tarkin.
[03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:26.800]   - And Admiral Tarkin, but also what really got me was when,
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:28.920]   you know, Princess Leia turned around and said,
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:30.480]   and you hope, and it's just like,
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:32.280]   that feels really wrong.
[03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:34.360]   You know, I want Carrie Fisher back again.
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:36.360]   I do not want an artificial voice.
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:37.800]   - I think they were creepy.
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:39.000]   I mean, and they weren't very good,
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:40.640]   but I think that in time--
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:41.800]   - But they're getting better.
[03:15:41.800 --> 03:15:42.640]   Like the new-- - Yeah, five years--
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:43.480]   - The guy who was-- - The guy who was fake.
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:44.640]   - Oh, no, you wouldn't think it was--
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:47.040]   - Five years down the line, they're gonna be so good.
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:48.440]   - I retired five years ago.
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:49.280]   - All of us.
[03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:50.120]   - People have no idea.
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:51.120]   (laughing)
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:53.120]   - All of us are just actually deep fakes
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:54.760]   having conversations,
[03:15:54.760 --> 03:15:57.800]   AI is just generating the conversations every week.
[03:15:57.800 --> 03:15:58.640]   - Honestly, Twit 2020--
[03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:00.160]   - Twit 2018 Drive Safe.
[03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:03.680]   - Twit 2020 29 probably will be just, you know,
[03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:05.920]   all of us digitized,
[03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:07.480]   will be out on the beach,
[03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:09.000]   sitting around a fake table.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:10.280]   John though, you have to be real,
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:11.640]   'cause somebody's got push the--
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:13.320]   Push the button's YouTube, Brittany.
[03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:15.360]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:18.040]   on the beach, we're going to be in a poor house
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:20.280]   while the people do the actual work.
[03:16:20.280 --> 03:16:21.120]   - No!
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:21.960]   (laughing)
[03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:23.600]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, here's what.
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:27.000]   I will sell my digital rights for a stupid amount of money,
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.240]   so if anyone wants to buy my digital rights,
[03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:30.800]   you can have a conversation with me.
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:31.640]   - There you go.
[03:16:31.640 --> 03:16:33.360]   - And then I will go sit on a beach,
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:34.560]   and I may regret that.
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:36.640]   It depends on how much you give me.
[03:16:36.640 --> 03:16:38.480]   - This is one of those parent Pandora's boxes
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:39.320]   that I keep talking about,
[03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:42.040]   like not like this kind of seems like an okay idea,
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:44.160]   especially in the case of Bruce Willis with the phagia,
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:45.840]   allowing him to kind of do his job
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:47.240]   without being able to do his job.
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:48.080]   - Yeah.
[03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:50.240]   - But it's really creepy, y'all, I mean like--
[03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:51.080]   - Damn right.
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:52.400]   - Like, especially with estate,
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:55.400]   like imagine like the estate, like I don't know, pick,
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:56.920]   I mean like even like, I'm sorry,
[03:16:56.920 --> 03:16:59.920]   the actor who played Grand Moff Tarkin is--
[03:16:59.920 --> 03:17:02.280]   - Oh, Christopher.
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:04.560]   - Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter Cushing.
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:08.120]   - Peter Cushing, yeah, I mean, it's kind of hard
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:11.160]   because, you know, rights of the, like, you know,
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:15.800]   the IP of your own face, like there's so many really interesting--
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:19.360]   - Yeah, Bob Dylan sold the rights to his music catalog
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:21.280]   for something like $60 million,
[03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:23.640]   'cause he's old and he wanted to leave something
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:24.480]   for his family.
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:25.960]   - Hey, Bruce Springsteen got really--
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:28.440]   - Bruce did offer billions for his music--
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:29.840]   - I know, I think that's okay.
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:31.760]   I mean, there's a difference between selling the rights
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:34.680]   to your music and selling your likeness,
[03:17:34.680 --> 03:17:37.040]   but you know, if it helps, you know,
[03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:39.080]   take care of your family when you're gone,
[03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:42.400]   all I'm saying is I will be glad to do that.
[03:17:42.400 --> 03:17:45.560]   - But your music is a completed art,
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:46.960]   that's not gonna get changed.
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:48.040]   - That's not future, yeah.
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:49.600]   - The selling your digital rights--
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:51.560]   - The selling your past, not your future, yeah.
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:52.680]   - Yeah, they're gonna, they're gonna,
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:54.720]   they could put you in any situation
[03:17:54.720 --> 03:17:56.440]   and you're not gonna think of every situation,
[03:17:56.440 --> 03:17:58.040]   whatever contract you come up with.
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:17:58.880]   It is very different.
[03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:01.800]   - You might be selling cell phones for Russia, which--
[03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:02.840]   (laughs)
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:05.640]   - Well, I mean, this is, we've found this out
[03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:09.360]   in the, we're currently in a political party conference
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:12.920]   season in the UK and Liz Truss, who is,
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:16.280]   yeah, okay, our new prime minister,
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:19.160]   elected by 0.1% of the population,
[03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:22.880]   but she came onto her stage to the sound of M people's
[03:18:22.880 --> 03:18:24.480]   moving on up from the mid-90s.
[03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:26.080]   - Oh, Lord, oh Lord.
[03:18:26.080 --> 03:18:29.480]   - But M people had sold their music rights off
[03:18:29.480 --> 03:18:31.480]   and while they said, you know,
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:35.760]   you know, we can't, you know, we hate her
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:37.760]   and everything she stands for, you know,
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:39.800]   they couldn't stop it.
[03:18:39.800 --> 03:18:43.280]   Also, all credits are Bobby Gleski from Primal Screen
[03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:46.360]   from saying, yeah, okay, we heard she come onto a 90s track
[03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:49.120]   and it wasn't ours, but once you sell the stuff,
[03:18:49.120 --> 03:18:52.240]   you've lost rights to it and the same's gonna happen
[03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:54.840]   to your face and to your thoughts and the rest of it.
[03:18:54.840 --> 03:18:58.360]   - If you're lucky, I'd be happy to, I'm just saying,
[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:01.080]   give me the cash now and you can have my likeness later.
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:03.280]   - All right.
[03:19:03.280 --> 03:19:05.240]   - Lisa might have something to say about this.
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:06.560]   - She's the one who's gonna sell it,
[03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:07.680]   what are you talking about?
[03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:09.160]   - It's a magic pool.
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:12.480]   - I could totally see her shopping my likeness.
[03:19:12.480 --> 03:19:13.320]   (laughs)
[03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:15.600]   - Just imagine four Leola Pores, there's a Leola
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:16.440]   four robots in it.
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:18.120]   - Oh, but it's the whole thing, yeah.
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:20.280]   (laughs)
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:21.880]   - Hey, Win, thank you so much.
[03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:23.520]   I hope it was fun for you to be here.
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:26.160]   I hope you'll come back with Win2Dow,
[03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:29.400]   you see her every Tuesday on all about Android.
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:31.200]   She's a lead developer at Adobe.
[03:19:31.200 --> 03:19:33.160]   Now you have to stick your tongue out when you do that.
[03:19:33.160 --> 03:19:36.000]   Queen Code Monkey, that's it, nice!
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:37.480]   And she's an influencer.
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:39.520]   She's the whole internet burrito.
[03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:40.360]   - Oh, gosh, no, she's not.
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:41.200]   - No, no.
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:42.880]   Too late, influencer.
[03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:46.160]   - No, no, no influencing around here, please.
[03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:47.760]   - Okay, we are gonna use that image
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:50.720]   because of the thumbnail, so I'm sorry, you're stuck.
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:51.560]   - All right, sorry.
[03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:52.920]   - You're right, you signed over.
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:55.400]   - I'm gonna play my digital break.
[03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:57.280]   - Anyway, really a pleasure, you're great.
[03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.880]   Thank you, thank you, thank you for being here.
[03:19:58.880 --> 03:19:59.880]   - Thank you so much, Lee, I was a special asset.
[03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:00.800]   - I really appreciate it.
[03:20:00.800 --> 03:20:02.360]   Same to you, Ian Thompson.
[03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:04.040]   We've been plugging for everybody else.
[03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:05.680]   What do you wanna plug, anything?
[03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:09.720]   - Oh, well, I'm in the red carousel,
[03:20:09.720 --> 03:20:13.280]   we've done it for 25 years, and we punch well above our weight,
[03:20:13.280 --> 03:20:15.400]   but in sense of plugging stuff,
[03:20:15.400 --> 03:20:18.200]   I would like to say, an ex-redged journalist
[03:20:18.200 --> 03:20:21.600]   who left us last year is now a director on Nominek
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:24.320]   because he ran a number of serious articles
[03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:27.000]   pointing out how they were trying to turn a domain,
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:30.360]   a nonprofit domain into a profit center of private equity.
[03:20:30.360 --> 03:20:33.480]   He exposed that, he's now been elected by the members.
[03:20:33.480 --> 03:20:35.760]   - That is fantastic.
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:37.560]   - Ooh, that is-- - Yeah, that was--
[03:20:37.560 --> 03:20:40.080]   Nominek is the UK registrar, right?
[03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:40.920]   The big UK registrar.
[03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:43.920]   - It runs the dot-code.uk domain,
[03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:45.560]   and it was one of those stories
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:47.640]   which already warmed the cockles of my heart
[03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:51.120]   because everyone says journalism doesn't do anything anymore
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:52.720]   and the rest of it.
[03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:55.720]   Karen spent four years researching this stuff,
[03:20:55.720 --> 03:21:00.200]   this move from the domain used to run dot-code.uk
[03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:05.200]   as a nonprofit and any excess profits went to charity.
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:07.640]   Then a new bunch of people took over,
[03:21:07.640 --> 03:21:10.960]   they wanted to make it to a profit center,
[03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:13.480]   they set up a private equity firm to buy it,
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:16.240]   they stopped doing charitable donations.
[03:21:16.240 --> 03:21:18.120]   He reported on all of this.
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:21.480]   Sadly, we lost him 'cause he wanted to move back to the UK,
[03:21:21.480 --> 03:21:24.120]   but he was elected by the members
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:27.560]   and now we're gonna get some serious oversight.
[03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:30.360]   But this is something that domain holders
[03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:32.400]   really need to watch out for
[03:21:32.400 --> 03:21:34.760]   because private equity is moving into the sphere
[03:21:34.760 --> 03:21:36.120]   in a big way.
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:40.480]   Because these are basically established industries,
[03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:42.960]   if you're running a dot org, for example,
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:46.560]   or a dot-code at UK or a specialized URL,
[03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:51.840]   you are tied into that, you've been into it for 10, 15 years.
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:53.760]   And when a company takes us over and says,
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:21:58.760]   "Right, we're gonna charge you 5% more each year for what?"
[03:21:58.760 --> 03:22:01.360]   It's running a domain, it's easy.
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:03.480]   So just watch out for this.
[03:22:03.480 --> 03:22:04.960]   If you're running a domain
[03:22:04.960 --> 03:22:07.920]   and your domain is getting taken over, vote,
[03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:10.040]   get involved, get sorted.
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:12.360]   Awesome.
[03:22:12.360 --> 03:22:14.040]   - As you write-- - Oh, that's my rat for the day.
[03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:14.880]   - No, I love it.
[03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:17.040]   As you write on the register,
[03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:19.520]   Kieran McCarthy, former registered journalist,
[03:22:19.520 --> 03:22:22.520]   is here to chew bubble gum and kick Nominate ass.
[03:22:22.520 --> 03:22:24.800]   And he's all out of bubble gum.
[03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:27.280]   - So I would not like to go up against Kieran.
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:29.560]   He's one of my oldest friends in the US
[03:22:29.560 --> 03:22:31.280]   and now he's moved back to the UK,
[03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:33.440]   but do not go up against this guy
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:36.160]   'cause you will go down with his teeth in your throat.
[03:22:36.160 --> 03:22:37.160]   - That is really great.
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:39.800]   Congratulations, Kieran, that's really good news.
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:42.680]   Is he leaving the register to do this or is he gonna--
[03:22:42.680 --> 03:22:44.760]   - Yeah, he left the register because
[03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:48.880]   he got sick of Bay Area schools
[03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:50.120]   and the healthcare system.
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:51.120]   (laughing)
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:52.360]   - He wanted to go home.
[03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:57.520]   - Well, honestly, I love being over here,
[03:22:57.520 --> 03:22:59.360]   but you're making-- - You're a citizen now.
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:00.520]   - Of course sometimes.
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:03.560]   Not quite, no, I haven't taken that leap.
[03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:05.320]   I have learned an awful lot more
[03:23:05.320 --> 03:23:08.440]   about the US Constitution than I ever knew,
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:10.560]   which is why the first-- - Or than any other
[03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:13.680]   American native knows, I might add.
[03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:16.040]   - Well, seriously, I've asked a bunch of Americans
[03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:18.960]   how many members are in Congress and no one knows.
[03:23:18.960 --> 03:23:21.320]   - You know, it's 538, yeah.
[03:23:21.320 --> 03:23:27.080]   It's a mad thing, but-- - It's 538 representatives.
[03:23:27.080 --> 03:23:28.520]   - No, no, 438.
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:29.760]   - 438. - 438.
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:31.040]   - 435, surely.
[03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:32.960]   - 435 and then three from DC.
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:34.120]   - Three from DC.
[03:23:34.120 --> 03:23:36.880]   - Oh, the DC. - 538, it's 538
[03:23:36.880 --> 03:23:37.920]   because you got 100 from--
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:39.680]   - 7 years. - Because you get 538 electors
[03:23:39.680 --> 03:23:41.640]   and you get three additional-- anyway.
[03:23:41.640 --> 03:23:43.440]   - It's a collector. - I did study political science.
[03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:45.000]   - Very good, nice. - This is--
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.560]   - Brilliant, good class. - It's one of my favorite
[03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:50.680]   Simpsons scenes is when a poo goes for citizenship
[03:23:50.680 --> 03:23:52.960]   and they're so, what was the cause of the Civil Wars?
[03:23:52.960 --> 03:23:54.720]   Actually, the causes were many in multiple,
[03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:56.920]   but not leaving aside slavery thing.
[03:23:56.920 --> 03:23:58.880]   There was, just say slavery, yes.
[03:23:58.880 --> 03:24:01.200]   - Slavery, which way to the welfare of it?
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:02.440]   - One word answer.
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:04.240]   - Hey, thank you Ian, such a pleasure.
[03:24:04.240 --> 03:24:06.480]   Always come up with a bacon buddy
[03:24:06.480 --> 03:24:09.640]   sometime together and it'll be a lot of fun, I appreciate.
[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:12.080]   Have you watched on HBO?
[03:24:12.080 --> 03:24:14.760]   Have you watched the show industry yet?
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:16.920]   - No, must watch. - No, I haven't even heard of it.
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:21.920]   - Oh, it's a British show about a financial services company
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:25.760]   called PurePoint, somewhat like Goldman Sachs.
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:29.040]   It is really engaging especially in second season.
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:30.800]   - Right, okay, that's going to be a lot too well.
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:34.040]   - It takes a little while, but by the second season,
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:36.920]   you're like, oh wow, this is a great show.
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:38.320]   Just wanted to mention that.
[03:24:38.320 --> 03:24:40.160]   - Thank you very much indeed.
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:43.000]   Oh, and by the way, since we're recommending shows
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:46.080]   and I know that it was a music you want to go about this,
[03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:49.560]   Derry Girls is down a third season, seriously, watch it.
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:52.480]   - D-E-R-R-Y, I thought it was D-A-I-R-Y
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:53.720]   and I couldn't figure it out.
[03:24:53.720 --> 03:24:55.240]   - D-E-R-Y, and yes. - D-E-R-Y.
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:24:57.200]   - They're from Derry, Ireland.
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:01.320]   Derry girls, they're sweet, they're so good.
[03:25:01.320 --> 03:25:03.040]   And I can't watch this show.
[03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:03.880]   - It's such a good series.
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:08.280]   - Season three, Derry Girls, I love Derry to Derry Girls.
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:09.920]   Thank you.
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:11.920]   Thank you also, Ben Parr, hey, it's really great
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:12.760]   to see you again.
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:15.240]   We had dinner a few months ago.
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:18.240]   It was really great to see you and your girl,
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:19.680]   your woman, whatever, I don't know,
[03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:21.240]   what do you call people these days?
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:23.400]   You're a friend.
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:24.800]   - You're so mate, you're--
[03:25:24.800 --> 03:25:26.640]   - Aww.
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:27.480]   - There you go, that's cool.
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:28.880]   - That's cool. - That's that one.
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:30.400]   We had a lovely dinner and I said,
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:33.320]   Ben, the minute your new podcast comes out,

[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:46.720]   Yes, kids, there were podcasts back in 2005.
[03:26:46.720 --> 03:26:48.400]   That's when we started.

[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:54.760]   - It's this. - Okay.
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:55.600]   - It's amazing.
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:58.180]   (upbeat music)
[03:26:58.180 --> 03:27:00.760]   (upbeat music)
