[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, the show where we cover the weeks. Tech News, why I like this panel.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   This is going to be a very interesting show, that's my prediction.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   We'll start over here on my left, Cashmere Heal is here from Fusion,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   where she works so hard on a lovely enterprise called Real Future. Hello, Cashmere, great to have you.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Hello, nice to be on.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   You hacked a stranger's smartphone, you lived on Bitcoin, and you played a surprise visit to the NSA's Utah Data Center.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Better than hacking a stranger's smartphone, I hacked their home.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Oh, even a smart home?
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   That's trivial.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   That's so much easier.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   It was, it was, disturbingly, yeah.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   It involved the Google search.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I mean, I thought you were a lead hacker, but no, she just hacked a smart house. That's easy.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   They're just sitting there, sitting ducks.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   We did actually did a whole show this week on security now on baby monitors, which are trivially easy to have.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   They're getting hacked, yeah, they've been getting hacked for years.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   They're not able to improve the security.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   My brother has one of the, he had, like, the monitoring camera from the same company that had those baby cameras.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   They got hacked here.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   And one day he's sitting there watching TV his wife's ironing, and he hears from the camera.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Oh.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   Hey, you.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   Oh, you guy watching TV.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   Hey, lady.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   Hey, you lady ironing.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   He's like, oh my God, he's like turned everything off.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   My camera's talking to me.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   That's a bird, a bald one from Engagie.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Hey, I want to do that.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   That would be fun.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   I want to do that to people.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   He was kind of freaked out.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   Hey, you.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Hey, you.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Hey, you guy watching television.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Also with us, and it's kind of an interesting story here.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   David Korsie, who I think is an old friend, and I've been on our shows many times, but he asserts he's never been on our...
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   You are an old friend.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Yes.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   I've been in your studio.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   Yes.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   I've been in studios that you have been in just before I was in, but I don't think you and I have ever conversed in front of an audience.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Well, yeah, I don't think so.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   I've known David for more than two decades.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   I can't understand this.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   Anyway, David's been knocking around with the tech reporting for years.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   You saw him on CNET.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   He was at Forbes.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   He was...
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Where else?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   M-O-P-C letter.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   Everywhere.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   Info world.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   P-C letter for a while.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Did you demo?
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   Yeah, I was at ZIF for a little while.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   I've written for...
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   I've been everywhere.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   E-Week.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   I've been...
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   I've done USA Today.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   You know, the funny story, a lot of people tweeted me when the news came out.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   The Gawker was going in bankruptcy and was going to sell out to ZIF Davis.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   They said, "Oh, you must laugh at that as a long time like you, David."
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   ZIF Davis employee.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   And I said, "No, wait, that's not ZIF Davis."
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   That doesn't...
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   The people who own PC Magazine Extreme Tech, the old ZIF Davis assets are far from ZIF Davis.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   It's J-2 Global.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   They're known for...
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   It's not built ZIF anymore.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   Oh, it has been built ZIF for years.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   But now it's like...
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   It's the strangest thing.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   I think, is J-2 Global, they do E-Voice and E-Facts.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   Oh, E-Facts.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   I mean, that's a big one.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   Well, apparently they've made some money because they've then started to buy up content, digital
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   content stuff.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   So they bought PC Magazine.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   That's where they...
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   I guess you get the name ZIF Davis.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.280]   But it ain't your father's ZIF Davis.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.480]   It's a very strange conglomeration.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.480]   So I don't know.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   Well, they needed another E, so they bought E-Week.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   E-Week.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yeah, E-Week.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   E-Week.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   E-Week.com.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   Fuse mail.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   It's a strange...
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.200]   We live in strange times.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.480]   That's all I can say.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   It's diversified.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.200]   So what do you think of this galker thing?
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.400]   Galker announced that because they have to put up the money that they owe Hulk Hogan $140
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.440]   million, they can't do it.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.720]   Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and they put themselves up for sale.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.080]   And I don't know if the news, if Davis will get them or not, but they've put up at $100
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.840]   million bid, which is kind of the starting point for the auction.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.120]   If nobody else comes along, then they will.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.320]   We were talking before the show began.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.880]   I mean, this is kind of one of those...
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.520]   For journalists, no win situations.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.960]   On the one hand, galker dragged journalism through the mud in some respects.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.680]   Well, I think a lot of publications over the years have dragged journalism through the
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   mud.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.640]   I mean, they've done some good work, but you're only going to remember, like, you know, what
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   I worked at Gizmodo for six months.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   Gizmodo is good.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   Jill Lopnik's good.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.240]   Is this some talk to his good?
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.000]   I have, you know, galkers galker.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And there's...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.480]   I knew there was a relationship with Nick.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   Do you like him?
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   Is he a nice guy?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   Right.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   I don't really...
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   I don't have a relationship with Nick.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   That's my relationship.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.880]   I talked to him once when I got hired at Gizmodo, and then I might have said hi to him at a
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   company party.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   And that's really about it.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.680]   I've never had a conversation with him other than hi, welcome to Gizmodo.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.880]   I think it's your point in the money.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.760]   Nick Denton and Owen Thomas, both of whom are openly gay, announced or felt that it was
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:04.440]   best to out Silicon Valley stalwarts who are also gay, but closeted, including Peter
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   Teal.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   And Peter didn't take...
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.400]   Well, that was over a decade ago because at the time, maybe even it's true today, I
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   wouldn't be surprised.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.840]   It'd be very hard to raise money in some areas like Saudi Arabia if you were known to be
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   gay.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:25.320]   And he took offense to that and then subsequently secretly funded Hulk Hogan and perhaps others
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   fight against Gawker, fight that Hulk won, although that will be appealed.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.640]   And it was enough to put Gawker out of business.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.040]   And while many journalists feel like, gosh, we really ought to defend the First Amendment,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.600]   actors say it couldn't happen at a nicer fellow.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800]   Where do you stand on a cashmere?
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.280]   What's your take on this?
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.600]   I think Peter Teal is far from the only Silicon Valley billionaire who hates Gawker.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.480]   I'm not that fond of them, to be honest.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.560]   I mean, during Valley Wags heyday, they went after a lot of billionaires.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.600]   Cheryl Sandberg at one point reportedly said that the person who wrote Valley Wags should
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   be shot.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.280]   So they're not beloved in Silicon Valley.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.000]   But I criticize Gawker a lot.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   I think they sometimes go too far in stories.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.320]   I thought the posting of the Hulk Hogan sex tape before we found out about Peter Teal's
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.680]   involvement was horrible and that they shouldn't have done it.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.120]   But I also think Gawker does really great, important, provocative reporting.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.240]   And they're always pushing the line.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.800]   And sometimes they go too far.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.920]   And I do think that they have done really good work over the years along with stuff that I
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   found questionable.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.920]   And if they do end up declaring bankruptcy and getting sold, Gawker itself might go
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   away.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.120]   The actual main property, covering media, but their blogs are going to stick around, gizmodo,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.800]   life hacker, dead spin, Jalopnik, they're such valuable properties.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.200]   They're going to keep doing what they do.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.160]   Maybe not quite as provocative as they have been in the past.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.080]   Gizmodo got a little trouble too with checkbook journalism, right?
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.120]   They bought the iPhone 4 when it was left behind in a bar.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   Yes.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.560]   And then Denton's never shown any reluctance to pay money for a scoop.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:24.560]   So I mean, which is a lot of journalists including myself, and I worked with TMZ.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.360]   So I worked with TMZ and his modos.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.040]   No, talking about.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.200]   I've been everywhere.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.280]   David, you were concerned that this is a Peter Thiel's actions have a chilling effect and
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   that you're worried about the next billionaire coming along and suing because of something
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   he doesn't like.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   Uh oh.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   David, you're muted.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   You're muted.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   I'm muted.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.280]   Yes, I'm unmuted.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.280]   I'm better now.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:57.920]   Some of today's billionaires, I think, are way more unhinged than the old ones used to be.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   I never lived in particular.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.680]   I never lived in particular fear of Bill Gates, although a Philippe Kahn certainly did for
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   years.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.240]   Uh I never thought that those people were going to come sue me.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.760]   But you know, in the info world, at the places that I worked, we never did any of the kinds
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   of things.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.240]   But we called names and we certainly made some of these folks pretty unhappy.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   You'll remember when uh she was used to run novel, now is executive chair at Google.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.800]   Uh, CNET put his home address and information like that that they got off of Google, they
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   published it and there was that big boycott.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.600]   That was a big deal, wasn't it?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   Yeah, it was a big deal.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.880]   But they said, hey look, we Googled it, Eric.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   This is public.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.560]   Eric Schmidt, you know, why are you so touchy?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   You know, you do this to us, you know, but you're a billionaire and therefore you're
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   much too big to have the truth.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.200]   But he didn't sue his, you know, he didn't sue them or fund secret lawsuits behind the
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   scenes against them.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.880]   No, they just boycotted CNET and eventually they kissed and made up.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   These things happen.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.120]   I remember on tech TV we were very concerned about showing how to hack the Xbox, the original
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.640]   Xbox when it came out because Microsoft was a big advertising.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.520]   But to their credit, this was when it was Ziff Davis, the management said, no, no, you
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.120]   go ahead and do your editorial job and we'll worry about the loss of advertising revenue.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.040]   And a lot of times these things, these boycotts don't last very long.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.960]   I know Microsoft has in the past boycotted PC magazine for a week.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.600]   A week.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.160]   Or whatever, you know.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   It's hard.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   Hardball.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.680]   Hey, well, it is actually could be significant loss of revenue.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.360]   But that was back during the day when the publishers and the vendors had significant
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:45.560]   ongoing relationships and there was some equality of terror between the two sides.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:52.120]   Once you have all of these little publications that are struggling to survive, even brand
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.600]   names that we know, they don't have any power.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.360]   You know, what I'd worry about is Apple.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   Now maybe less so now, but they put things secret out of business, sued them out of existence.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.320]   Under Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs was never reluctant to sue.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.040]   Steve Jobs wasn't reluctant to do much of anything.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   Steve Jobs put his mind to.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.720]   I mean, the concern is that like, you know, let's say, uh, in gadget or, you know, where
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.820]   I work right now or any other place, you know, they write an article that's, uh, then makes
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.580]   a billionaire angry.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.580]   They don't have to win.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.060]   They just have to keep.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.060]   That's the point.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.060]   Funding lawsuits.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.100]   And so, you know, it's the, it's the Scientology, you know, it's out of Scientology's playbook
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.960]   and the nineties where it's harassing them.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.100]   Yeah, they just, they would just sue you into oblivion.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   They didn't have to win.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.100]   Right.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.060]   They just had to tie up in court so you couldn't afford to do anything anymore.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.300]   They buy you in the real field.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.620]   You have the legal right to sue and the courts will decide if the first amendment trumps
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.940]   your right to privacy.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.700]   And I think that's all sensible.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.280]   But when you can sue and spend so much money on lawyers that it actually put somebody
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.740]   out of business before the judgment, that's another matter.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.500]   Yeah, that's the, I mean, and I think that's the concern for remember, Steve got the local
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.260]   police, the local constabulary to knock down Brian Lam's door.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.940]   No, it was Jason, Jason Chen's door and come and take all his stuff because he'd had the
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.940]   iPhone four.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.660]   He, Steve had no problem going to the local police and saying, Hey, you got to help me.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.700]   Actually, there was a task force, like some Silicon Valley investigative task force.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.060]   They went and the police were compliant.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.720]   I mean, they were doing what the exact way they have something that belongs to less than
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.400]   stolen as far as we're concerned, right?
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   And so the police right.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:34.000]   And there was a Borland incident much earlier than that in which executive leaves, Borland
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.240]   goes to work someplace else, lawsuits arrest warrants.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.400]   I think somebody got arrested as part of that.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.240]   And I don't want to say who because I'm a little foggy on who it was.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   But yeah, that was Philippe Kahn in Borland going after somebody.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.240]   There's a long tradition of this.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.740]   Yeah, it's a long and occasional tradition.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.740]   But it's usually from a company.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.740]   Right.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.740]   It's usually a company like a large company will sue you.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:04.180]   This is an individual who has a beef with a, with a, with a publication.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.980]   He is not in any respect illegal for what he did though, right?
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.380]   You can secretly fund.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.900]   Yeah, it looks like, I mean, I think Ocker, they're looking for some sort of legal way
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.540]   to sue him, you know, the countersuit or whatever.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.300]   I guess not countersuit because he didn't bring the lawsuit.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.340]   It doesn't seem like a, at least a tradition, if not a law that you should be able to face
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.560]   your accuser and a secret accuser funding secretly.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.080]   It doesn't feel like fair play exactly.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.000]   On the other hand, I'm so happy to see the guy.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.040]   Hey, it was a venture investment.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   That's right.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   It was an investment.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   Okay.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   He's an investment.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   And invest the ROI in that lawsuit.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.140]   And it's taking ROI on the lawsuit.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.480]   How much did he put in?
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.120]   What's $140 million plus smiting one's enemies?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.840]   What is a smite worth?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   A big bucks.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.560]   What is a smite worth?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   Spike big bucks.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:57.520]   I'll tell you, I pay almost unlimited funds for smiting some people.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.420]   WWDC and E3 start tomorrow.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.460]   Let's start with the WWDC apple.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:10.240]   I feel like Apple is struggling a little bit to reclaim the magic.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.360]   And now the latest is no new hardware will be announced.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   WWDC.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.880]   It'll be exactly what it supposed to be supposed to be entitled anyway, which is, hey, develop.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.880]   Here's the new OS 10.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.040]   Here's a new Mac or watch OS iOS.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.400]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   The end.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.840]   No, no virtual reality.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.360]   No new Mac books.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   Nothing.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.000]   Is there a risk if Apple does that that people will just go, Oh, God, they're so boring these
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   days.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I'm about to say that.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   They're so boring these days.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.800]   If they can fix Siri, or how about search an iOS?
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   If they had search in iOS is horrible.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.680]   You pull down like 50% of time.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   It's like nothing.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.280]   Go ahead and try to find an app on the app store.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.680]   If they can fix those things, I'm just, yeah, go.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.800]   Because they know that they're going to have their event in October or September for the
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   holiday season.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.520]   That's when all the stuff's going to appear and everyone's like, Oh, gah, gah, gah, I'm
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.240]   buying your phone, computer, so on and so forth.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.520]   And so, you know, they're, but they have to take care of, you know, their operating systems.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.660]   And no, this, I mean, that means like stepping back and really,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.400]   from, from hardware and just focusing on the software.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.560]   As a user, I'm happy.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   I think, you know, the, the, the, you know, people would be upset because they're not
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   going to hear about a new iPhone or Amazon Echo clone or some storage.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.360]   But, Cas, remember when you sit down at the editorial meeting being any of the day and
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.760]   you say, let's cover Apple and people go, what?
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320]   There's nothing going on there.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.280]   Ever since the encryption thing's over, it's been boring.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.480]   That's the, that's the Apple story right now.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.260]   That's so interesting is still the battle over encryption.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.580]   And so, you know, the big thing that they could announce that would be very exciting is after
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.940]   the whole debate with the government, they said that they were thinking about encrypting
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.620]   Apple iCloud by default, which is not encrypted now and is a way for the government to get
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.460]   in when it's on itself.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.460]   And messages, right?
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.940]   Messages have been, you know, oh, that's right.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.940]   Okay.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.940]   My messages have been encrypted for some time.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.900]   But iCloud, we know they, they will, it's encrypted.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:11.900]   I thought they, yeah.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.760]   But they will give the key to the government anytime they ask.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.800]   They can get into iCloud.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.440]   So that would be a big change.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.960]   But yeah, I mean.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   So encrypted.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:27.080]   Software, software is not quite as exciting as, you know, the newest, the newest iPhone.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   Well, there will be a new iPhone someday.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.280]   I'm a little, you know, we talk about this enough on Macbreak.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.720]   We don't need to talk about it here, but I just, I worry that Apple has lost interest
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.360]   in desktop computing.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.260]   They're sitting there with the MacBook Air.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.260]   It's working.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.260]   It hasn't been updated in years.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.620]   The Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013 and it wasn't very good to begin with.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.540]   And I just feel like they've kind of lost interest.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.660]   It's like, I mean, they make all the way.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.700]   They make so much money on those phones.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.300]   And I call we could make some computers too or we can make a lot more money with phones.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.540]   It's, you know, I, you know, I had like a brand new MacBook Air that does something magical.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.240]   OLED, an OLED function.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.640]   You bar maybe not that, but you know, does Apple really have anything new out on the horizon?
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.440]   As I remember, Steve Jobs was going to reinvent television.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   Yeah, that's over.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.600]   And when, and when, and when Steve died, you know, it was thought, well, they have maybe
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.040]   two years of pipeline there.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.440]   So I guess we're at the end of that pipeline because the watch was in the pipeline, I believe.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.720]   But then this leaves them with nothing declining revenue unless they can get into all kinds
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.840]   of new international markets for the phones.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.660]   Or not very much excitement for the phones.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.660]   But I think they did.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.940]   I mean, the China, they got the China bump is done.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.700]   They got the bump last year or the year before.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.340]   Now it's leveled off.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.300]   Well, there's the idea being reluctant to let iPhones in.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.540]   They may have, they may have shut their, their nickel on that in particular.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.920]   I don't know why they're all in on the car, right?
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.420]   I think there's still potential growth in China.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.820]   I mean, China's huge.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.780]   You know, and as that company, as that country gets, you know, richer really on the sound
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.220]   of citizen level, you know, that's going to be a lot more.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.300]   They have some serious competition from some very.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.060]   Chinese companies like Huawei and Xiaomi.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   I love Xiaomi.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   They do great stuff.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.060]   I love that phone.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.060]   Do you have a Xiaomi?
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   I have a Xiaomi.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   You have a note for?
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   You have a note.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   Yeah, I love that phone.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.060]   And where'd you get it?
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.660]   Mr. Xiaomi, it's in your same Xiaomi.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.660]   That's great.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.660]   Good luck getting one.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.660]   Sorry.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.660]   They're not selling the United States.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.740]   And everybody's waiting to see if they're going to, of course, Hugo Barra has the team
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   now.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   He was Google.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.820]   I mean, that's, it's my favorite.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.820]   Wow.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820]   Well, not my favorite.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.100]   I mean, my iPhone is my favorite phone, but it's my favorite Android.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.820]   You're one of those hipsters to say, oh, yeah, I had it first.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.300]   If you could only have my phone, you would love it.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.300]   But you can.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   Oh, it's a show.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   What do you use?
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   I had a note before you.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.940]   A Xiaomi Mi Note.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.940]   What?
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.940]   Too many.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.580]   I have to say, I have to admit too many names in technology these days sound like you're
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.100]   talking baby talk.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.100]   It does.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.100]   Google and Xiaomi.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.140]   You run out of words.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.140]   You run out of words.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.140]   They're all out of words.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.660]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.660]   We come back.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:27.780]   We got talk about Phil Schiller Revit revamping the, I don't care about that, the App Store.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.340]   Major iTunes overhaul.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.340]   Who cares?
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.540]   Well, iTunes, they need it.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   If anything needs to be fixed, it's iTunes.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.700]   I've written like five articles over the course of my career saying, okay, please fix
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.340]   iTunes for the love of God, please fix iTunes.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.500]   And it's supposedly a Microsoft word of Apple supposedly this week.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.660]   We will be covering that live.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.660]   We do our usual kind of mystery science theater 3000 coverage of the keynote 10 AM tomorrow.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.660]   Pacific time.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.660]   That's 1 p.m.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.940]   Eastern 1700 UTC be my Annie and not com.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.380]   Megan Moroni and me will be doing that.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.820]   And then we'll of course talk more about it on Tuesday with my break.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.940]   We are show today brought to you by, by Razor Harry's.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940]   It's Father's Day.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.460]   You know, I, if you got a Father's Day gift for your dad or your grad, because we got
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.500]   graduations going on right now, man, I recommend this is the Harry's Father's Day kit.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.860]   We've talked about Harry's before.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:27.620]   Harry's kind of is reinventing the razor industry by buying the factory in Germany and then selling
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.620]   them direct to you.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.860]   They deliver to you in a subscription.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.140]   So you're always got fresh blades, but you always have to start with the Harry's kit.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.340]   And look at this is really nice for dad.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.860]   I really like this.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.900]   You get the, this is a new handle for them.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.140]   It's kind of a soft touch black handle.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.220]   You get the course three blades with the kit and they have a new blade carrier that's
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.020]   kind of designed for a travel.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.740]   They've got the travel cover.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.140]   This is the stand for the razor.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.140]   I love this.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.620]   You get this engraved for dad too, if you want.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.180]   Like you're a swell dad and you put that on the counter there like that.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:09.140]   And then dad gets his choice or you get your choice for dad of the Harry's gel and it's
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.780]   a full size or the Harry's cream.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   This is what I use.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.020]   I really like it.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.100]   It's a sleek giftable box and you can add the engraving.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.540]   You can add a personalized card.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.220]   I got a personalized card that says to tweet from Harry's.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220]   It's arrived.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.060]   The dad that appreciates aesthetic and function is handsome set.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.220]   Includes everything he needs.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.740]   And it came from 5 9 9 0 3 star 1 1 star 0017.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.540]   Thank you 5 9 9 0 3.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.540]   Appreciate that.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   Those nice thoughts.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.860]   $40 but we're going to show you how to save a little bit and this giftable set will
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.340]   get your dad started with Harry's.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.980]   If you've not used Harry's you've got a, you've got a triumph.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.940]   Harry's got a great blade at about half the price of which you pay in the grocery store
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.020]   or the, or the, or the drug store where they lock them up behind plexiglass.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.900]   Why pay 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades when you can get them for half the price?
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.820]   And they're great blades from harries.com.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.940]   Now with their iOS app it's easy to order and easy to renew.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.740]   Just four taps of the mouse.

[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.820]   We are talking the week's tech news.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:45.420]   David Corsi, my old friend is here from decades gone by and great to have you.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.700]   I don't understand how I could not have ever had you on this show before but you.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.420]   I'm glad we got together.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.780]   It's, it has been a while but I'm happy to be here and I shave just before this show.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   You look good.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.020]   With a hairy, with a Harry's razor that I did not immediately fall in love with but
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.220]   on about the fourth shave.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.740]   I decided that it worked really well and I liked it.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.980]   Took you four shaves.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.940]   Well, yeah, I was using these very expensive blood glands.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.540]   No, I never cut myself with the caries.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.540]   It's really good.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.420]   I don't cut myself either.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.980]   It just took and maybe was the balance but it's a great razor and great blades.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.380]   It took me about three tries and now I bought more and that's what I use.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.380]   I love it.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.380]   Me too.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.380]   Me too.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.180]   And I also use square space if you want to let me do another.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.180]   Yeah, they're coming up.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.180]   Stand by.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.980]   We got the square space.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   Good.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.980]   Just around the car.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   Not a requirement, David.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   You have to understand.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.220]   You'll come back even if you don't help me with the ad.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.220]   That's okay.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.540]   I am happy to help you with the square space.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.980]   I think this is bizarre.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.180]   Apple is according to Bloomberg getting its new radio chips.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.300]   Not from Qualcomm but from Intel?
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   I thought Intel was getting out of the mobile business until late off.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.540]   12,000 was planning to lay off 12,000 people.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.540]   Cut out its projects for mobile phones.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.740]   Mobile phone chipsets but apparently I guess they still make the radio phones and they're
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.740]   going to sell them.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.740]   What is the question?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.740]   Isn't the question?
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.740]   How big is the order?
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.620]   Well, Apple likes to second source, I'm sure, because you don't want to be beholden to
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.620]   any one company.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.980]   Seven, who's going to say no to Apple's?
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980]   Seven.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.380]   Potentially ordering a zillion of these things.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.940]   I mean, it's really interesting to watch these Star Wars Intel of all people struggle
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.540]   in the new world, you know, and find it hard.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   Nobody's buying apparently.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.220]   Nobody's buying PCs and they're finding it hard to make their way in the new mobile
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.100]   world because they never did get a mobile processor going.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.620]   Well, they got it going but it was like four or five years too late.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.580]   And then the first phone they put it in was just horrible.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.580]   The scale process.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.820]   So somebody said that that was really Intel made a strategic error 10 years.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   It was a huge error.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.460]   I was going after that Apple iPhone.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.660]   I think I myself and another journalist almost made the person who was running Intel
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.500]   mobile cry at a dinner once.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   What'd you do?
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   We just kept asking them questions.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   Like why?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   What did you do?
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   What was wrong?
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   Why did you?
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   Why did you?
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.980]   And he's like, no, we just kept like, you know, that's what we were there for.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980]   We're journalists.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.420]   We're there to ask questions and he cried.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.980]   I feel bad a little bit but not really because my job and you know, they should expect that
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.900]   when I'm around, I suppose.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.900]   I don't know.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   That's why no one likes you.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.900]   That's why no one likes me.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.900]   This is the only place I'm welcome.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.900]   You're among friends.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.700]   The other visitors.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.340]   Apple Bloomberg says Apple will use the Intel chips in the AT&T, I guess GSM phones, but
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.580]   not on the Verizon chip.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.820]   So this will be Qualcomm.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.820]   That makes sense.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.860]   And if they're going to do it on AT&T phones, they'll do it on their unlocked and their
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.980]   T mobile phones as well as their GSM.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.220]   And I would guess the spirit would also use the Qualcomm chips.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.980]   Qualcomm owns this market.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.180]   iPhone sold in China, according to Bloomberg, will also be on the Qualcomm chips.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.900]   Apple has not commented on this.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.860]   But that's, you know, it's a little bright, little tiny bright spot in what looks, must
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:15.460]   look very grim to Intel as the future goes mobile and Intel does not.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:21.260]   It's not like AMD's knocking them out of the park either though.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.300]   All right.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.660]   Didn't spur any great discussion here.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.660]   We'll move on.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.900]   Hey, I have a Broadcom story about Internet of Things whenever you're ready.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.900]   Is that about I mean hack?
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:39.380]   No, this was a presentation I went to with a vendor and there was a press conference event
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.380]   probably four or five months ago.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.780]   And the presenter is talking about all the wonderful things that the Internet of Things
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.700]   is going to do in agriculture.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.140]   And it's, you know, it's going to tell you what you need to spray, where you need to
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.660]   spray, what you need to do, what you, you know, and he's talking about all the great
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.940]   opportunities there and how many jobs are going to be created.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.060]   And I call her the guy after the thing and I say, what do you mean?
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.820]   One guy could run a hundred farms sitting in a control room, God only knows where.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.460]   And he says, but what about all the development?
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.820]   I said, how many times do you have to develop this stuff?
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.300]   You know, once the Internet of Things is basically built and you have the big data analytics
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.940]   built, how many employees does that take going forward?
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.220]   So when people tell you that the Internet of Things is going to create lots and lots of
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.460]   jobs, I just look at this and say, yeah, at the end of the Internet of Things, it's the
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.620]   Internet of no jobs.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.140]   It's happened already.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.860]   It's continuing to happen.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.220]   And there's no reason to believe that the Internet of Things is somehow going to make
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.860]   everything okay for the jobless.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.940]   There are going to be three people with jobs who are going to be, you know, the super,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.820]   the bill joys of the world, the bill gates of the world, those kinds of people will have
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:05.420]   jobs and, you know, us mere plebeians will be here wondering, you know, where all the
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.740]   work went while they still expect us to buy their stuff.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.220]   That's the really rich part of it.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220]   This will be the guy.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:16.780]   I worked on a school farm for a few summers and I still had to be the guy to go out and
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.940]   fix everything that broke, like the water lines and everything.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.580]   So there's no one that guy's going to have a job.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.740]   Those aren't the best jobs.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   No, they're not.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   It was a horrible job.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.740]   We had it.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.340]   It's a good job when you're like in high school, yeah, or if you like dirt.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.340]   If you like dirt animals.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.340]   Oh, we know technology will not work perfectly.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.060]   I don't think they'll ever be a time when there's only one person who can run it all.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.300]   And then they always will get our universal basic income, you know, that they're experimenting.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   Oh, that right.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   Yeah, sure.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.220]   Those people will become security researchers because the Internet of Things is just a big
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.220]   mess.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.940]   They're going to be the people who patch all the holes.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.820]   There will be lots of security jobs.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.580]   Isn't that the challenge though for my kids who are in college?
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:01.740]   If you're in college right now, trying to map out where the jobs will and won't be is
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.380]   quite a challenge.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   Who knows?
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   Who knows?
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.620]   It's going to be a billionaire and sue company and sue us all by a billionaire.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.620]   That's good.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.980]   Well, even as car mechanic.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:18.620]   Even lawyers, we had a guy on, actually, a father and son team had just written a book
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.780]   about the future of professional jobs.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.060]   And they said, don't assume that machine intelligence can't also do a lot of the jobs
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.020]   that lawyers and doctors do better.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.220]   The last job AI is going to take is this job developing.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.460]   The one we're doing right now is going to be like, can it never be a developers?
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.100]   There will always be room for pundits.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.300]   I already have their their Watson lawyer, Ross.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   Ross.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.220]   I don't know why they've done it.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.820]   They have he married to Rachel on a break.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.420]   It's not a very lawyerly name.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.380]   They named it Ross.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.260]   And yeah, it's the.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.660]   They are there aren't any pundits anymore.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.460]   Oh, no, don't tell me that.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   This is the last bastion of the pundit.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.460]   Hold on.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.460]   I used to be a real pundit.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.500]   I'm not a real pundit anymore.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.580]   So and who else Esther Dyson?
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.580]   Do you see her?
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.580]   We're pundits.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.300]   Aren't we pundificating right now?
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.860]   We're what's left.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.860]   You're right.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.860]   They're right.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.220]   Stuart can't even buy a Tesla anymore.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   It's just sad.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.820]   Yeah, it's it's not what it used to be for being a pundit.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.220]   I'm getting all my talking points from Siri right now.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.700]   We had an interview yesterday on the new screen savers with the robot ROW bot.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.020]   This is a farming robot.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.460]   It isn't in mass production yet.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.980]   But yeah, it goes.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.860]   It's thin enough to go down the corn rose and do things like spread pesticide right now.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.140]   They're using it for fertilizer.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.220]   And the other thing it can do that you don't normally do when you're growing corn.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.220]   I learned a lot about corn yesterday.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.620]   Is before you know, you want to the promise you once you harvest the corn, all the top
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.860]   so will blow away or wash away.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.700]   So you have to put some sort of ground cover in and promises too late after you've you've
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.380]   harvested the corn, then the rain's coming and you can't.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.820]   So the robot will go in and will seed ground cover before you harvest the corn.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.820]   It goes under the.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.620]   Oh, that's very cute little thing.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.620]   That's pretty cool.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   No, what?
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.620]   A row.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.620]   A corn row.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   Bot.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.620]   Get it.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   Row.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.620]   Row.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.620]   Spot.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.620]   It's actually really really cute.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.620]   That's a really big robot for going through corn rose.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.860]   I mean, they're about to make it smaller.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   Right.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.860]   No, that's the size.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.860]   It's only a few feet wide.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   That's the key.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.860]   Right.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.860]   Maybe it's just the scales making.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.860]   Yeah, I bring.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.860]   No, it's not.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.860]   It's not very big.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.820]   Have you ever actually walked through a corn field?
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.820]   It's hard.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.220]   It's yeah, it's not like like rose or not.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.220]   It's not rose like you think.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   They're just like corn.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.520]   You've got to come up next October.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.020]   We have a corn maze here in Petalum.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.020]   It's quite famous.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.020]   Oh, corn.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.860]   This is every website now have to look just like that one.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.820]   Yeah, this is what is that look called?
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.180]   There's a look for this where it says scroll up, scroll up, scroll up.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.180]   Infants.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.100]   Quiet on whatever with the box around it and the circular headshots.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   Is this like what?
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.340]   It's the 2016 cool or what is that?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.340]   Look, I don't.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.700]   Two years from now, it'll be something else.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.220]   Square space actually has a circle.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.780]   Square space has a template for this actually, believe it or not.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.740]   They have a new, they have new templates that because look, this is one of the reasons
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.300]   you don't maybe they'll always be a job for a web designer.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.740]   There should always be a job for any designer because there's fashions change.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.020]   You want your stuff to stick out and if it all looks the same, you don't know.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.020]   Circle.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.020]   Circle.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.020]   Circle.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.220]   All right.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.820]   We'll go, we'll wade right into the controversy.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:57.380]   Video posted on YouTube 300,000 views, 15 million views on Facebook.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:05.140]   It's from a group called source fed asserting that the Google auto complete suppresses negative
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.260]   searches about Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:15.380]   If somebody types Hillary Clinton, CRI, Google does not complete it with crimes, but crime
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.020]   reform, crisis and others.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.380]   This is Matt Lieberman.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.580]   Now Google immediately weighed in on this one.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.780]   Matt cuts even our good friend at Google said, that's ridiculous.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:34.940]   If you do, if you do the same thing with Donald Trump cry, it won't get crimes because we intentionally
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.700]   don't surface.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.660]   We don't auto complete that kind of negative stuff.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:45.260]   They got a lot of trouble in the past for kind of auto suggesting negatives about people.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.220]   Trump says it's a disgrace that Google would manipulate its searches.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.860]   Very, very dishonest.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.220]   They should let it float and see how crooked she really is.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.180]   Matt cut says it's just false.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.740]   And by the way, if you do Hillary CRI or Hillary in, you'll see it in Hillary and diamond,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.620]   Hillary and diamond news.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.740]   The best part about the video because we that's certainly, you know, we, we're going things
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.740]   are happening.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.740]   We check them out on Engadget and you're watching the video and as they're typing out Clinton
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.220]   or Hillary, the third auto complete is email, which is.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.940]   That's a crime.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.500]   That's one of them.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.940]   And the video kept just kept showing that.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.940]   I'm like, I.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.200]   It's a lot of what a lot of what you see in these kind of viral things is just stuff that
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.740]   confirms what you believe, right?
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.740]   That's why they go viral.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.900]   You know, they don't go viral because it's oh, shocking.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   They go viral because it's yeah, see, I told you, I'm going to share this with all my friends.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.900]   I guess there isn't any.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   I don't know.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:49.100]   Anybody want to want to go to bat for a source fed or apparently not.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.100]   Okay.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.740]   You've got the wrong panel for that.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.740]   I got the wrong.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.740]   I don't know.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.220]   I thought David might, but maybe not.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.700]   I could if you wanted me to know.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.700]   You're being way too agreeable.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700]   Stop it.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.500]   I'm happy to help the program.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   Whatever you need.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   I want to have a fight.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   I don't want to have a fight.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   The average.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.700]   Well, I am agreeing outraged.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.940]   He is actually.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.940]   We hold on.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940]   Hold on.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   How could a man with a dog?
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.940]   Outrage.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.940]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.420]   This is scruffy.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.620]   How could I be outraged?
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.740]   Where did you come up with that name scruffy?
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.940]   The people who found him roaming the streets of stocks and describe him as looking scruffy.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.940]   Guess what?
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.940]   They're right.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   Scruffy.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   Scruffy.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   Scruffy.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.580]   Scruffy is looking nefarious and well.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.580]   I send you Harry's kit for scruffy.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.580]   Oh, he doesn't.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.580]   He doesn't.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.580]   He doesn't.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.580]   He doesn't.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.580]   He doesn't.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:50.140]   Would somebody defend for me Google tango because it does not seem very compelling or interesting.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:58.420]   You can make 3D models of your friends and watch the videos and it was kind of depressing
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.700]   to me because it was instead of looking at the stars, you could put your phone up, point
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.380]   them at the sky and see it in your phone.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.900]   Well, we can't see the stars anymore.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.900]   Then you see the...
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   That's true.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   60% of America can't see stars.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.900]   Because of pollution.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.900]   That's all we got.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.900]   All we got is tango.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.900]   All we got.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   That's really depressing.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.980]   It's the thing with wild animals so you can see wild animals that are 50, 60 miles away.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.420]   Like, "Oh, there's a deer."
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.140]   Instead of building a domino...
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.820]   What do they call that?
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.980]   A domino cascade thing.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   You could...
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.220]   You just could use it, do it on your phone.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   Your phone will do it for you.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.500]   You could just look at it.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.980]   That's my table.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.140]   But the phone is superimposed at dominoes.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   Can somebody explain why this was in any way an exciting thing?
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.980]   It just does not get me.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   It's hard.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.980]   I had nothing else.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   They had nothing else.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   It's all I got.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:53.260]   When I have my own show that's called Technology Sucks, that's kind of the thing that's going
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.460]   through everything we talk about today.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.500]   That's not very good.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.820]   Apple's tired.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.260]   Would you want one of those telephones whose names we can't pronounce?
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:09.540]   Billionaires who seem a little different than the rest of us more than their bank accounts.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.540]   Phones you don't want.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.540]   I mean, Apple hits the skids.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.260]   I'm a cheerleader for technology.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.420]   I love technology.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.660]   But at the same time, when it does suck, which it does more often than not, frankly.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:29.620]   I mean, Apple is just like, at their event tomorrow, they will announce like 10, 15 new
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.300]   features for, let's say, iOS.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.260]   By the end of the year, when you're actually using it, you'll use maybe one of those.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   Maybe two.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.860]   I think about the other features you'll touch, which I get sucked into the reality of the
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   distortion.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.460]   I feel I was very excited about 3D touch.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   The idea.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.460]   You...
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.700]   Oh, in hindsight, I was an idiot.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   But you look...
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.580]   Oh, you press hard on this and then it will show additional choices.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.260]   It'll pop up a menu of possible.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.980]   The first user interface improvement in iOS since folders.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.020]   The only one since folders, I think.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.740]   In hindsight, not that cool.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.740]   It gets in the way for me is...
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:17.020]   See, I waited for a long time to buy my six and really got it when I guess the five that
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.180]   I had finally died, died, died.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.380]   It was cracked on both sides, etc, etc.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.620]   Couldn't be fixed.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:28.460]   So I went out and bought a six, which dutifully now has a cracked screen right about here.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.580]   This is not the only allowed to own a phone, my friend.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.860]   Well, I've broken lots of phones and I'm a good friend.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:42.300]   It's the guy who fixes my screens.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.180]   That's actually a story.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.300]   The right to repair.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.260]   But I look at what they say for the iPhone 7 and I say, "Well, I have a 24 month AT&T
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.860]   replacement.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.700]   I guess I'll take it when I can get it."
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   Huh?
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.700]   You know, it's just like...
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   Well, you're not part of...
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   You're not one of us.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.260]   You're not one of those people's got to get lost.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:10.580]   I still have the very first iPhone and I have stood in line for hours to get iPhones.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.580]   Oh.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.580]   I am one of you.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   Okay, you are one of us.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.380]   I just have grown up.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:21.100]   So there's a battle and Apple is, by the way, leading this battle against the right to
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.260]   repair.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.380]   You know what the right to repair is?
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.940]   And it comes up at first, I guess, the John Deere tractors that you're not allowed to
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:34.740]   fix because they've got DRM on the software and the tractors.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.140]   They don't want anybody to steal it.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.740]   But it also comes up in the independent repair shops and Apple really doesn't want these
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.660]   iPhone independent repair shops.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:49.620]   There's a bill in California being proposed the right to repair act that would give independent
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.380]   phone repair shops the manuals and the information and the parts they need.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.140]   Apple does not want to give it to them.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.780]   Now on the one hand, Apple says, "Well, you don't...
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.300]   But the problem is these guys are no good and they're going to do a terrible job and
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.140]   you really should use us."
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.780]   But on their hand, I think David, you have the right to bring that phone to a third party
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.780]   and get it fixed.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.420]   It's a lot cheaper.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.940]   Obviously, although I then don't get a refurb phone as the replacement.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.860]   I get my phone with the screen, which is kind of nice.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.020]   I don't have to go back and rebuild my phone.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.060]   I mean, that's a good thing.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.860]   But yeah, I ought to be able to get my phone repaired.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:32.380]   But if you're Apple and you're control freaks and this is your cash cow in ways you can't
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.980]   even describe to people how much money they are paying you, of course they're going to
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.780]   want to do all the fixes.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   Of course they do.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.980]   They want to build phone company wars.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.820]   Like there's a famous lawsuit when after...
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.940]   Yeah, the privacy protection, like cone that you added to the phone and they actually
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.940]   sued them for making an attachment for the phone, the right to repair really reminds
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   me of that old battle, which was thankfully eventually...
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940]   You won that one.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940]   But they won...
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.580]   But that was a similar argument too.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.540]   My bell said, "Well, if we allow anybody to put any old equipment on our network, we
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.940]   can't guarantee the reliability of the network."
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:16.420]   Well, with that, that was a battle for the heart and soul of universal service is what
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.980]   Carter phone was.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.700]   I mean, that's what that was about.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.500]   It wasn't about, "Can you do this?"
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.540]   It's that you were renting all your equipment.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.100]   The economics of mobbell was set up in a certain way.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:35.020]   We finally came to a point where all of the money that mobbell was making, some of which
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.260]   went to fund the National Geographic Society, by the way, suddenly there was this...
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.300]   Well, now they've got Rupert.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   They don't need to mobbell money.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.700]   Yeah, there was this pause between the revenue that they were getting from business and universal
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.780]   service, installing lots of phones.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.420]   And that's where the MCI decision came in.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.500]   And that's what opened up competition, ultimately killed the bell system.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.060]   And I will tell you, I think it would be better off today if we still had the bell system,
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.540]   where four guys could get around a table in a room and say, "We're going to do fiber
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.900]   to the home."
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.380]   And it would just happen.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.380]   I kind of liked that world.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.380]   I liked the bell system.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.380]   I'm not sure I agree.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.660]   I have some mixed feelings.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:17.180]   If you are in Southern California and you got your Verizon Fios replaced by Frontier, which
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:22.780]   happened just a couple of weeks ago, people are furious.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:26.300]   The Frontier has done a terrible job of replacing Verizon.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   I guess you're saying though, if we're AT&T, if we're all mobbell, we wouldn't have fiber.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.300]   We wouldn't have fiber.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   We'd be doing DSL.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   Yeah, we would.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.260]   Are we doing one megabit DSL?
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.260]   We wouldn't have fiber.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.260]   Why would they give us fiber?
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.260]   They wouldn't have to.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.260]   Of course.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.260]   Hold on.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.260]   They didn't want us to have the internet.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.260]   They wanted us to stay on the phone.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.260]   Hold on.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.340]   The reason they would give it to you is their rate of return was entirely based on their
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.740]   investment.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   The more money they spent, the more money they made.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.140]   I was there when they were experimenting with broadband fiber by transmitting uncompressed
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:04.380]   television up at HomeDell at the now-empty Bell Labs.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.060]   Yeah, they made money by investing more and more and more money.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.180]   The regulations were that if you spend more, you can make more.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.180]   That's the- Yes.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   Interesting.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.180]   Yes.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.900]   So they would have had every reason to bring us fiber to your bathroom, whatever-
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.260]   Or cones of silence that you could put on your phone.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.420]   Well, again, whatever.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.260]   I don't think you get innovation from monopolies that are protected by government regulations.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.260]   We got- Hold on.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.380]   They invented stereo.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.860]   They invented- I mean, I can go through a list.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.460]   It takes a moment for me to pull it up.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.460]   Oh, you're right.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.740]   The Bell Labs and AT&T, they invented Unix for crying out loud.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.820]   They held back radio.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.060]   They held back- What?
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.700]   They held back radio.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   Did they?
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   They didn't hold back radio.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:57.620]   They were the lines, the WAEF decisions, and the chain broadcasting decisions back in
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.620]   the '20s and '30s.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   Wow.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:05.220]   I'm getting the history- Well, why wasn't AT&T at this point, like, be better?
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.180]   I mean, if they were broken up, why would they stop innovating?
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.420]   It's not AT&T anymore.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.940]   They got rid of Bell Labs.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.140]   They got rid- I mean, all of this corporate innovation that used to take place in this
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.060]   country is mostly gone today.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.580]   It's a very interesting point of view.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.060]   I hadn't really- There's nothing to support it.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.180]   You know, I spent a lot of time roaming Bell Labs.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:33.500]   I watched the Japanese tourists marvel at Thompson and Richie's desk where they invented
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   UNIX.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.820]   The Japanese people were taking pictures of it.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.820]   The desk.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.820]   The empty desk.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   The desk, two of them.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.260]   But it was- That was an amazing place that invented amazing technologies.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:53.020]   And that's not happening here the way it used to because there is no return on investing
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.940]   in science just for the sake of science.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.940]   Wow.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.780]   This is a great conversation.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.460]   I have no information at all with which to counter you.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.300]   Kashmir, you sound like you know a little bit about this.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:19.100]   I mean, the whole argument of Tim Wu's "The Master Switch" is about monopolies using their
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:25.780]   power to hold back the development of other technologies, television, radio, phone and
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.020]   internet.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:32.300]   And so if you're convinced by Tim Wu's book, then you would not agree with David because
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:37.980]   there were many examples in there of technologies that were suppressed because it would create
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.460]   you know, another market that would compete with their market.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:46.620]   He in fact says that we're at that stage now with the internet where the big companies
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.100]   just as they did with long distance are going to come along and say, "Thank you very much
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.100]   for developing that.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.940]   We'll take it from here."
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:58.020]   And maybe you're seeing that with Comcast and I'm sorry, charter growing to such massive
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.780]   size.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.980]   We certainly have duopoly's and you know something like that.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:09.140]   RCA under David Sarnoff was a big suppressor of technology.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.980]   Which could be a little bit of what Kashmir is thinking of because they got the FM radio
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.060]   band moved.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.500]   Meaning that all the FM radios that had been sold by major Armstrong stopped working.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.740]   Suddenly they were in the Ham 6 meter band, I mean of all things.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.860]   And there were major fights like that.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:34.100]   And then the FCC, which tends to do okay on little things but messes up horribly on big
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:40.540]   things, there was an idea once to make your radio dial start at AM and channelize as you
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.780]   dialed up into FM.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.180]   So it would look like one radio dial to you.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.980]   No separate FM radios, no separate converters, push buttons would go wherever you wanted
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.660]   to go.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:58.420]   And that couldn't fly because it made FM too accessible and too competitive with AM which
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.100]   was dominant at the time.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.500]   But David long distance calls for instance pre-card or phone were extremely expensive.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.100]   I remember calling people up and saying, "Hey, I'm on long distance.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.540]   This has got to be quick."
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:13.940]   Now we essentially get unlimited calling within the United States for one flat rate.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.620]   Isn't that an improvement?
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.100]   I'm getting unlimited calling the internet.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.100]   Brought to us by competition.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.980]   I had an $800 phone call once, a phone bill once.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   Wow.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   I was right out of high school.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980]   I had a girlfriend to live three hours away.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.980]   Same thing for me, $1,500.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.980]   $800.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.340]   My mom, I'm like, "I need $800 from you right now."
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.380]   But that's changed right now.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.980]   That's not the inner, but I'm saying is competition seems to have helped in that case.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.660]   Well, you know, you can change the incentives.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:46.700]   What happened is, is we were no longer subsidizing building out this great network.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.500]   I would love to see another Bell Labs.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.300]   I would grant you that.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.500]   The innovation out of Bell Labs is huge.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   Long distance.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.940]   There are Google X and new Bell Labs.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   Maybe.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.940]   Maybe.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.260]   I mean, Google innovates for the sake of innovation for a lot of, I mean, cars, I mean,
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.980]   mostly for ad revenue, but they're still just make crazy ideas.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:13.980]   I don't think anyone at Google knows how to say no, but, yeah, we have cars.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.820]   Getting into phones, that idea was insane if you think about it.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.140]   Google is a place where you went and you searched for, you know, yourself really most of the
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.140]   time.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.020]   So David, Google is not Bell Labs.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.500]   There's nothing about Google that is Bell Labs.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   And if you had ever driven around--
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.180]   Do you think Bell Labs would still be doing what they're doing today in this sort of corporate
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.180]   atmosphere?
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.180]   I don't think so.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.820]   No, that's why they're not doing it anymore.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.420]   What I was going to say is the reason we had these huge long distance bills is because
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:48.420]   long distance was seen as a business service and it was expensive to provide at that time.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.220]   If you say you don't have to subsidize anything and you can build networks and charge for
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:58.820]   long distance based on what it costs, you end up with MCI in cheap long distance and
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.780]   the internet comes and, you know, wire line telephones go away.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:08.220]   I don't think that's such a good idea either, but that's just me in national security thinking.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.940]   So I'm not sure that everything that we've done, yes, it gets cheaper.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.260]   Yes, it gets cheaper.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.100]   Yes, it gets cheaper.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:20.420]   But what is the real cost of all of that cheaperness?
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   If you like that word.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.380]   It's cheaperness is good.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:30.580]   Look, there's no solution that is perfect.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.020]   You know, there's negatives and positives to both.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.580]   You got the Bell-- on the one hand, you got Bell Labs with this giant monopoly.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:43.540]   On the other hand, you have, frankly, an incumbent protecting their long distance tariffs because
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.980]   it's very profitable for them and less incentive for them to bring those prices down.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.700]   So I think that there's negatives on both sides.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:56.420]   I would come down in favor of a free market over a subsidized or regulated monopoly almost
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   every time though.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.220]   Wouldn't you, David?
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.900]   We have what amounts to monopolies.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:07.740]   I can get internet service here at my home office from one of two companies.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.220]   And it's basically the same offering.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.660]   No, and it's not working so good.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:16.220]   It's a duopoly created by the FCC after being strong armed by the cable companies, frankly,
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.660]   who said, well, we're not going to string cable unless you make it a monopoly.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:26.820]   If you're going to have a monopoly or a duopoly, you have to strongly regulate and make requirements
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.300]   that the companies do things.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.340]   Yeah, we kind of have the worst of both worlds, don't we?
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.340]   Yes, we did.
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.620]   Unwillingness to regulate it, but we've created it.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.620]   Yes.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:43.580]   So back to the secret war to keep you from repairing your iPhone.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.180]   This is the Huffington Post.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:51.220]   The company is repeated, Apple has repeatedly opposed legislation that would allow people
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.900]   to go to third party repair companies.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.500]   And Apple, I think, has a rationale.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:02.620]   It makes a little bit of sense, which is, well, we can only guarantee the quality if we do
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.020]   it ourselves.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.260]   And we don't want to repair and we won't repair something that somebody else has repaired
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.260]   first.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:12.460]   So if the minute you take it to a third party, we're done.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:18.140]   But I am in support of people like I Fix It, and I'm in support of the states, Minnesota,
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:23.500]   Nebraska, Massachusetts, and New York, who have considered adopting right to repair amendments,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:29.700]   which would force companies to give out the information needed to fix stuff.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.060]   Shouldn't Apple have, you know, I mean, car, you know, the same thing with the automobile
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.060]   these days.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.060]   I mean, if you buy--
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.060]   There's no shade tree mechanics anymore.
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.300]   If you buy a BMW, BMW is going to tell you, you know, bring it to the D&W dealership,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:46.100]   but you might have a mechanic that you've trusted, that you've worked with for years
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   with your other cars.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:51.300]   I'd take it to that person because the dealer's always going to be way more expensive.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.300]   Right.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.540]   And you're probably always going to be way more expensive than random person in the mall
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.980]   with the kiosk.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:02.260]   One of the reasons the state legislatures are arguing for the right to repair is also
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.260]   to-- because of this issue of the throwaway disposable economy that companies like Apple
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:13.860]   create, forcing people to buy new computers, new phones, because they're not repairable.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.580]   You can't-- you know, you can't just easily swap out the battery.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:22.580]   If it dies, you've got to throw it out or take it to Apple for a very expensive repair.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.660]   Where do you stand?
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.660]   What do you think?
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.300]   Cashmere, right to repair?
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.660]   I mean, it's hard not to be pro-consumer.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:37.580]   It does seem like people should have an option to get their phone repaired wherever they
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.580]   want to have it repaired.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.580]   So--
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:44.300]   It's one of the reasons I think Apple's really pushing this robot that recycles iPhones
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   and--
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:53.100]   They want to look like they're really pro-recycling because it does look like really they're pro-waste,
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.100]   pro-e-waste.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:57.100]   It's the March of Technology.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:01.020]   Everyone who makes any sort of product wants you to buy that product again--
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.020]   Again and again.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.020]   --a little bit better.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.460]   And how else are we going to grow the market, right?
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.460]   Slightly better this time.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.460]   Now we've got--
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   Can you tell me a bit better?
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.100]   You can push it a little harder and then it'll pop down.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.740]   Contextual manual up here.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.060]   Oh, let's see.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060]   God, now I'm depressed.
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.180]   It's like you kind of nailed it, David.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.180]   All this stuff sucks.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:25.020]   This is why it doesn't have you on the show, David.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.020]   You're never coming back.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.020]   It's depressing.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.020]   You bring me down.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.420]   I want to get you a cheerleader.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.500]   How about the new Moto Z?
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.500]   It's exciting.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.900]   It's got modular backs with magnets.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   I don't want a regular cell phone.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   Technology is incremental.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:47.940]   Put it under this lens and we're looking at the very incremental change.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.780]   And when technology is most inspiring is a longer product cycle.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   It's very rare that we get this.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.780]   No.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.780]   And you're like we got some bloopers about--
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   Oh, no.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.780]   --and they're trying to make flying cars.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.780]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   And I read that article and I go, yeah.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.780]   Sure, Larry.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:03.780]   Flying cars.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.420]   You weren't even impressed by that.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.100]   No, because it's ridiculous.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:11.100]   You don't want every Joe Schmo to be in the air flying around.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.100]   You know what I'm flying cars?
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.100]   It's called a helicopter.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.100]   And we've had those for years.
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.100]   Yeah, but they were really expensive.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.100]   Thank God.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.100]   Yeah, I don't want--
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.580]   Because if everybody could afford one, imagine.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.340]   I can barely-- I barely deal with people who are driving on the road right now.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.820]   I don't want to miss a guy falling into my house.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.140]   Let's play Ask the Old Guys for just a second.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:35.340]   I remember back when I started as InfoWorld back before Kashmir was born probably that
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:40.460]   every day was pretty exciting because big things were happening.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.980]   Things that you'd never seen before, things that really made a difference in people's
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.500]   lives were happening.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.340]   That doesn't happen that way.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.340]   Sure it does.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.340]   No, it does.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.340]   Autonomous vehicles are-- I think autonomous vehicles are going to be a massive change.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.340]   Right, real cars.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:58.340]   SpaceX.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.340]   SpaceX.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.340]   You know, the idea that there could be commercial space travel.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.340]   That's pretty cool.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   Flying cars not so much.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.340]   Autonomous cars.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.580]   That's a huge de-autonomous flying cars is the only way you could do.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.660]   Yeah, well, there's little drones.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.500]   Autonomous vehicles are going to be-- when they finally hit the market, that's going to be
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.500]   an--
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.300]   I'm going to be thinking that's what Larry is.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.900]   Because there's so many people, especially with the-- people getting older like David.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.300]   You know, at some point, you're not going to be able to drive, but you're going to want
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.300]   to go to the store.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.300]   You're going to want to go to--
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   I can't wait.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   Check out Bell Labs again.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.300]   You should be considered--
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.300]   Let's go look at that and see.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.860]   You can just get in the car and it takes you somewhere.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.020]   My grandmother never had that.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.380]   My mom might not even have that.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.380]   No.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.620]   But when I get older and I can't see and I shouldn't be behind the wheel, I'm going to
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.220]   be able to just get in the car and it takes me to some point.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.220]   David, your hands--
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.220]   I get out.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.220]   I get out.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.220]   It's about to explode.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:50.060]   But we talk about this and all this science stuff that previously no computer publication
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.620]   would have ever spoken about.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.860]   Because it was too blue sky.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.340]   No, we have nothing else interesting to talk about.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.340]   Right.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.340]   Right.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   How about this?
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   Lenovo is going to do bendy phones.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.340]   Whoa.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.340]   Come on.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.340]   This is good stuff.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.340]   Look at that.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.340]   My--
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.340]   My balloon.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.660]   I think that's a piece of rubber they're using to demonstrate the concept.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.660]   How long have we seen the bendy screen?
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   Does anybody want this?
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.660]   This is five, six years.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   What is the market for this?
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.700]   It's been a long time.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.940]   People who like to keep their phone in their back pocket.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.940]   Obviously.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.940]   There you go.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.940]   I want to be able to sit on my phone.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:26.940]   No.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   It's not so much bendy.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   I just want it to be soft and comfortable.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.220]   David, soon you'll be able to be in your autonomous car wearing your oculus rift and
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.140]   then playing around for your bendable phone.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.740]   And then you can just appreciate the world again.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.140]   I'm going to take a break and let's talk about VR.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.140]   Oh, yes.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.940]   Because now-- I mean, I was very excited.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.620]   We got the rift and we got the vibe.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.300]   And I was all excited and I'm playing with it.
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:51.620]   And now I'm starting to think maybe this isn't-- this is like 3D TV.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.780]   This is not a non-starter.
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.060]   Your opinions will come in a moment.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.060]   Think.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.460]   Think about what you think about this.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.100]   But first, ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about audiobooks.
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.620]   Now, this is an innovation.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.620]   But it's been around for a while.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.700]   In fact, I joined Audible.com in the year two.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.260]   2000.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:11.940]   And man was I happy because I had a long commute to San Francisco every day.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:18.660]   And the idea of sitting in a car for two hours listening to pop music on the radio was--
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:20.860]   I was about to blow my brains out.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:26.580]   Then Apple invented the iPod and Audible came along and suddenly, life is good.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.100]   I've read more books on Audible.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.700]   My library on Audible now is 300 or 400 books.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.140]   It's awesome.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.620]   And I get more every month because I'm an Audible subscriber.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.620]   You want to try Audible?
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.100]   Go to Audible.com.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.220]   We're going to get you a deal.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.900]   Two books free.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.580]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.300]   That's what I have, which is two books a month.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.140]   It's the best deal, absolutely.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.660]   You'll also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times you get
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.020]   to pick.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.700]   And then, John, by the way, the Tim Wu's book, The Kill Switch, that's on Audible.com.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:04.140]   I listen to a lot of industry history and biography on Audible.com, but a great fiction
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.740]   as well.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.260]   Two books await you.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.260]   That's not it.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260]   That's the show.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.740]   There, not Tucker Wayne.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.860]   Boy, there's a few kill switches.
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.860]   Keep going.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.020]   The master switch.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:20.620]   That's why the kill switch though, that looks like an interesting seven hole genre.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.100]   The master switch.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.100]   Tim Wu, thank you.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.100]   You're Audible.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.100]   There you go.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.100]   The rise of fall.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.700]   That actually is a great must read book.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.860]   But here's the deal.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   You're going to get two books free.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:36.940]   So there's one, but maybe, I don't know, maybe you want to read a little fiction, maybe a
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:41.900]   thriller like The Kill Switch or you get to pick.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.900]   Two books await you.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.100]   Audible.com/twit, two.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:49.340]   Audible.com/twit and the number two.
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   That's two credits.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.340]   Most books are one credit.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.220]   There are a few longer books like Game of Thrones.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.580]   It's two credits, so you could just use it for the Game of Thrones book.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   And you'll finish that some year.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:02.100]   Oh, look at Jerry Purnell, The Moten Gods Eye.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.100]   Love that.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.460]   What a great book that is.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.980]   Our friend John Hodgman's more information than you require.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   He reads it.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   It's wonderful.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.940]   Right now I'm listening to the confidence game.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.540]   This is a triangulation interview we did with Maria Konokova.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.540]   It's fascinating.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:21.420]   It's about the history of con artists and how they have found a fertile field in the
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.300]   Internet era.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:29.420]   And if you're interested in why we fall for this every time, this was a great book.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   I'm listening to it right now.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.140]   Listen to it on the way in.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.860]   Audible.com/twit, two, two free books await.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.900]   Take advantage of that offer right now.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.980]   We had a great week this week on Twit.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.980]   And I think we've made a little mini movie.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.420]   You ready with that mini movie, Brian, to show you what you might have missed.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   Previously on Twit.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:54.500]   Riley, who is a viewer of our show, sent us this video of what he does when no one's
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.700]   keeping him busy.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.820]   Do your friend's iPhone and fire up Siri.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:03.540]   From now on, call me a giant pile of...and then hit yes.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   Giant pile of f***.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.540]   I like that.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.540]   You're Riley.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.300]   But since we're friends, I get to call you giant pile of f***.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300]   Ah!
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   Twit Live specials.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.940]   Augmented reality on your phone.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.540]   The future of wearables and Motorola.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:25.620]   I'm Father Robert Bellisser, the digital Jesuit for Twit TV here at Lenovo TechWorld 2016.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:35.140]   What about a screen that won't break?
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.580]   Security now.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:44.980]   What I keep seeing is Windows 10 people saying that Windows 10 is more secure.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.740]   Security features does not mean more secure, it actually means less secure.
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.500]   At least initially, new code has bugs.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.460]   And it takes time to find them and remove them.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.460]   Twit.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.020]   Now, where'd I put my iPhone?
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.380]   I hope you enjoyed that.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.460]   You saw Ashton Kutcher drop his phone?
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.900]   Yeah, that was at Lenovo World.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.900]   What happened?
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   I didn't see that.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   Um...
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.220]   They had him on like a scaffolding of some sort.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.580]   He was supposed to drop his phone onto a bit of metal.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.180]   And he missed the show.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.060]   And it was just the whole event was very awkward.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.700]   It was just like, he just kind of came out.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.860]   He didn't seem like he wanted to be there.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:27.140]   When he was by himself on stage and he did his little presentation, he did a really good
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.340]   job, because he did that jobs movie.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.660]   Um, he knew how to do.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.300]   But then when the CEO was up there and they were talking and he was...
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.300]   There wasn't like a cue, I guess, for him to leave, so he was just sort of standing there.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.300]   Oh, God.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   And then he was...
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.300]   It's wandered off.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   It's just we've been...
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.300]   I'm gonna get off it.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.300]   I'm gonna put it over.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.300]   He missed.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.300]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.300]   He missed.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   And then when the guest speaker had called him to come out, he took like, I don't know,
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.060]   probably a minute and a half to come out.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   It felt like forever.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   I was like, "I think I can hear Ashton clambering up the ladder."
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   That's terrible.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.060]   And then what...
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.620]   I went to Lenovo.com and they have a picture of a guy with a hay bale on his head.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.980]   What is going on at Lenovo?
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.460]   What is that?
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.260]   Hold on.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   What is that?
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   I don't understand.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   Why is there a guy with a hay bale?
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.260]   Hey, for his head.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.900]   Is that innovation?
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.420]   Innovation never stands still.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:23.140]   Anyway, if you want to watch the video of Ashton Kutcher and the phone, the keynote's
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.220]   there, but we also have our own coverage of it.
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.900]   I do want to talk about the Moto X or Moto Z.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:35.020]   I retweeted my gift that I made of Ashton just being awkward and walking off stage.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.140]   You should work at Buzzfeed.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.140]   That's good.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.140]   That's good stuff.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   Making gifts.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   Great week ahead.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.540]   I'm sure it's a great week ahead.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.820]   We get WWDC and E3, Jason Howell, TNT.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.820]   What's coming up?
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.820]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.100]   Here's a look at a few things we're going to be following closely in the week ahead.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.780]   First off, as you probably know, Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.460]   tomorrow and, well, you're going to be on set along with Meghan and Andy and Notco
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.660]   to cover the keynote live.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.580]   10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.940]   Pretty sure there'll be plenty to discuss throughout next week from that event.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:15.060]   Also, the E3 gaming expo begins on Tuesday, June 14th, lasting through the rest of the
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.060]   week.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.180]   Possible new hardware from Microsoft.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.900]   Maybe even Sony, although they say don't expect the Neo, but regardless, plenty to
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:27.100]   discuss next week and we'll have a team there doing on-site coverage as well.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.100]   So look for that.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:32.020]   June 14th is the VR unveiling of the OnePlus 3.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.660]   Leaks reveal, I think, a sharp looking device.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.460]   This will be the first time a OnePlus phone won't require an invite in order to buy.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.060]   So you better get your wallets ready.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:46.340]   The Bluetooth 5 spec is actually set to be announced on Thursday, June 16th.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.980]   It should bring double the range and four times the speed of Bluetooth 4.2.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.260]   So Bluetooth fans, there you go.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.900]   And I'm sure we'll dig up plenty more other things to talk about.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.500]   We usually do find Meghan Moroni and myself talking tech every weekday at 4 PM Pacific,
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.580]   7 PM Eastern 12 AM UTC at twit.tv/live.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.300]   That's a look at the busy week ahead.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.300]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.300]   Nice.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.300]   Very nice.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.100]   Thank you, Jason Howell.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:17.540]   Roberto made, here's Roberto's, wait, we got to get to the beginning of it.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.540]   Hold on a second.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.540]   So this is Ashton Kutcher.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.540]   That's all right.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.460]   Ashton Kutcher awkwardly leaving the stage.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.620]   I guess I'm done.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.620]   Oh, that's horrible.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.220]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:40.140]   If you want to see it yourself, if you're listening, STRNGWYS is strange ways without
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.140]   the vowels is Robertis.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   That's true.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.780]   By the way, I just see here right below it, one of your band is playing in a Prince
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   tribute show on July.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.780]   We are.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.780]   July 8th.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.780]   We need one of your bands.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   How many bands do you have?
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.780]   I'm three.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.780]   What?
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.420]   Well, I have a regular band.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420]   What do you do?
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420]   Are you the lead singer?
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.300]   I look, you kind of look like you be.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.460]   This is a regular band.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.460]   A regular band.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.620]   Will you sing something for us?
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.020]   Oh, I guess I've never heard him sing.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.020]   I would like to.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.020]   No, that's awkward.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.100]   Come on, sing something.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   That's the regular band.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.020]   And then I keep creating these like super bands with all these...
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.020]   Super bands?
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.180]   With all these members of other bands in the area.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.180]   Other world famous...
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.740]   Other world famous like in San Francisco.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.740]   Cool.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.740]   San Francisco.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.900]   What's the name of your Diga-Boom?
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.740]   The regular band is North American Scum.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.740]   North American Scum.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.780]   The band we're doing, the Prince Tribute, is called Controversy.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   Nice.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780]   I have no idea.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.460]   How do you have fine time to do that?
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.460]   I don't.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.460]   It's...
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.420]   No, once a week and you...
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.420]   You just go and you play.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.020]   I don't play video games.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.980]   I don't have a lot of other...
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.100]   Yeah, I asked Kevin Kelly the same thing.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.100]   He said, "I don't watch TV."
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.900]   And I thought, "That's just not a price I'm willing to pay."
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.900]   No, I watch TV.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.900]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.380]   Because TV you just sit there with my wife and I can watch it.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.380]   And if it's good, we can pay attention.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.380]   If it's not, we can tweet.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.380]   We can tweet.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.380]   Send funny pages.
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.100]   Thank God for the Twitter.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.100]   What would you do with bad TV shows?
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.100]   This one is gonna sound.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.340]   Now I've forgotten what we were gonna talk about.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:13.140]   That's Roberta Baldwin from Engadget, also with us Cashmere Hill from Fusion.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:18.060]   And she's @cashhill, K-A-S-H Hill on the Twitter.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:23.020]   And my old buddy, David Corsi, who is @techinsider on the Twitter.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.700]   If only I ever used that account.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.700]   Do you never...
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.020]   You said you also were ready.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.380]   You're gonna get a tech blog all set up and you just didn't even remember.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.380]   Yeah, we're gonna get that guy.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.700]   I was gonna do it to do something about this show.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.700]   But I...
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:34.700]   Well, what will they...
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.700]   Can we talk about?
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.780]   People will watch this show months from now.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.380]   So what would the...
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.780]   And so when they do, they can go there because it'll be done by then, I hope.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   Yes.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.140]   Where would they go?
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.100]   I'll probably put it at Corsi.com.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.220]   That's not what's there now, but that's probably where I'll put it.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.220]   Okay.
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.220]   CO-U-R-S-E.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.940]   100,000 sites on the internet.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.940]   Really?
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940]   I am reminded.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.420]   When did you register that?
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.940]   I'd have to look, but I'm also one of the first 10,000 on LinkedIn.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:08.300]   You know, I had Corsi on MS on Hotmail for a long time.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.220]   You know, if you were there kind of at the beginning, you could get...
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.740]   Hey, corsi.com, how did I get that?
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.300]   I was, you know, first in line.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   Try...
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.460]   I used to have...
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.780]   That sticker that said top 5% of the internet.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   Who was that?
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.780]   Was that one of the, like, excite or somebody or anything?
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.580]   He used to have that on my site.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:38.100]   And Gadget has leaked pictures of a new Xbox that we expect to see announced at E3 this
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.900]   week.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.340]   What is Microsoft's press conference?
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.660]   Is it tonight or is it tomorrow?
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.100]   It's tomorrow morning.
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.180]   Usually they do it before the show begins.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.700]   I believe it's halfway through Apple's press event.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:57.100]   So Apple will start and then have a 3D and a 9D panel start because...
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.300]   Well, we'll be covering both, I guess.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.980]   The rumor is it's about, what, about a quarter or half the size?
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   Let's see.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.980]   It's a lot smaller.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.580]   It has 4K capability.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.580]   You can stand it on its side now.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.620]   Yeah, that's a hard cat for...
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   Because no one has...
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.980]   Everyone's like home entertainment system is...
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.980]   It's horizontal.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.980]   It's gone in a rack.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.220]   If it's on its side, my cat's just going to knock it over.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:28.860]   Video, a GAF, have members have posted images of what they're calling the Xbox One S. It's
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.260]   white, 40% smaller.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.860]   It's 40% small.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   Yeah, 40% small.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.660]   4K video, which is a big deal.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.420]   They didn't have very high quality video on the original Xbox One and a 2-terabyte hard
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.340]   drive.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   And...
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.500]   Power brick's internal.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.340]   The power brick, which is normally massive on an Xbox One.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340]   It's like this big.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.340]   It's like the size of a Fiat.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   It's huge.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.340]   It's a Fiat 500.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.340]   It's Fiat 500 size.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.340]   It's like two wires sticking out.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   Now it just goes in there.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   How does that...
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.340]   Have we made massive improvements to transform?
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.340]   And we were talking about...
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   You know what?
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.340]   We were talking about how there's nothing awesome in technology.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.140]   This is huge here.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.500]   And according to random people on the internet, we've been able to put a power brick inside
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.220]   of an Xbox.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:14.980]   I mean, the power brick is almost bigger than the Xbox that they're coming out with.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:15.980]   This is nice.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.980]   Good looking.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   Okay.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.900]   Sorry to make you laugh.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.140]   Right in the middle of your diet's snapples.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.500]   Is that the best stuff on Earth?
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   Just curious.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   Sure.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500]   Okay.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   It's like super low.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.100]   It's really the best stuff on Earth.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100]   It's delicious.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.020]   It's sort of the best stuff on Earth.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.820]   Pet PlayStation 4.5 also rumored to be coming out.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:42.700]   I don't know if Sony will announce anything at E3.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.060]   Although I'm excited about the PlayStation VR.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.940]   Got to play with that a little bit.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:52.460]   And of the three big players, that probably is going to be the biggest only because there's
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.460]   so many...
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:59.700]   It's like 40 million installed units of PlayStation 4s that can use this VR without a much higher
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   cost.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.140]   You don't have to go out and buy a whole new PC, for example.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   A beefy PC.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:10.180]   We built a $5,000 PC to use the Oculus Rift and the Vive.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:11.180]   And it's fun.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.180]   I have to admit.
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:16.820]   And actually, Brian, you tell me, Brian, our technical director today, are people going
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.180]   back there and playing that a lot of...
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:25.220]   After I leave, are people like spending a lot of time playing on the VR?
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.460]   Some people more than others.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.780]   I think a lot of people...
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.380]   Your brother loves the...
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.380]   The brush...
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   What is it?
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.380]   Tilt brush?
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.380]   Tilt brush by Google, I believe.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   It's a painting program.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   Him and Anthony have done some really cool stuff.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   They're both artists.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.420]   They are both artists and pretty talented.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.060]   How about the games?
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.820]   Are people like Gravitating?
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.940]   You showed me that one game where you get on the platform and you're shooting at the
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.940]   bad guys.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:48.940]   That was fun.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.780]   I think Burke really likes that one, but not a high recognition.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   What are you?
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780]   Tilt brush was cool.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780]   I want to play some games.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.780]   Okay.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:57.780]   Okay.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.780]   Tilt brush is cool.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.700]   But again, let me ask the question, are people spending hours in there using that stuff?
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.700]   No.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.860]   I think VR is one of those things.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.180]   It's kind of gimmicky.
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.540]   You play it for a little while, you go, "That's really neat."
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.540]   And then you don't.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.860]   It's not like you say, "Oh, I've got to do more of that."
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.820]   It's kind of like enough.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.220]   And I don't think the games library is really all there either.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.220]   Very, very weak.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.940]   How about putting in an old fashioned pinball machine?
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:26.940]   Wait, I know.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.940]   People don't.
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.940]   We had one of those and we had to get it.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.340]   No, we had one and it would.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]   Nobody played it.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   Aw, I would have liked it every day.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.660]   I'd be here way more often.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.980]   You say that, but I think you wouldn't.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.980]   Yes, Trevor.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.980]   Thank you, Morleo.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.060]   Well, it's too late.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.500]   We gave it away.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.980]   Some guy was here and I said, "You want it?"
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:46.980]   He said, "Yes."
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:47.980]   Really?
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:48.980]   He said, "Really?
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.980]   Bring a truck."
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:51.980]   Damn it.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   Do you know what used pinball machines are selling for?
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   Don't tell me.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.980]   Don't tell me.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   Oh, no.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   This was...
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.980]   This was...
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.980]   This was Jerry Ellsworth who's a big...
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   You don't want to.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.300]   Not too much fanatic made this and gave it to us.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.980]   And we just have nowhere to put it in the new studio.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:04.980]   Really?
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.980]   They're worth a lot of money.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.980]   Yes.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   I can go to Alameda.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.980]   They have the pinball museum there.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.980]   I really am never coming back on this show.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:15.980]   I can know.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   What if you could be the ball in a VR?
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   And you're bouncing around, you're zooming, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   You're getting nauseous.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.980]   You're going off.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.980]   It's probably not the best.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.980]   Be the ball.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.980]   And then God does the flippers.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   It's like life.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.980]   Right.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   You don't do the flippers.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   You're the ball.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.980]   It's a whole new way of looking at pinball.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.980]   Well, I mean, what do you want to see in VR?
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.980]   Because I can't figure out anything in VR that excites me.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.980]   The examples people give is, and even Samsung gives is,
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.980]   your friends are all in Paris.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.980]   They're stuck at home.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   And they put on their...
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.980]   You put on your VR helmet.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.980]   They put up their camera and they go, "Raberta, we're all in Paris together."
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:01.980]   No, no.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.980]   I've heard people who really like us.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.980]   The VR porn.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.980]   I've heard that too.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.980]   It wasn't for me.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.980]   I don't know.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   I can't do that at the studio.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.980]   Maybe that's why nobody's using it.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.980]   Here's the pinball machine though.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:15.980]   That's not the one, isn't it?
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   No, it's the same.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]   Oh, it is the same.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   Wow.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.980]   I mean, this isn't the one that Jerry built.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:22.980]   No, but it's the same game.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.980]   That's a nice game.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:25.980]   $3,000.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.980]   Pinball machines, yeah.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:27.980]   Damn.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.980]   Nice pinball machine.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.980]   Look at that.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.980]   It was an old one.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:31.980]   It was classic.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   It wasn't one of the big P.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.980]   Oh, those are even better.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.980]   Classic ones are worth more.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:37.980]   Classic ones are being rebuilt.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.980]   NPR did a feature.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.980]   It must be true.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:42.980]   If NPR...
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:43.980]   Money.
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.980]   I want David on every show.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.980]   It must be true.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   How does she know about VR porn?
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.980]   I've been looking and I couldn't find it.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.980]   Oh, it's easy.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.980]   Really?
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.980]   I'll need it.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.980]   We'll talk after the show then.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:55.980]   Okay.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.980]   I'll tell you about it because I happen to have tried it.
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:58.980]   Because we...
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   Like, Dad.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.980]   Because I am a father and I need to know about these things.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.980]   Also, it's your job.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:03.980]   That's my job.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.980]   As a journalist, you have to explore...
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.980]   Again, in other regions of...
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.980]   When I first experienced it, I thought, "This is revolutionary.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   This is going to change the world.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.980]   Porn will never be the same."
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   And then since then, it hasn't really.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.980]   Well, the one I tried is, you know, the local San Francisco porn studio, kink.com.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   So they, you know, were one of the first studios to jump on VR.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.980]   So I was watching this VR porn that was, you know, they're basically BDSM.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.980]   Right.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.980]   So this is one of those...
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.980]   They're kink.com and gives you some idea.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   This is one of the porn videos where the person enjoys being insulted.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:45.980]   So I had...
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.980]   So do you get to be the person being insulted?
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:49.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   So two people in front of me that were making out and the woman was telling me I had like
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   a very small penis basically.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.980]   Oh.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   So it wasn't really my usual cup of tea.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.980]   Where else could you experience that?
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.980]   But they say they're a very devoted fan too.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   So it gives me a new respect for performers because you do get the...
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   A lot of these are shot in, as yours was, first person where you're the performer in it.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   Right.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.980]   And then the stuff is being done around you and to you.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   And so it gives you a new respect for the performer and what they have to put up with.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   I actually watched them film one of their videos.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.980]   And it's a lot...
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.980]   It's more work for them in a way because they...
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:35.980]   It's work.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.980]   They have the cameras all over the place.
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.980]   They're trying to get the lights exactly right.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:42.980]   I wouldn't want to do it.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:46.980]   And I have to think for the performers, they're going to be having all the angles.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   So I think it's a little bit more nerve-wracking for them.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   It's all the fun...
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   They want like a helmet of some sort of...
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   No, they probably just have a camera on their head, right?
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.980]   The camera's not on their body.
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.980]   Well, this one was kind of like a scene from afar.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.980]   No, but if you were doing it with the current crop of cameras, you'd have a giant...
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:07.980]   Like a halo.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.980]   Halo around you.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:11.980]   So the...
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:16.980]   Although one thing I did notice, the ones I've looked at weren't 360 degrees.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.980]   They were kind of constrained angles.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.980]   And that was the other thing is I found myself like kind of...
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.980]   They're fooling around in front of me, but I'm more...
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.980]   Like, let's look at the decor.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:28.980]   Oh, look.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.980]   [laughter]
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:31.980]   Oh, that's it.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   It's like they've said about porn for years.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.980]   For the first five minutes, you don't think you can get enough.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.980]   And after minute number six, you don't care if you ever see it again.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   That's VR in a nutshell.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.980]   That's VR in a nutshell.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   That's exactly it.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.980]   We are shopping in VR porn.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:47.980]   He's like, "Look at this.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:48.980]   Can you consider that?"
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   I can't.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.980]   It's like, "Oh, let me see what books they have on them."
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   I'm trying to read the titles on the bookshelf.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Oh, zoom in.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   It's more voyeur.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   It's voyeur.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.980]   But that's the thing is you can kind of...
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   So what is interesting about immersive video, 360 degree video in VR is you choose what you're looking at.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.980]   So it is kind of interesting that way.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   There's a Cirque du Soleil demo that comes on the gear VR, the Samsung gear VR,
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.980]   where the performers all around you and you can...
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.980]   That's frightening.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.980]   It's a little weird, but it's kind of interesting because you can watch that trick.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.980]   Or that trick.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   And so what's unusual is you are controlling the point of view, which makes it difficult from an artistic point of view as an artist because normally what an artist does is tell you what to look at.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.980]   That's kind of the art of film.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   And that's gone because you could be shagging right in front of somebody and he's looking at your bookshelf.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   Yeah, but you can also be on your training bike riding the Tour de France.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.980]   That might be better.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:53.980]   For de France, much more realistically than you can with the current simulators.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   When you start talking about you're there, you're looking around, you're seeing the wonderful sunflowers by the side of the road and all of that.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   That would be kind of fun.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:09.980]   So I can imagine that there are some experiences that you might want to have and guide yourself through.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:10.980]   I like that.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:14.980]   Well, Air and Space Smithsonian, if you can't be there, you ought to see it.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.980]   Better for experiences than storytelling.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.980]   I think that that's that would be my point.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.980]   Yes.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   It's hard to get to.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   Now for $10, you could get a VR tour of Mount Vernon and you could use it for a whole year, bring your kids vacation at places that you're really going to see something.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.980]   It's not like I need to experience the Great White Shark 30 feet out in the water.
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:37.980]   It's Santa Cruz.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:42.980]   I want to be in a museum.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:49.980]   At your house looking at all the technology, old stuff that you have on your shelves, like I have on my shelves, that would be interesting.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   But this, I want to play a game in VR.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.980]   I don't want to play a game in VR.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.980]   I want to have a conversation with you in VR.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.980]   This is all I need.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.980]   We don't even use phones.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.980]   We just text each other.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.980]   Why would I want?
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   I know that's...
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:07.980]   As soon as you have the ways like this much, I'm like, "Oh yeah, this is great.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.980]   Oh man, my face is so sweaty.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:10.980]   Now I have zits.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.980]   We all, we're all going to have zits around our forehead."
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:14.980]   Oh, I know what he's been doing.
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.980]   It's been a lot of time in VR porn.
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.980]   We're teenagers.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   We already had problems.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.980]   Cashmere will not have rings of zits.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   I am going to stand up for the other remote guests today.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   She will not have rings of zits.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:32.980]   She has great teeth, a nice smile that I envy.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   I don't have a good toothy grin.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.980]   She will not get zits.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   You and I will get zits.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:38.980]   She will not get zits.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   I'm getting zits.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   I'm just sitting here.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:41.980]   I did this.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:42.980]   And I'm going to have like five zits.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.980]   It's beauty in three beasts is what you're saying this show is.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.980]   I wouldn't go that.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:48.980]   It's our new band.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:49.980]   Do you want to create any three beasts?
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:50.980]   Media in the three beasts.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.980]   That's pretty much every band.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.980]   That's really the story of bands, isn't it?
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   There's the person in front and the rest of them.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:01.980]   Okay.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.980]   So the super flexible phone you wear like a watch non starter.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.980]   Maybe there's some value in VR if we get the right content.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   That's what one of the reasons it's hard to judge this stuff is you.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:13.980]   It's so early.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   It's early.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:16.980]   I mean they finally have the technology to make it.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   Now you need somebody to actually make an experience that is more than just running around and shooting people.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   Or shooting aliens or whatever.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   Or we've got a lot of like, oh, let's do an interview with somebody.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   But in 360, I'm like, why?
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.980]   That person sitting right there, you're interviewing him.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.980]   I don't need to see the people behind him.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   We're just throwing things out of wall and hoping something sticks.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.980]   And hopefully someone will come up with something cool.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   But for now, I'm not really a gamer.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   So it's not my dream.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.980]   I like to play games.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.980]   But it's sometimes it's too immersive.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.980]   You're really in there and it makes you queasy.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.980]   I'll be honest with you, it's hard not to get queasy on these things.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:53.980]   Now stop it.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:57.980]   I look like Yule Gibbons playing a video game in this thing.
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:58.980]   This is just the worst.
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.980]   This is me in the PlayStation VR.
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:01.980]   And I don't.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.980]   I wore suspenders so I wouldn't look like I was hit.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:05.980]   Or with it.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:06.980]   Did you do this at any point?
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.980]   I do.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   I think I do.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:09.980]   You have to do that.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.980]   And you thought what you need is a VR set to be in front of.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   Like all these local news teams around the area.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:18.980]   So I figured that out.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:22.100]   Sitting in front of green screen, you know, you could have the coolest set and it could
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.660]   change every week.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.420]   So one of the challenges with VR is how do you show it?
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:30.860]   And so what we do have is in the other room, we have a giant green screen stage.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.780]   And that's where we set up the VR.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   And then you see the person and everybody looks dorky when they're doing VR.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.100]   You just cannot help it.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.620]   But at least behind them at a full size, you see the environment that they're in.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.540]   And actually it's a pretty, I think that's the way to demo VR.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.980]   We figured that much out anyway.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:47.980]   I suppose it's just, yeah.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.980]   There you go.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:53.220]   So now this is actually Kate Patel on my old screen savers friend.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.220]   And then she's in the tilt.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.540]   That's the tilt brush game, the painting game.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.180]   And that must be thrilling to do.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.980]   I can hardly just contain myself, me and the dogs you're watching this.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:08.140]   It's kind of, but I want to screen grab of me and the dog just so that I can.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.140]   Okay.
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.140]   Just to prove that you were on this show.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.500]   I'm going to use it on Facebook is my problem.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.780]   You have once had you on a show.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.780]   Yes.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   Yes.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.100]   20 years from now say, see, you really were on a show even though you don't remember it.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.100]   And scruffy too.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.940]   And then for some reason you stopped answering our calls.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:27.420]   I mean, yeah.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:28.420]   Okay.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:35.340]   So somebody in the chat room while I was doing the radio show gave me the website, have
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.500]   I been pwned.com.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:43.340]   You know that there have been some massive lately leaks of databases.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.020]   You put in your email address has been around for a while.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:51.900]   We've used it before to see if your emails showed up in any of these pwned databases.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.900]   Totally pwned.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.740]   Oh, I'm I've been totally pwned.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.660]   The breaches I was just say everyone's pwned and still be correct.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.420]   I mean, they don't really have to do anything.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.780]   All this means is that your email address showed up.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.700]   Not maybe not even your accurate password or credit card.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:11.340]   They don't tell you that just that your email address for in my case for Adobe linked
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.940]   in my space in Tumblr.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.820]   But this is the numbers that blew my mind.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:22.740]   The top 10 breaches my space breach 359 million my space accounts.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.380]   I still have an account.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.980]   That was the thing that I did is I logged in.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:28.940]   I said, Oh, I still have an account logged in with your password.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:35.940]   And I changed the password immediately linked in 164 million accounts, Adobe 150 2 million.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:41.300]   The size of these database dumps are I mean, actually Madison was only a million.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.900]   Your year 30 million accounts.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:47.940]   Well, I mean, that's the problem with sites like MySpace where we signed up for something,
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.460]   you know, five, 10 years ago.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.820]   And maybe it's changed hands a few times.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.540]   And the people who own it now, maybe their security is lax.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.940]   And you keep using that same password.
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:58.940]   Right.
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:01.700]   You're like, Oh, I've been using this password for 10 years because the name of my dog and
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.820]   the street I lived on and, you know, my favorite football team.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:09.620]   And then suddenly now your current Twitter account is hacked or worse your email accounts
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.620]   are hacked.
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:18.500]   All of the problems with technology generally and also with capitalism is you can't move
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.780]   backwards.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:25.180]   Once television killed radio in the United States, it wasn't allowed to do that in the
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.140]   UK.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:32.180]   We couldn't ever go back and have good radio again with this technology in the internet.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:37.500]   If we had to invent the internet today, it would look nothing like when it was invented
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:43.380]   with no idea of what it would become, no idea, no security, no this, no that.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:48.780]   So we're constantly playing catch up and we don't have the ability to say stop, you
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.820]   know, beginning tomorrow, there is a new internet that is new and it is secure and it
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:54.860]   is whatever.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:59.540]   We could build that internet, but there is no way to do the transition to it.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.540]   Unfortunately.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:03.740]   Do you want to be my, my space friend, Roberta?
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   All right.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.020]   I give you guys my space account.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.580]   You want to be my top eight?
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.580]   You know who else?
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.580]   That's Tom.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.580]   He's my space friend.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:18.660]   Oh, what does, what does Germany most in this most recent round of passwords that got
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:23.620]   hacked the, the, the LinkedIn 2013 hack that just seems to be kind of like coming out now
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:29.460]   and then the Twitter hack is the, the people that weren't using two factor like this is
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.180]   the news security solution we've come up with, right?
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.060]   Because we know the passwords are not secure.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.060]   They get out all the time.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:40.820]   So you have a second factor that you have sent to your phone and that becomes more secure.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:46.260]   But in this most recent hack to, to Dorei McKesson, the Black, Black Lives Matter activist was
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:51.060]   hacked and he actually had two factor turned on for Twitter and his email account and the
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:58.300]   hackers went to Verizon and got them to change his SIM card so that the two factor messages
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.020]   that were coming from Twitter, for example, went to their phone instead of his.
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.060]   And it was just such a deep hack and that's so hard to protect yourself against that, especially
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.980]   because social engineering always works.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.180]   So you can call the phone company and you can get them to believe anything, especially
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.060]   if you have the sound of a, you know, crying baby playing from a YouTube video.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:20.740]   So that's what's terrifying to me is that you, you can take all the measures and then
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.500]   still get hacked.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:27.980]   So Dorei tweeted at 1031 someone called Verizon impersonating me and successfully changed
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.620]   my SIM unsuccessfully attempt to change my phone number.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:36.460]   What they're trying to do of course is get that second factor authentication sent to
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:39.420]   their phones instead of his phones.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.180]   I'm not clear though.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:43.900]   He says, he says, Verizon says we're investigating.
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:44.900]   We're not.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:50.220]   But they say by changing my phone, sim the high hacker bypass to factor verification,
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:56.020]   which I have on all accounts, I'm not sure I buy that because if they weren't able to
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:01.820]   get his phone number for their phone, how would changing his sim change to factor?
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.060]   Would they have that, if they have that sim, they can just have it put that sim in a phone
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.900]   and suddenly every text message that he gets goes to that.
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.260]   They have to get his physical sim though to do that or convince Verizon to say, oh,
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.780]   this is my new number.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:17.220]   Or my new, this is my new phone.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.700]   And to your new sim, you just changed the code of your sim and tell them that this sim
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.980]   is actually that's easy to do.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.420]   I've done that when you get a new phone.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.420]   That's what you do.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.420]   Exactly.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.740]   And if you get a new sim burner and there it goes.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.900]   Yeah, you don't even need that.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:36.300]   You can order a sim from Verizon when it comes, you call up and say, hey, I got my new phone.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.140]   This is the new sim ID.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.140]   Please make this with the phone.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.780]   Oh, geez.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.140]   I saw a talk with Kevin Metnick about a year ago.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:50.140]   And you know, he has a company, I'm just using Anthosick.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.620]   He has a company that goes in and checks the security of other companies.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.180]   And someone asked him, how often can you break into it?
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.620]   He's like, well, if we're not allowed to use social engineering, I think it was like
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:01.620]   60, 70%.
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.620]   He's like, if we are 100%.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.740]   Yeah, Kevin wrote the book on social engineering.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.900]   So yeah, it's 100%.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.780]   And then that's how Matt Hone was hacked.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.300]   That's how I learned how to hack my own accounts.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.380]   It wasn't as Matt was hacked.
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:17.220]   And we had to do all the research about it.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:21.260]   And we would just call and pretend, you know, whatever we could find the internet about
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.860]   ourselves, we would tell them.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860]   And then we could change.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.860]   That's all you need.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   Cashier wasn't that your colleague?
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   Was it Alexis?
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.460]   Who was your colleague that hired two firms to hack him?
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460]   That was Kevin Roos.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   Kevin Roos, that's right.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.060]   He had he invited two hackers to go at him with everything they could.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.540]   That was crazy talk.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:44.060]   But one of the firms was a social engineering firm specifically.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.180]   One of them was a more traditional hacking firm.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.180]   Both of them pwned him.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.180]   And it's pretty easy.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.780]   I mean, the same thing happened to him where they called his film provider.
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:58.180]   That's why actually whenever I screenshot my phone, I try to crop out who my provider
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.180]   is.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.620]   And I tell other people to do this because, you know, once they have that information,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.860]   then they can call and try to impersonate you.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.500]   And usually the only kind of information they need to get in or the last.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.300]   Your social security number.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.620]   How would they get that?
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.220]   How do they get the last four?
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.860]   Because once you have the last four, everything.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.860]   You can pay $5.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.860]   You get any one social security number online.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   What?
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.540]   You've never done a Lexus Nexus search of somebody.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:24.740]   Lexus Nexus.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.460]   I thought that was a law database.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:31.420]   There are many places through which social security numbers run.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:36.300]   Maybe you could do a Lexus Nexus search on Leo Laporta and you would get my social.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.380]   There's probably some already.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:39.420]   There's probably some portion of it.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.660]   Do you have your Lexus Nexus there right now?
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.380]   You want me to look up your social security.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.860]   Why not?
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.340]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.180]   I think technically that is an issue of the database.
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.660]   But I'm not, but I'm invite.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:55.660]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.660]   But yeah.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:57.900]   I'm inviting you to do so.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.900]   There are various ways that it is very easy to look at people's social security numbers.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.300]   And it doesn't need to be the whole number.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.060]   That's the point that all the phone company ever asks you for is the last four years.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.060]   That's not yours.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.060]   Are you looking me up?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.900]   No, I don't think you can Google my social security.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.900]   That's that one.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.500]   I'm finding other people named Leo Laporta who has their social number.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.380]   And you can find other sites that are dedicated to the access of the next social security
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.380]   search.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.380]   Justin Bieber is so scared.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.820]   You can do person searches.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:25.820]   You can do person searches.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:26.820]   OK.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:30.180]   That's how, like, usually how news organizations get somebody's phone number.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.180]   Right.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:32.180]   Because they have personal person records.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:38.020]   But yeah, so the social engineer called his provider and she played a YouTube video.
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.260]   Of a baby crying.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.260]   Oh my God.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.260]   It was so funny.
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:42.260]   And it worked.
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:43.260]   She said, "Oh, it worked."
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:49.540]   My husband's out of town and I desperately need to get into his phone for some reason.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:51.980]   Kevin's not even married, so.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:58.820]   But the point is that customer service rep, their job is customer service.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:04.020]   The problem is that authentication techniques are so poor they want to serve the customer.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:08.380]   So all you have to do is somehow assert that you're the customer and they'll serve you.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.380]   Birthdays.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.980]   You want to make customers happy.
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.980]   Your mother's date name.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:14.980]   Which you can basically find through.
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:18.260]   Go into Facebook and seeing which woman posts the most on this person's date.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:22.060]   Everybody knows my mother's maiden name is McGillicuddy in the last four of my social
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.100]   are four seven nine two.
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.020]   Now some people know that.
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.020]   What are you doing?
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.780]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
