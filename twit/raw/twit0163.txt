[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Splash blog.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I use that from now on.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Who needs a splash when you got a splash?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Speaking of splashes, the wonderful Veronica Belmont is also here, the host of
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Tekzilla and Core Q-O-R-E on the PlayStation 3 network.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   For the awhile.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yeah, it's been a long time.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We're glad we can get you back on.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Happy to be here.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Also here, you're -- unless you're sick of them, in which case I can dump them,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Patrick Norton, your co-host on Tekzilla.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Patrick's treating you good, right?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, of course.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yes.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's good to have you both on.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's a little mini Tekzilla.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And also a special guest on the show today via phone from his home in some
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   undisclosed location.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's Kevin Mitnick.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Of course, we gave out his phone number earlier and I apologize for that.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Hey Kevin.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Hey Leo, how are you?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's really good to talk to you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Kevin Mitnick is a good friend of the show.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   In fact, it was after your jail time that you did for hacking some years ago.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We got you on the screen savers.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Your first appearance -- well, first of all, your first appearance had a jail.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But then after that, your first time on the Internet when you're probationed.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And that was cool.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I remember that like it was yesterday.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And Waz gave you a notebook computer.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You still have that MacBook?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I don't use it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The new MacBook Pro, and I understand this month they're going to announce even a
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   newer MacBook.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I don't think it's been announced yet, but I'm excited.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We'd like to keep up to date with the newest technology.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And your security firm, you can go to Kevin Mitnick.com or Mitnick -- what is the --
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Mitnick security.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Mitnick security.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And that's what you're doing these days is consulting on security.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, pretty much traveling the world, speaking at, you know, still doing the same old,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   same old speaking, doing a lot of pen testing, security assessments.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   But a cool thing you might not know of is I just was commissioned in July by Little Brown
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   to do my life story.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So I'm working on the new book and, you know, the true story of Kevin Mitnick.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Very cool.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Two books written already about your exploits, but to hear it from you will be very interesting.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, I think I'll have a different viewpoint.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Well, I know you -- we talked the other day about -- I know there's one you don't like,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   one it's okay with you, but this one will be your official biography.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It won't be ready for like a year.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And then of course the editors will probably take another few months, but I'm excited to
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   finally be able to pen my own story because I have that government restriction for so long.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, I was going to say you're allowed now to do that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah, yeah, I have no restrictions whatsoever.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Except maybe when I fly into the United States from Bogota.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well, that's what we were going to talk about.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   What an interesting story.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And you may be in the market, I think, for a new MacBook.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Two weeks ago you were in Colombia, you were giving a speech?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Yeah, I was in Bogota, Colombia for about ten days.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I was there giving a speech for LPMBO and visiting a girlfriend.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And then I flew out around September 16th.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And that's when the whole thing happened.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So you had with you -- you were coming from Colombia into the U.S. into Atlanta?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah, and I do it all the time.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I go to Colombia every two months, every month and a half.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Okay.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's like I'm constantly going back and forth.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I've been traveling internationally since 2003.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So what are those five years I've never had an incident.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Are you on watch lists?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I don't think so.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Well, maybe now.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Maybe now that I'm on your show.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So no, let's get down to the details of what happened exactly because I've been claiming for the last
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   couple of weeks that nobody ever gets stopped under this proviso that they could take your
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   laptop so I'm looking at.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We're still here.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm going to turn them up for you.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Okay.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah, actually John, that's the people are getting stopped.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Some people are getting stopped a while.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Well, that's what we say.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I'd like to hear the actual details of this stoppage or the stoppage.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, it all started when we talked about ACTA, the law that they're trying to enforce,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.800]   that gives customs officials the right to take anything if they think there's something stolen
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   on it.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   What happened to you, Kevin?
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   Okay, so I landed it from Bogota into Atlanta.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   I go through passport control.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.400]   I do this all the time.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   It's what?
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Second nature.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.280]   The guy scans my passport and all of a sudden he's reading something on the computer.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.520]   His eyes are moving.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.760]   And right then I knew that was a bad sign.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.640]   And then not only did his eyes start reading some text, but he started typing on the computer.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.600]   And that of course gave me a very uneasy feeling.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   And then he started to smile.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.200]   This guy had a big smile in his face.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.600]   He goes, "Hey, Kev."
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   I go, "Yeah."
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   Oh, that's a bad sign right there.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Hey, Kev.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   Hey, huh, yeah.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.200]   He goes, "There's some people downstairs that want to have a word with you, but don't worry.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Everything will be okay."
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.300]   He goes, "Go ahead and get your bags and just follow the way out and they'll be there
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.300]   for you."
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.000]   And I'm just going, "Oh my God."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   So I go over to the baggage claim.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800]   I'm waiting for my bags.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.880]   And all of a sudden I get a call from my girlfriend from Bogota.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.400]   And she goes, "Honey, honey."
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   "Yeah."
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   She goes, "The police here just called me.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   There's a problem."
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.480]   And I go, "What?"
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.400]   She goes, "You know that package you sent to the United States a couple of days ago?
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.800]   Well, they found cocaine.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   They need to open the package.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   They found cocaine."
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.400]   Now Columbia is a big cocaine country.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   So...
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   I don't do drugs, right?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   I don't even smoke pot.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   You do tuna fish.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah, tuna fish.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That's a silly drug.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.040]   So I'm going, "Uh-oh, this is what this all is all about."
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.920]   Somebody put some contraband in some of my equipment at one of these mailbox sending
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.120]   places and now I'm getting jerked around and I'm going, "Oh my God, how do I prove my
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   innocence?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   I had nothing to do with this."
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   I have a question.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.800]   They accused you of sending cocaine to Columbia?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.600]   No, from Columbia to the state.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   The aesthetic.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.040]   Sorry, that was a little unclear to me and I thought that would be kind of original.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.760]   And next, I can't hold the package.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   I got a package and the police called there from FedEx going, "We detected cocaine and
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.120]   they wanted permission to actually break open the electronic equipment I was sending."
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   What were you sending?
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.200]   I was sending a Maxter hard drive.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:51.680]   I was sending some stereo equipment, Sylvaniers that I purchased in Carta Hana and Medellin.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.720]   So I just sent a box of stuff because my luggage was heavy and when you have heavy luggage,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   they ding you at the airport for like 200 euros and I didn't want to get dinged.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.560]   So FedEx was much cheaper.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.240]   So it was just a bunch of electronic stuff.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   So I'm Sylvaniers.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.000]   So I'm sweating it.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.040]   I'm going, "Oh my God, what happened?"
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.600]   I'm out there waiting for my luggage.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.840]   It's taking a real long time.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.600]   I power up my MacBook.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.560]   I check my mail because I have a Verizon wireless card.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.200]   And to me, I was thinking, "Well, if I had something to do with my computers, they certainly
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.320]   wouldn't let me be using them in between the time of getting that message from the passport
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.400]   guy and then being spoken to."
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.600]   So then eventually I get my luggage.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.160]   I go down to downstairs.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.840]   They redirect me and they hand me this like Manila folder that was green with some paperwork
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.440]   in there.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.040]   And they instruct me to put all my baggage on to this conveyor belt because I knew they
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.120]   were going to do a search.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.360]   So the first thing they pull out of my carry-on bag was a thing called an HID card spoofer.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   And I demonstrate this for--
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.920]   Well that's not a good thing to have with you.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   What is that for?
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.000]   That's when I go around the world doing security demonstration, like a security magic show.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.560]   So I bring all this equipment.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.840]   This demonstrates how you could spoof HID cards.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.600]   So if I get close to you, I could read your card and I can push a button and spoof it.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.200]   So if I have one of those little cards that you get into doors with, you don't have to
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.000]   steal the card, you just get close enough, you can read it and copy it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Are those legal loan?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Okay.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.840]   Well, probably any electronics that you use for illegal purposes may be illegal, but there's
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   no crime against possessing one of those.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   Right.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   So probably if you used it illegally, you'd be breaking the wall.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   Well, of course, yeah.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   Right.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.720]   So he pulls this out and the guys at the eye widen.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   And he's going, "What is this?"
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   We got one.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.200]   And then I'm going, "Well, that's an HID card spoofer."
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   He goes, "A card spoofer?"
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.840]   He goes, "It reads cards?"
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.480]   And I go, "Yeah, like the one dangling around your neck."
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   Oh boy.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   Right?
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.640]   And then they're getting excited, you know, because they're like, "I think they're going
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.600]   to be rolling in the big fish for something."
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.480]   So then he's searching for more and I'm skipping some of the stories so I don't go on and
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.480]   on.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.720]   And then he finds my southward lock picks that.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.400]   Now those are illegal, aren't they?
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   No.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.920]   Not in Colombia, not in Atlanta, not if you're...
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.160]   I thought you had to be a locksmith to have one of those.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   No, no, maybe you're probably not allowed to have them drive them around in your car
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   like in California.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   Right.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.840]   But if you're at an airport, it's in your check luggage.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   It's illegal.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   What are you going to do?
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   Pick the bathroom lock on the airplane.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   Well, what are you going to do?
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   Go into the baggage area of the plane and like pick open the door.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   Right.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480]   I mean, it was in the check luggage.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480]   Okay.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   Yeah, I didn't put it on.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   This is post 9/11, so...
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   Well, they're like...
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   Well, they're like...
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   They're like...
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   They're like...
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   They're like...
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   They're like...
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   They're like...
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   They're like...
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   In transit...
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   They didn't know what they're going to find, right?
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.880]   But I mean, there's certain things I put in my luggage simply because I do not want to
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.720]   get into a discussion about them with anybody at TSA or Customs ever.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.200]   And I would put lock picking equipment in that particular category.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.800]   Yeah, I put my check bags because I actually show this with my art of intrusion talk.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah, no, I mean...
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   I mean, show the prop.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   You even need the stuff.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   You need the stuff.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.600]   Physical security is critical to have a secure site and a discussion.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   I mean, I'm not sure if I can show people, not.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   Totally makes sense, dude.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   By the way, most of the cockpit doors are push button locks, so I don't think that would
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   apply.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.160]   Can I bring something up because Patrick mentioned it earlier?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.680]   This doesn't sound to me like some random check of the laptops that were also fearful
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   of.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   There was somebody tipped off somebody else and they decided to do this.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.640]   Like a normal stop that you would have had any time if somebody was suspicious.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.960]   No, but no, actually the ice agent, and that's later on in the story, told me they actually
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   had no suspicion.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.200]   They just stopped me just because they can, that they had no probable cause or suspicion
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   that I had done anything wrong, but they have the power to go through all my stuff.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   But you know what?
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.800]   Anybody coming through, they can look at you and say, "Hey, this guy, you know, I might
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   go through his stuff."
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.080]   Was it a flag on your name or was it just because you happened to be American leaving
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   the country?
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.200]   Obviously, it was on the computer I was flagged.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.720]   And I knew all my history.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.960]   Like I was in Italy last month and I brought like some kosher salami in.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.920]   And what I did is I declared it because it was on the customs forum.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.560]   And I actually knew all about that too.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   That's interesting.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.080]   Yeah, but that's also part of tracking activity and customs.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.360]   They got a dossier on you.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.200]   Yeah, but don't you think coming from Colombia maybe makes something to do with it?
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.280]   But he doesn't every two months.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   Is this the first time you've had any trouble?
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   First time.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.320]   And later on, I brought like five kilos of coffee.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.080]   They didn't even look at that.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.560]   They weren't interested in the coffee.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   But don't forget it.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   And through this, I'm thinking that this whole search and seizure thing had to do with this
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.240]   packaging in Colombia, right?
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.160]   I wasn't thinking that they wanted to search my electronic stuff until it started becoming
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   more clearer.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.720]   Yeah, but can I bring it?
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.160]   I'm sorry, can I bring it one other thing?
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   Don't you think?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.560]   You say that you make regular trips.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.880]   Regular trips is what a drug dealer would do and you would get stopped on occasion.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   It doesn't make a...
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.120]   I mean, I'm not just completely stunned by this.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.760]   You've got a convicted felon hacker.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.120]   He's got lock picks.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   He's got a card reader.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.760]   He's going to Colombia every two months.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   No, no, I know.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   But they found that out later.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.040]   I'm just saying he's going to Colombia on regular trips.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   They stopped...
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   You know, once in a while.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   They stopped me for going to Canada.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.360]   The point I'm making...
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   This is not that...
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.840]   What we're so fearful of is that they're going to randomly grab anybody and just to look
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.040]   at our laptop and see if we've got porn.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.840]   That's what we've been talking about for weeks on end.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   But if they...
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   They asked me about that.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.680]   When they specifically got to the point where they're going to do my electronic stuff, they
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.480]   were specifically asked me like five or six times do I have porn on my computer.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.360]   Yes, but did they grab the laptop?
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   There's a whole...
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   Yeah, of course.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   I wasn't getting to the interesting part.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.600]   So, eventually I got to tell you this because this is where it got funny.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.920]   He saw the lock picks.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.720]   I go, "Listen, I got a better lock pick kit that will open any door and it's much more
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.680]   compact and you can't even see it and let's see what to look for."
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.160]   And the guy's eyes widened as if I was going to make a confession.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.000]   Is this going to help you?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Given the guy a hard time?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   No, no, no.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   But I was like serious and sincere.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.480]   Was it a card in your wallet or...?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   Yeah, it was my business card.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   I've seen his card, yeah.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   It's a little lock pick.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.920]   Yeah, so my business card is a lock pick set.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.840]   So, right away they realized that having a lock pick set was now no big deal because
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.000]   it's in my business card.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.600]   So eventually they called in ICE agents which is Immigration Customs Enforcement and they
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.560]   told me they were asking me, "Well, why am I in Atlanta?"
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.640]   So was this the TSA that was talking to you initially?
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   No.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   These were...
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640]   This was the US Customs.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.640]   They're Immigration Customs Enforcement.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.920]   ICE are the ones that actually know how to do forensics.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.720]   They're the police arm of this.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Okay.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.680]   So after waiting like 45 minutes, finally ICE shows up.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.840]   This guy was a single ICE agent and it's like, "Why are you in Atlanta?"
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.080]   And I felt like saying, "Well, I am kind of a US citizen.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.840]   I figured I could be in Atlanta without a passport."
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   But I didn't say that.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.600]   So instead I told them the truth that I was moderating a panel for the ASIS International
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   Organization.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.400]   I have an FBI agent, the Cyber Crime Division that's actually on my panel and I'm doing
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.080]   this on Thursday.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.280]   This is why I'm in town and they said, "Well, you can you prove it?"
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.360]   I said, "Well, yeah.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   I have an itinerary.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   Would you like to see it?"
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.440]   They go, "Yes."
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.320]   And then I said, "Well, hand me my Macbook.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.680]   I got to go on the internet because it's on my Gmail."
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.160]   So they hand me my Macbook.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.120]   I plug in my Verizon card.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.320]   I power it up and the first thing Firefox does when I boot it up on my Mac is it asks
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.960]   you to clear private data and just instinctively I click yes.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.560]   And then right away they grab my laptop back thinking, "You know, I'm wearing evidence."
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.920]   Yeah, which I wasn't.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.920]   But that was beside the point.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.080]   So they grabbed it back.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.280]   Oh, so you claimed.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.960]   Believe me, if I was going to hide something, the whole hard drive would be encrypted.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   There would be no forensics.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:00.160]   I guess what I'm saying is like, this sounds more like a comedy of errors.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.080]   And a bad run of luck.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.960]   You can't see how the agents might have thought something was going on there.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.440]   Yeah, I can see it.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:12.720]   I mean, I was a funny looking kid who occasionally wore Rasta beanies and I got pulled over constantly
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.880]   in the state of New Jersey because they profiled.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.720]   And I had my car search probably over a dozen times.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   You had Rasta hair.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   You had like dreadlocks?
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   Rasta beanie a hat.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   I had a good day.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   Well, I don't think I fit the profile.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.440]   You know, I come into customs.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   I'm well dressed.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.200]   I'm not like in a T-shirt and jeans.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Well, what's I mean?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.320]   Because I can actually I can hassle more.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.040]   I've been hassled more in customs and by the TSA when I'm in business dress than I am
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.240]   in, you know, like scary skate rack clothes.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.480]   It's kind of funny.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.320]   Every time I go through TSA and they always do a bag check because of my business cards.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   And they love them.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.320]   They always want they always want one.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.720]   So a lot of TF agents are walking around with my lock pick cards.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.600]   You're like was you just he's just like having dangerous cards.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.040]   So yeah, so anyway, they grab it back and then I have to call the main number for the
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   FBI and DC.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.000]   I tracked down the agent, put him on the phone and then right away they think it's a big
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.240]   social engineering scam.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   They don't believe he's an agent.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.480]   They believe he's a comrade.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.440]   So that took another hour for them to figure out that it was a real agent.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.080]   An hour doesn't he carry ID?
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.560]   No, it's on the telephone.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   No, telephone.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   Right.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.960]   Anyone could be anyone on the telephone.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   You never know your dog on the internet, right?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.360]   You never know what the dog.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.800]   So and then the AFIS organization also has a lot of ex agents.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.360]   In fact, the guy that was the director of airport security was actually at the conference.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.320]   So he was also calling to find out like why am I being detained and so on and so forth.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   So all this stuff was going on.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.040]   And again, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking this has to do with this packed cocaine or
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   whatever that the Columbia and police here are looking into.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.820]   So eventually I get moved into this like interrogation room like early Kafka, Kafka
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.820]   and interrogation room.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.820]   It's all bugged.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.280]   It's all camera, audio recorded.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.080]   And then they start inventorying everything going through my bags and it surprised me how
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.320]   much electronic stuff like carry because I'm kind of a pack rat.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.600]   I don't even think about it.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.400]   I just throw it into my bag and I never, you know, clean it.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.960]   So I'm carrying like I was carrying like four Nokia phones, three iPhones, you know, maybe
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:32.280]   about 30 USB drives, you know, four Bluetooth, I had like a Akka Habara, you know, if you
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.720]   know that place in Tokyo, yeah, it was in my bag, Akka Habara in my bag.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.640]   So why do you have three iPhones and four Nokia phones?
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640]   I don't understand.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.400]   Well, the three iPhones I used to have the other, I have the one 3G that was on my belt.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.360]   So you then I had two 2Gs and the reason was that I have one 2G be on the US network
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.760]   and the other 2G be on the four network.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.640]   So I'm not getting killed with roaming rate.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   That makes sense.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.280]   So and then when I got the 3G phone, I just kept the 2Gs in my bag.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.720]   I didn't even think about, you know, leaving one of the 2Gs at home and, you know, just
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.480]   threw them both in.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.120]   So they've been--
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.800]   Patrick, are you typing Patrick?
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   It's John.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Is it John?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   I'm moving into this room and I'm sitting there.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   I'm a tattle.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.600]   And they decide they're going to inventory everything, which would take maybe about 18
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.160]   to 16 hours to go through all my stuff.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.760]   And eventually I-T agent shows back up and he's very apologetic.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.560]   He goes, listen, we got a call from the Atlanta FBI.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   They said that you're a good guy, that you're helping out, that you go around the world
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.040]   helping people.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.720]   And, you know, we're sorry that's happened to you as far as we're concerned.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.680]   I have nothing to do with this anymore.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.480]   And prior to doing this, this was the same guy that told me that all my equipment will
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   be seized probably up for 90-- for up to 90 days so they could do like a forensic analysis
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   of all my equipment.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   Now that's interesting.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.520]   What does it take to trigger that?
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.680]   Well, I basically said, well, why?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   And he says, because we can.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.440]   And I said, well, you know, you're right.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.880]   I read the court case that you guys have the power to take all my electronic equipment
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   and search it.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.040]   So if you do so, there's nothing I can do.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   There's electronic equipment.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.440]   Then a custom agent goes, well, why don't we see if this guy's going to cooperate with
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   us.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.960]   So he hands me my Asus 900 little notebook that I use in my pen testing demos.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.040]   And it's a little-- it almost looks like a CD player.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.200]   It's a pretty small notebook.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   And normally it boots off an SD card.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.520]   If you don't boot off the SD card, it burts off the firmware on the Asus Asus 900, which
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.600]   is like a bastardized Linux that I never use.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   Right.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   So I had the SD card, actually, my laptop case.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   And so he booted up.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   He says, OK, let's see if you're going to cooperate.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.640]   I want you to log us into this computer.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.720]   I'm thinking to myself, God, if I was in, I might be asking them to log-- I'd be asking
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.680]   me to log into my Mac, not to that thing.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   But OK.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   And I told them I said, listen, there's two accounts on there.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   There's one Kevin.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.400]   The Kevin account only has access to Kevin's files.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   And then there's another account called root.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.680]   And the root account has access to everything.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   I go, which one do you want me to log you into?
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   I guess.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   And you've had roots.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   And I could find.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   And he handed me the computer.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.960]   I put in the password, which was root backwards.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.880]   Tor, here that comes default on the firmware.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   And then they were looking on this--
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   There's nothing on it, of course.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.520]   --and I remember for a good 20 minutes looking for pornography.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.280]   They go, where do you have pornography?
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   And I go, I don't have it.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   Where do you go?
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   Where do you keep your porn out, dude?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.120]   Or they just-- maybe they were just after the porn for their own collections.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.120]   I don't know.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   But they're really into this porn stuff.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.560]   And I go, well, I'm sorry to say I don't have any on there.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   But you're welcome to look.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.360]   And so then-- I think I came in.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   He apologized.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.040]   Said that the FED said that they douch for me.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.600]   That I'm legit.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.880]   So then he says, well, I'm done with you.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.800]   But customs is a different federal agency.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.360]   So I'm clear of you.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   I'm done.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   He left.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   And he apologized.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.600]   He's a nice guy, actually.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   And then the custom agents continued inventorying my stuff, pulled out something for my laptop.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   Like, what is this?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   So that's a Bluetooth dongle.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Well, what does that do?
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   I said, you see your PDA on your belt.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.920]   And he goes, yeah.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   I said, well, I could take your address book if I want.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   Oh, shit.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920]   Why do you say stuff like that?
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   That's inflammatory.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   That's inflammatory.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   So the truth.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.920]   Because that's what I use it for.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   Right.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.920]   But I do it legit.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.920]   And they were very interested.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   You know, he turned off his phone, though, after I told him.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920]   Yeah, I bet he did.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   But you usually have to plug in the dongle into something.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   Right.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   The dongle doesn't work without--
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   No, of course.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   --into a device.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Right.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   And then the application for what it's used for, which I have no reason to hide anything.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   Right.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   OK.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   So then eventually, after about 30 minutes, they let me go.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   And I got to leave with all my computer equipment.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   Is there a big child porn traffic to Columbia?
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   Yeah, we still have all the porn.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   Did they ask you if you had any stolen movies or music?
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   Yes.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   They did.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.920]   And they also asked me whether the computers were all mine, where the phones all mine.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   And of course, I said I wouldn't be carrying them unless they were mine.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   I don't even know why they'd ask that question.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   But I--
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   Well, because if they find something on it, you can't say, oh, it must make my girlfriends.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   They're offering you an out when they do that.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   Well, they're offering you to incriminate yourself.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   But I mean, it was like four hours.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   And then, OK, so as soon as I get accustomed to letting me go, I call my girlfriend, and
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.920]   Bogota, and I go, hey, what's happening with this thing?
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   And she goes, oh, yeah, FedEx, they drilled your drive open.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   They drilled-- they used to drill.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   To drill it open, of course, damaging the drive.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   Right.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   Because they thought there was cocaine in the drive.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   They weren't looking for data.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920]   No.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   And they said there was nothing there.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   There was no drugs.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   And they just shipped the package back to the States.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   I have it already.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   And what I suspect that happened is I took it to a mailboxes, et cetera, and Bogota.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   It wasn't called mailboxes, et cetera.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   It was called something else.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   And they probably had-- they packed everything up.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   So maybe there was some cocaine residue on the paper, something tripped, the alarm at FedEx.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   And then that's when this whole thing happened.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   And of course, I didn't think it was a coincidence.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   I thought it was related.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   It was a coincidence.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   You think now?
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   Huh?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   Do you think it was a coincidence now?
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   Just bad.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   You know, why I thought it never got my equipment.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   Right.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   It looked for cocaine in that, too.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   And there was nothing on that drive.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   It wasn't like-- it wasn't even encrypted.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   So I think the point here-- I mean, look, obviously this is a bad circumstance all around.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   Maybe they knew a little bit about your history that might have encouraged them.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   But the point here is they're looking for what?
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.920]   Pornography and stolen music.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   Music and movies.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   That's what they were looking for.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   They have had several times.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   What movies do you have?
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   What music do you have?
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   What pornography do you have?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   And that seemed to be a real interest on their part.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   Is porn illegal there or something?
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.920]   What's the big deal?
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   It's in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.920]   At this time, I just don't understand why they need a big deal about the porn.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   They're looking for child porn or illegal porn of some kind.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   I don't know what else is illegal.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   I guess.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   Anyway, I have a security procedure that I've done for the last two years that I've traveled
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   overseas as any of my client data and any of my private data is encrypted and sent to the
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   office via the internet and wiped from my machine before I even get on the plane.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   You don't carry data across the border?
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   No, I don't.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   And if I do, it's encrypted, but that's lightweight data.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   If I'm working on a pen test for a client and I don't have the opportunity to time issue,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   I've got to land, I've got to go to the client's office.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   Then while I'll use TrueCrypt or PGP or something else, but now I'm going to up my security
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   where I'm going to go buy a new MacBook, it's going to be a clone of the one I already
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   have.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   I'm going to use probably Mac PGP to hold this encryption.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   So that way I'll have it at a family member's house.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   And anytime if my machine gets seized, you know, because I won't give up my own encryption
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   keys to anybody, they'd have to talk to them.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   Yeah, but they can hold you, they can compel you to give the keys.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   No, there was actually a court case in Vermont where a guy did say, "I'm not going to give
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   you the password."
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   The names of the files were sounded like child porn.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   He said, "No."
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   And the judge said, "No, it doesn't have to give it to you."
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   Yeah, but let's turn around already.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   That's fascinating.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   But right now in the United States of America, the law is you don't have to give up the keys.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   What they do is they just seize your equipment, but I won't really care because I'll have
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   a complete backup of everything.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   And it's really the data.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   And eventually they'll have to send me the hardware back because I don't have an exception
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   in my non-disclosure agreements with my clients, and I do a lot of security testing with some
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   Fortune 500 companies.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.920]   I don't have a disclosure and they're saying I could disclose it to customs or I could
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   disclose it to federal agents.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   I don't have that in there.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   So I could legally be sued if I don't protect any information that's held under the NDA.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   I care more about that than my private email.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   Because at the truth be known, a lot of my email goes through Gmail and I'm sure a lot of
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   employees at Google have access to it.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   So it's my client stuff that's encrypted or private that I care about.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.440]   Well Kevin, I'm glad we could get you on.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.280]   It does sound like something that maybe some people should pay attention to in the future
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.440]   and follow your protocol about being at least very careful about what they carry across
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   the border.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.200]   And of course I don't condone taking anything illegal like Charles porn or any stolen information.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.880]   I'm just saying your civil liberties and protecting your privacy I think is important.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.000]   And if you have any data that's under a non-disclosure agreement, you could be sued if that ends
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.920]   up in the wrong hands.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   And I think by encrypting it, you could show if there is a court case later that you took
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.440]   reasonable measures to protect your client's information.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:53.840]   If you don't take any reasonable measures and you knowingly go through a border, then
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.280]   is it arguably that you're not protecting the information under the NBA?
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.440]   I don't know.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   What's the new book going to be called?
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440]   Kevin, your memoir.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   I don't know yet.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   I have to come up with it.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   The best title is taken.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.520]   I can't take it.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520]   What's the best title?
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.720]   Catch me if you can.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.480]   Kevin Mitnick is at mittnicksecurity.com and he's always been a great friend and it's
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.800]   really good to talk to you.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.560]   His books, The Art of Intrusion and The Art of Deception are out and available.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.520]   Intrusion talks about the real stories of hackers.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   Fascinating stuff.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.680]   The Art of Deception is all about social engineering and both are very valuable.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.080]   I guess if we go to mittnicksecurity, we can get a schedule of your upcoming speaking
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   engagements.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   I know you're very...
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   Yeah, but I have a speaking on traveling all the time.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.640]   You're going to stay in the country for a while now or are you afraid of crossing the
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   border again?
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   No, actually you have to travel out to Mexico in late October, later this month.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.520]   Hopefully the new Mac books will be out so I could not mind up before I leave.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   Good luck.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.240]   Are you a little nervous about crossing the border now?
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.600]   No, no, because I really...
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.320]   Even if they see my computer and did forensic analysis, I mean...
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.320]   There was nothing on it.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.600]   What had been the worst thing would have been...
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:12.560]   With my gig with ASIS, I had all my notes for my panel and those would have been gone.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.120]   Then I had a speaking gig in New York and all my whole presentation would have been gone.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.480]   So it would have really been a disaster.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.800]   But now I know to make sure I have a backup of anything important before I go through
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.240]   a US border stop.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   And I'm really...
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.560]   I have to say, I'm really thankful they could have made it a lot worse for me.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.480]   They could have been nastier, but they didn't take my equipment.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.800]   I guess they were just doing their job probably based on my criminal history.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:49.000]   But it was a really scary experience and why it was scary is because of that coincidental
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   incident happening in Bogota, Colombia.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.800]   So I actually thought somebody had put drugs in some package of mine and I was going to
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.840]   be the victim like that Australian girl in Indonesia or a valley where you heard these
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   horror stories.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.520]   And that's what I was really afraid of.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.880]   I wasn't really afraid of anything on my computer because, yeah, I could get sued if there's
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.960]   stuff disclosed under NDA, but it's probably unlikely if it was a search by a government
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   agency.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   I don't know.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   But that would really mean to me.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:24.840]   I was going to say I'd rather be sued than go to Turkish prison.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   Midnight Express.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.040]   Well, in case blogger Bob's of the TSA is listening.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   That's been Kevin Mushnick.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   And Kevin...
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   What?
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   No.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.440]   In case blogger Bob's listening.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   If we just...
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.120]   Kevin Mitznick, Mushnick, no, Kevin, thank you for joining us.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   Mittenickssecurity.com.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.640]   It's great to talk to you again.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   Stay in touch.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.720]   Well, Leo, what are we going to grab internationally together?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   No, never.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   Come on.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.040]   I'm right behind you, Kevin, in the line.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Right behind...
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   I don't know that guy.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   I don't know that guy.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   I don't know that guy.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   No, I wouldn't mind having that experience.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.480]   You know, if I've got some time to kill, it'd be better than waiting for a plane in a
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   hard seat in the airport lounge somewhere.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Depends on where you're going.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   You're in Leo.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   Have a great day.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   All right.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   Take care.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   Bye-bye.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Kevin Mittenick.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   We're going to get to the news of the day.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.920]   In just a second, there's quite a bit this week.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.280]   And of course, Patrick Norton, Veronica Belmont, both of Texilla are with us, as well as JohnC.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.480]   dvorak.org/blog, who's writing his memoirs even now.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   But before we...
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   I can't stop writing my memoirs.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.920]   Are you ever going to do memoirs?
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   I'd like to read your memoirs, John.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.120]   I'd like to hear the fictional memoirs of JohnC.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   Yeah, that'd be more interesting.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.120]   Maybe.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   The show...
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   JohnC.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   Dvorak is fictional.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   He's an ultimate man.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.920]   He died four years ago.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.600]   He's been played by an actor ever since.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:57.480]   The show brought to you by Gobi from Qualcomm, the global internet, global mobile internet.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.040]   The new Gobi devices a wireless network card built into many new notebooks from the leading
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.640]   manufacturers.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   And the beauty of a Gobi is it allows you to access multiple wireless carrier networks,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.320]   whether it's HSDPA, EVDO, anywhere in the world.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.000]   So you don't have to worry about which wireless carrier you're working with.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.200]   It works with them all.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   And it's built in, so no external little antennas to snap off or lose.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.040]   The world is your hotspot with multi-mode support.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.880]   And if you're a corporate network manager and you've got to buy, you get one device
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.160]   with multiple carrier support.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.920]   So there's only one skew for your notebook purchase anywhere in the world.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.160]   Gobi, the world is your hotspot.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.120]   Gobi powered notebooks are now available from leading notebook manufacturers.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:45.040]   Go to Gobi Anywhere.com/Devices.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.320]   That's G-O-B-I Anywhere.com/Devices, the Gobi notebook for you.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.400]   And when you're there, by the way, you can also subscribe to an RSS feed so that you
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.960]   can be notified of new Gobi enabled laptops.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.120]   I already put in my order for a...
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.760]   A Panasonic Toughbook with the Gobi.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.720]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.440]   G-O-B-I The World is Your Hotspot.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   Gobi from Qualcomm.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.680]   Thank you for their support.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.520]   This week in tech.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520]   So let's see.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.640]   There was so much to talk about.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.120]   Last week we ended the show.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.800]   We were a little bit worried because the copyright board was about to increase the royalty
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.080]   fee paid to the publishers of music from 9 cents a song to 15 cents a song for online
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   music stores.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:37.440]   Apple on last week said, "Hey, if they do that, we're closing the iTunes music store."
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   Can you believe that?
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.000]   We're closing the iTunes music store.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.440]   There'll be no profit in it.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.880]   We'll never find out if it was an empty threat because on Thursday the copyright board said,
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.880]   "Ah, right.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.200]   We're going to freeze the fee at 9 cents."
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.520]   Would they, Veronica, have closed iTunes?
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.200]   You know, I said I highly doubted it at the time.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.360]   I thought it was just a blast.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.040]   But then thinking about things they've done in the past, especially with NBC and taking
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.640]   all their shows off the iTunes store.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   Who knows?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.760]   They have the power to do this kind of thing.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.520]   And Jobs is known to be crazy.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.000]   You could see Jobs saying, "Ah, screw him."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.640]   And just saying, "We're shutting the doors."
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   It would have been a huge deal.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.280]   Can you imagine that?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Well I wonder if-
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   Go ahead then.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.400]   The DRAA would have freaked because if the recent rounds of statistics are correct, the
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.200]   iTunes is the number one retailer of music in the United States and they would have just
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.720]   effectively, through their lobbying program, killed iTunes.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:39.240]   And what a lot of people have said is that the RIAA, after the last copyright royalty
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.360]   board debacle was actually telling them to keep a little tame this time, keep a little
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.120]   more relaxed this time, no more Pandora events.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.760]   Well and that's good news too for Pandora because Congress passed that bill saying,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   "We're going to wait till the sound exchange negotiations are through and let them determine
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   the price."
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.920]   Remember again, this was another case where, you know, it's confusing because it was the
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.840]   publishers who were asking for the increase on music sales online.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.920]   And it was the RIAA asking for the increase on internet radio.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.240]   The labels were asking for radio.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.520]   The publishers were asking it for online stores.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.680]   But both of them wanted the copyright board to raise these royalties.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.280]   It's just plain greed.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.320]   And I think the key is on this is they want to squeeze until it breaks, right?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.160]   To get right to the point where either the iTunes music store closes or every internet
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.280]   radio station shuts down and just pull back a little bit.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.040]   So now what's happened, they push the copyright board, they push the copyright board.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.960]   Fortunately, Congress said, "Okay, we're going to step in.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.400]   We're going to kind of say, "Hold on.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.520]   Negotiate a deal with sound exchange.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.920]   We don't want Pandora to go out of business."
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.080]   Tim Westergren has said, "This is very good news for Pandora.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.160]   They've saved internet radio."
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   Thank goodness.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   And it took a lot of work.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.320]   That bill's been online for some time, I think.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.680]   I've actually surprised, given everything else Congress has been doing, they managed to get
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   that through.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   Now, the president hasn't signed it yet.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:12.040]   Once that first $140 billion report gets taken care of, it's like it's easy.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.720]   Can you believe that?
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.040]   It's crazy because it's a $700 billion bailout and then they just tack on more.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   And then it's okay.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   With narrows.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   Free money.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   Oh.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.880]   Man, why you can't?
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.600]   I just hope this election, they just throw the sons of guns out.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   Just throw them all out.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.200]   Yeah, that happens.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.800]   There apparently, there are more, we're not going to get political here, but apparently
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.440]   there are a large number of seats now that are at risk.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.360]   Well, I should point out, when Leo says, "throw the sons of guns out," he means the entire
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   House and Senate.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   Let's start over.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Fresh start.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.160]   Well, they're not all up for real re-election.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.600]   That's one of the rare times I'm in total political agreement with Leo.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.720]   But who do you elect that's going to be any better?
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   That's the problem.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.600]   Come on, who's going to say it?
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   Leo for Congress.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.840]   No, I'm not running.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.800]   I think you're sure.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:07.080]   Did you, any of you guys order G1 phone, the Android phone, the Google phone?
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.640]   No, I can't switch back to T-Mobile.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   I'm more.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   Fortunately, I already have a T-Mobile SIM in my Blackberry curve.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.080]   I'm in the process of trying to get one.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.520]   I sent an email to Google.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.680]   They said that we will try to get you one under embargo.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.800]   But don't worry, the embargo will be lifted before October 22.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.400]   That's the day I'll be getting one anyway, because I did immediately order one.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.600]   Hey, you know Ryan actually got his hands on one for the day.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   I saw.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   He loved it.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   He loved it.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.000]   Ryan Block of gdgt.com has a review.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Tell us a little bit about what he seemed to really like it.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Actually, do you want to tell them about the Google Android?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Look at this.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Look at this.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   An instant guest appearance.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   Ryan Block.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.520]   Hey Ryan, the gdgt going great.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.480]   It's going well so far.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.520]   We haven't actually launched yet, but what we have launched namely the podcast.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   Love the podcast.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   Yeah, it's doing pretty well so far.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.920]   I listened to your Android cast, but you got your hands on one.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.160]   You got a G1.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.640]   I did for a short amount of time about a day.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.840]   I got to hang out with it and put it through its paces.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.280]   It's not enough time to really know.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.520]   I couldn't do a review of a product like that.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.760]   It's got so much about it to know and so many nuances to discover in such a short amount
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   of time.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.360]   Having spent the day with it, I really, really like it.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   Why?
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   It was that John?
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.320]   Yeah, of course.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   Why did I like it?
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.840]   Well, it's very snappy.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.880]   It's very responsive.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.120]   It didn't feel sluggish or dogish in any way.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.640]   The browser is solid.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.320]   It's a distant number two mobile Safari on the iPhone.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   Really just it.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.080]   Yeah, it's just not quite there.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.840]   The usability is there's some really annoying things about it.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.560]   We've all played with the emulator in the SDK.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.920]   That gives you a pretty good idea what the browser can do.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.080]   Yeah, it's very simple stuff.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.960]   If you're loading a page, you want to stop.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.680]   You want to hit the stop button like you would on any other browser.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.560]   This is an especially important thing when you're on a mobile device and going back and
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.920]   forth can take longer than on a desktop.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.960]   Having quick access to a stop button is very important.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.680]   Android hides that behind a click.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.400]   You have to click like the browser buttons and then hit stop.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.440]   Very, very small, very simple thing.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.040]   It drove me absolutely crazy.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.440]   You said that the shelf didn't bug you either.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.040]   No, it didn't.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.800]   It was not that bad.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.960]   If you've ever used the sidekick, it either bugs you or it does.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   It's like the sidekick.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.880]   In fact, it slides up a little bit like the sidekick.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.680]   It kind of looks like a sidekick a little bit.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.600]   Well, Andy Rubin, who's the lead of Android at Google, he was one of the original side.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   That's right.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.960]   Yeah, so that's not a surprise.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.920]   Although HTC, which makes this handset, has a lot of experience with the tilt and the
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.720]   mogul and all of these other phones.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.640]   Does it feel similar to those?
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.880]   It does feel like a very high quality handset.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.840]   Mechanism, which I was actually a little worried about, it feels very strong.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   Not cheesy.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   It's very sturdy.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.400]   Yeah, it doesn't feel weak or flimsy.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.040]   It doesn't feel like it's going to fly off or anything like that, especially considering
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.480]   how much spring they put into it.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.240]   The whole handset just feels really solid.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:34.040]   I mean, considering that unlike the first gen iPhone, it's not a big brick of metal.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.400]   There's glass or chrome or metal on this thing.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:43.200]   It's all pretty much plastic, but for a largely plastic cell phone, it feels really solid.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   Keyboard?
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.240]   It's flat, which is a little bit of a bummer.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   But not bad.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.800]   I mean, it's got a good feel to it, good tactility.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.920]   It's large enough that I have really stubby fingers, really stubby thumbs.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.120]   It's large enough that I was able to type on it very easily.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.720]   Good, because I have stubby thumbs.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.440]   I think you'll be OK.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   It's a thumb type.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   I hate it.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   I can't type on it because I have stubby fingers.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   I can't either.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   I found the Android.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.120]   I mean, the G1 keyboard would be pretty good.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.240]   Predictive text, T9 or something else?
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.560]   Well, there isn't really any predictive text that I saw just because you've got the keyboard.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.880]   You don't need it.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.080]   Most phones that have a keyboard like that.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   They don't bother.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   Including Windows Mobile phones.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.280]   Yeah, they don't really bother with the predictive text.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:38.600]   So I ordered one just because I think that it's going to be a pretty strong competitor.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   Thank you, bye.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   Well, yeah, OK, that's the real reason.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.200]   But it's a very interesting contrast between this phone and the iPhone.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.120]   It's almost exact opposite in many ways.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.080]   As much as it looks the same and has similar functionality, it's open in almost every
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.640]   way possible except for the T-Mobile network.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.120]   But they're going to make other companies, they're going to make handsets and other carriers
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.200]   are going to-- we've already announced, they're going to carry it.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.280]   So it's really an open operating system.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.120]   Yeah, the interesting thing about that is because it's so open, they basically can't
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.040]   stop people from unlocking it.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.920]   Well, that's very intriguing.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.960]   They're saying they're-- T-Mobile's saying we're going to block tethering.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   How?
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.080]   No, well, I mean, they're paying that lip service.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.160]   They don't want to encourage people to do it.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.800]   But a lot of journalists, including some of my friends at Engadget, kind of cornered
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.440]   them after the Android event in New York and said, look, level with us.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.120]   You're not going to be able to stop anybody from doing this.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.120]   And they said, yeah, we know.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.240]   I mean, we're saying we don't encourage that behavior.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   But they know.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   I mean, they're not stupid.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   They know there's no way they can prevent people from tethering this to the laptop or
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.280]   unlocking these devices.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.840]   And that's something that they are aware of and that they have to deal with that if they
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.160]   want to have this kind of a device.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.000]   It's interesting because a sidekick on T-Mobile was more locked down than even the iPhone.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.760]   It was the ultimate in lockdown devices.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.000]   Do you think Andy Rubin learned his lesson and said, let's not this time around?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.400]   No, I mean, the sidekick was never meant to be a power user phone.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   It was never meant to be a smartphone.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.080]   It was a completely different kind of device.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.200]   It was locked down the same way that most quote unquote feature phones are locked down.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.640]   And that is, you know, they don't really have an app ecosystem.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.040]   They don't, you know, they're not really meant to be expanded.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.960]   They're kind of an out of box experience.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.560]   Well, you could buy apps, but a very limited subset.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.080]   Right.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.240]   So the T-Mobile is going to have its app store, but then there's still the Google apps that
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.880]   you can, you're not tied to T-Mobile's app store on this.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000]   Well, it's not actually T-Mobile's app store.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   It's just called the Android marketplace.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.600]   And so there's not going to be a separate hand in it.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.920]   No, I mean, I'm pretty sure that no matter what Android device you're using this, this
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.520]   marketplace, yeah, it's going to work on all of them.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.200]   You can actually, according to what we had one of the Google guys on cranky geeks last
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.760]   week and you can actually just develop whatever you want and put it on your own website and
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   sell it that way.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   Right.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   That's the app.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.360]   This whole lock down, you know, owner's lockdown system that Apple has is out.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   So they'll be flat.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   They'll be Skype.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.320]   They'll be everything that you can't get on the iPhone.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.400]   Well, yes and no.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.840]   I mean, Flash is one of those interesting and peculiar things where you actually have
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.960]   to kind of build that into the browser, especially on a mobile device.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.880]   So it's going to partly be up to them to have that.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.960]   But there's nothing to say that Mozilla team couldn't develop a version of Firefox for
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   Android that incorporates Flash from the ground up, right?
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.200]   But yeah, I mean, John is right.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.400]   You don't have to use the marketplace.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.960]   That's kind of the thing with Apple is you have to use the marketplace.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.040]   There's no way that you can't use the marketplace.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.840]   Well, on Android, you don't have to use the marketplace.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:45.160]   Even if you want to use the marketplace, they're not really going to be checking to
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.320]   make sure that your app isn't evil or anything like that.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.400]   I mean, you know, it's going to kind of be.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.720]   There's no vetting processes.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   There is a.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.240]   I think that there is a smaller vetting process, but it's more to the developer and not to the
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   app.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.560]   Basically their vetting process is you must prove that you are who you say you are.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.480]   So if something bad does happen, we can get a hold of you.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.160]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.200]   I mean, as far as I know, that's more or less the extent of the vetting process.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.680]   But you still don't have to use the marketplace.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.080]   There's an option deep within the G1 settings within Android settings, which allows you
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:24.000]   to enable using unsigned apps, apps that were not downloaded from the marketplace.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.720]   So you can just grab apps from the internet.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.080]   It gives you a little warning.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.360]   It says, well, you know, we can't really keep track of what you're doing with these apps
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   or whatever.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   If you do that, it's going to be a little bit more unsafe, but you can do it.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.320]   I mean, here you have the lockdown phone with seamless user experience.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.960]   That's the Apple idea versus something wide open where, yeah, users are going to put stuff
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.480]   on stuff runs in the background.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   They're going to crash it.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.880]   But all sorts of stuff can happen.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   And yet they have freedom.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.360]   And I'll be very curious to see who's attracted to which way of being and which one does better,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.720]   ultimately, is really the key.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   What do you think?
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.360]   I think it's a good alternative.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.920]   It's not meant to be the iPhone.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.000]   I think in many ways it's meant to be the anti-iPhone.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   The anti-iPhone, yeah.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.440]   I mean, I think a lot of people are kind of, there's a certain set of people with the iPhone
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:14.000]   who kind of get those limitations and they're looking for a good alternative.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.600]   And I would place myself in that group.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.360]   But I think most people, the vast majority of people who have an iPhone are probably not
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.520]   going to look at the G1 and say, "Oh, I really want that."
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   I mean, this is really, it's a phone that when it launches, it's going to be targeted
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.040]   towards the Geeksat, in my opinion.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.840]   That's why I ordered one.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   Can't wait.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.840]   Cannot wait.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.840]   Ryan, thank you so much.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   I'm a big fan of the package.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.840]   I appreciate it.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   Talk to you guys.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.840]   All right, take care.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.840]   It's nice to get you on.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   Ryan blocked from GATT.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.800]   GDGT, which doesn't say anything.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   It doesn't mean gadget.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   It's just GDGT.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.400]   It does actually mean gadget.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.400]   It does?
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.600]   Yeah, you can also say it gadget.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   You can?
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   I thought Ryan said we shouldn't do that.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.200]   He prefers GDGT, but don't listen to him.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.240]   It's a lot easier to say gadget.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.680]   GDGT is hard to say.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.600]   All right, I got my headset back.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.200]   Yay, you were very nice if you've run to let that guy enter Loper's just kind of...
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.440]   Well, it was actually perfect timing because I am Tim for one of the remaining guinaces
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.040]   in the fridge because it was getting to me about 200 degrees in the office and he came
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.000]   in and you asked about Android and I was like, "Well, this is perfect timing."
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.720]   I'm going to go get up here.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.520]   Well, I'm glad you keep your Guinness cold.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   Very important.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   Indeed.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.160]   All right, we're going to talk in just a bit about how Craigslist can be used to, I don't
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.200]   know, set up bank heists.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.400]   Turns out to work quite well.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.680]   Before we do that, I want to mention the folks at GoToMeeting.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.480]   They are supporting this podcast.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   We support them.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.800]   I've used GoToMeeting for years to do online meetings.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.000]   They've been advertising with me for something like five years now and I'm really proud of
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.120]   the relationship with Citrix, the makers of GoToMeeting and GoToMeeting.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.680]   Now on Mac or PC, I want to tell you how you could try it free for 30 days, but first
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.360]   let me tell you what it is.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.720]   If you're setting up conference calls online meetings and you really want people, let's
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.960]   say you got a PowerPoint presentation, you got a client across the country.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.520]   You do not want to spend money on an airplane ticket.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.680]   You do not want to go through what Kevin just went through at the airport.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.760]   You do not want to get the middle seat for four hours.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.280]   You just want to show them the PowerPoint.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Simple as can be.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   You set up GoToMeeting.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.880]   It takes just a couple of minutes to set it up on your computer and then you call your
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.400]   client and say, "I'd like to show you something.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.920]   Go to GoToMeeting.com and enter in this meeting ID."
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   What is it?
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.840]   Six, eight, digit numbers, something like that.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.800]   All of a sudden he's seeing your computer on his screen.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.440]   He sees your PowerPoint.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.920]   You can show him documents.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.760]   You can show him drawings.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.360]   You can collaborate on stuff together.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.720]   I've done it for...
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.280]   I just used it a couple of weeks ago for his speech.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.120]   We had a rehearsal slideshow and GoToMeeting is so liquidy split fast that we could rehearse
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   in real time.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:53.200]   The slideshow that had 60 slides and 60 minutes, it was boom, boom, boom, boom, worked great.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   Go to meeting.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.680]   Now try it free by going to GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   Go toMeeting.com/twit.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.320]   You get 30 days unlimited use.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.520]   That's a month of unlimited online meetings free.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.000]   Now by the way, you're going to get used to this and you'll be glad to know it's still
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.320]   every month one low flat monthly rate.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   You don't have to count meetings.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   You don't have to count minutes.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   Meet as much as you want.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   You're going to find a lot of uses for this.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.320]   Go toMeeting.com/twit.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:25.120]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.440]   So I love this story.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.800]   There's going to be a movie made out of this.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.440]   It's just too good.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.400]   Bank of America, Bratch Monroe, Washington.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.240]   Guy comes in dressed.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.880]   Did you hear about this one, Patrick?
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.160]   He's dressed in a vest, a yellow vest, safety goggles, a blue shirt and a respirator mask.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.080]   He looks like, I guess, a construction worker.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.760]   He goes over to the guard.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   Actually, it's not in the bank.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.920]   It's at the curb of the bank.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.880]   He goes over to the guard who's supervising the unloading of cash from the truck.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.840]   Spraze the guard with pepper spray, grabs the bag of money, runs off.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.960]   Okay, but get ready for this.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.440]   So the cops come, the guys are chasing after them on foot.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.800]   All of a sudden, they run into a gaggle of people dressed in yellow vest, safety goggles,
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.840]   blue shirts and respirator masks.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.520]   There's dozens of them on the street.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   They were responding to a Craigslist ad.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:29.000]   The ad and Craigslist said that there was a good job paying 28.50 an hour.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.560]   They were looking for road maintenance workers.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.560]   They say, wait near the Bank of America, wearing yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.040]   mask, preferably a blue shirt, a dozen show up.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.920]   The cops running them, they can't find the crook.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.480]   He's gone.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.960]   Eventually, they didn't find this.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   I don't know.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   This gets a little weird.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.200]   They found the getaway inner tube.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   Apparently.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.040]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:51:00.360]   What apparently he jumped in a creek at the Skykamish River near Monroe without a paddle.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.640]   With that well, an inner tube, a respirator, a blue shirt and safety goggles, goes down
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.640]   the creek and his inner tube, gets away, scott-free.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.160]   And according to this story on CNET News, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark was not immediately
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   available for comment.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.760]   I love that story.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.400]   Oh, guys, not available for comment on anything.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   I know.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.720]   Craig, did you hear people use Craigslist?
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.440]   Now, doesn't that sound like, I mean, you'd make more money writing the movie script than
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.600]   you would robbing a bank on that one.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.680]   That's a brilliant idea.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.480]   And all those poor saps didn't get paid either.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   No, they didn't get their 2850.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   Not a damn cent.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   They're probably...
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   It's a...
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.480]   You can get the job they came out for.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.840]   No, it was a good job.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   It was exploited.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   Yeah, it's exploiting the workers, taking advantage of our economic crisis.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:52.000]   No, I mean, you could post an ad like that and get a bunch of people anytime in the
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   country.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:23.320]   I think the commercial markets...
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.760]   There's a lot of empty offices, too.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.400]   Did they ever fill the...
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   What was it?
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.320]   The fashion center that we were in?
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.080]   Where tech TV was, it was empty when we got there.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   But that was also...
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.440]   I mean, it was empty when we were going left.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.560]   There's a difference, though, between building class A office space in the financial district.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   I suppose.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.040]   They're building a lot of towers down in South San Francisco and Brisbane.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.040]   Really?
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.240]   There's a lot of construction going on in that area.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   Yes, there is.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   And there's a lot of...
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.000]   And they're still building all the medical center stuff down on China Basin, just north
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.240]   of our third street, just north of our studios.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.720]   And I'm told...
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.440]   Karen tells me is the Skykomish.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.960]   You should have corrected me, John, the Skykomish River.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.880]   You know, there's so many screwball names up there.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.400]   Snohomish, Skykomish, Skawomish, Skawomish, Skawomish.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   We're sick.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   Snohomish.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.040]   I mean, you go nuts looking at these crazy names.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.600]   My screwball, you mean Native American, right?
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.240]   Everyone of them is some little tribe.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.440]   By screwball, I'm talking about my friends, the Native Americans.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.800]   Mafia Boy is writing a memoir.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.400]   I should have asked Kevin about this.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.560]   Kevin's writing his memoir.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.000]   John's writing his...
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.320]   Michael, I guess his name is Kelsey, is writing a memoir.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   He's the guy.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.560]   You remember this, Patrick, because we were on the air.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.920]   February 2000, who shut down CNN Yahoo! Amazon, eBay.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   With a...
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.600]   It was the first time I think most people had ever heard of a distributed denial of a service
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   attack.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:01.440]   I remember calling around, calling experts, saying, "What is a DDoS?
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.880]   How do they do it?
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.480]   Learned about sin floods."
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.600]   So his book is going to be called...
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.280]   I'm not buying it, by the way.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.980]   His book is going to be called Mafia Boy.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.660]   How I cracked the internet and why it's still broken.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.580]   By the way, can I...
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:23.700]   I'm still looking over this rubber, higher D-coise story.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.700]   Yes.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.420]   Did they ever mention how many people they managed to attract?
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.460]   You said about a dozen.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.460]   That's it?
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:31.460]   Well, a dozen's enough.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.780]   I was just thinking it might be an interesting way to harass companies you don't like.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.780]   Well, what?
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.220]   You say dress up as a giant rat and stand outside and walk over here.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:44.020]   You probably would have had better luck just announcing some kind of flash mob.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.300]   Like come down sometime in the afternoon.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   It's going to be hilarious.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.300]   Bring your camera phone away.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:50.300]   It'll go up on the internet.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.300]   It'll be huge on YouTube.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:57.100]   And that's when Veronica began writing the core themes for hackers too.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.260]   Veronica has got...
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.260]   Everybody's got a script in there.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.260]   No roller blades.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.420]   They're a little drawer there.
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   You have a script.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.420]   That would kept in my pocket.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.260]   You know, there's been a bunch of interesting rumors floating around recently.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.620]   I've got one that's kind of funny.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.620]   All right.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.620]   Let's hear it.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:15.180]   It says that the ATM machine, because of our financial crisis and they had these banks
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.020]   are all screwed up, that all the ATM machines will be out of money this week.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.020]   Wow.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.020]   Also, you got an ATM machine is going to say, "No, I'm out of money.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.020]   Sorry."
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.020]   That's a guaranteed way to start a bank run.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.020]   Oh, no.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.020]   But guaranteed.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.020]   I don't know why.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.140]   But people were saying that though, but people were saying that John because if the...
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:37.740]   A lot of people were saying if the $700 billion financing, if the American people not paying
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.900]   for the Wall Street screw-ups doesn't go through.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.980]   I understand there's some viable reasons for wanting to keep credit flow and blah, blah,
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   blah.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.300]   But boy, I mean, if you wanted to...
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.820]   Remember, I saw it's a wonderful life.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.780]   I remember all the guys, you know, all the people saying you can't have your money at
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.180]   the bank and it's shutting the doors.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:01.420]   I mean, that's how you start a run on the bank as you go to the ATM and nothing comes
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:02.420]   out.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.060]   Don't you think you'd immediately go in and demand all your deposits?
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.060]   And of course, the bank doesn't have it.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.060]   Well, you're okay.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.060]   You're in charge after you're in charge after you're in charge.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.820]   You're in charge of the dollars, right?
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.820]   Nobody in there.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.620]   We don't have bank runs anymore.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.100]   That's the reason they have that insurance.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.100]   But that was...
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.940]   But John, the stuff I was hearing from guys in New Back in New York were like, yeah,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:22.780]   if things get squirrely, you may want to have a few hundred put aside just to buy groceries
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:23.780]   and stuff for a day.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   Under the mattress.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.260]   Yeah, because they expected it to go old school.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.940]   Yeah, so let's say the bank goes under and I've got whatever my $50,000 in the bank or
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:33.940]   whatever she has.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:34.940]   It doesn't.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.860]   I'm not going to get that money tomorrow.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.860]   I'm not going to get that money next week.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.860]   I'm not going to get that money.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.460]   You need $50,000 tomorrow.
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.460]   Any money.
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.460]   What do you think they're going to do?
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.860]   FEMA is going to set up a card table out in front of the bank and give me $10 bills?
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.300]   Well, you just have a bad attitude.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.860]   They have had bank runs in London and Amsterdam.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:56.060]   I think Ireland and now I think Iceland is out of money.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.260]   Most of this is because they bought our craft, our loans.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.140]   I think we're the only ones in good shape.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   Whoops.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   Now, IndyMac.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   How did that...
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.780]   Isn't that kind of what happened at IndyMac?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.780]   Because if people said, "I want my money."
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.780]   That was a bank run.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   These bank runs come and go.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   I thought you said we didn't have bank runs in the United States, John.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.780]   You don't.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.780]   They go mostly.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   But when they happen they go.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.060]   Because you get a bunch of dummies that don't realize that this money is secure and they
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.060]   do it.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.780]   Well, there's a difference between secure and...
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   Everybody...
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.780]   We got to buy groceries next week.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.580]   You should...
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.580]   I mean, it doesn't mean that money's not there.
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.580]   John feeds the correct voice for reasons.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.380]   Reminds all Twit listeners.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.380]   Do not run on the bank.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:48.900]   Add FDI insured and not all banks, especially if you live in an urban metropolis and speak
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.780]   a foreign language as your primary means of communication.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.580]   Not all banks are FDI-C insured.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.180]   I'm taking all my money out tomorrow.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.180]   See?
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.180]   See?
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.180]   See?
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.180]   That's how it happens.
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.180]   See?
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.180]   You panicked me now.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.180]   Yeah, panicked.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.180]   Totally panicked.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.180]   Not panicked.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.460]   Citizens, citizens, stay off the streets.
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:11.420]   So there is no cause for alarm.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.700]   Not to ever go into Japan tomorrow.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:14.700]   Are you really?
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.700]   What you doing there?
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.380]   Took your game show.
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:19.620]   So this is core work.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.620]   Yes.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.620]   Yes, this is core work.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:23.620]   Is core work like Pilates?
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.620]   I know.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.620]   You're kind of like...
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:29.300]   I have never gotten mad about you talking about core.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.180]   Not even a little bit.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:35.860]   And the last time you said something like that, we both got like 400 emails about how we hate
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   each other.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.860]   We have to talk about being in the last seven weeks fight.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:39.860]   They get real mad.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.860]   They love each other.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   Who?
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.580]   I love you, John.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.100]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.500]   You know, Veronica is basically like the Mike Scott, like the office.
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.500]   Like what's his name?
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.780]   The guy at the start of off the office, Mike Scott.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.100]   Who goes off to make his movies?
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   Well, everybody...
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.460]   And you're going off to make your movies and everybody just kind of wait until you come
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.660]   back so they could do a show.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   You're like the big star.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.660]   No, don't say that.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.140]   You just do it without her?
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   Life goes on without her.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.140]   Currently.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.940]   That's kind of discouraging, isn't it?
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.940]   No, it's awesome.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:11.940]   It's good.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.300]   Because then I like to watch it.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:17.820]   Not everyone, Leo, can chain themselves to their desk, you know, produce 20 hours of
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.620]   television a week, 52 weeks a year.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.060]   I can only do it because I'm sitting on a rubber ball.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.300]   Yeah, but I mean like, you know, you're going to take a vacation this year.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.300]   I am.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.300]   I am.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.300]   I'm going to take a vacation.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.300]   So are you going to...
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.300]   No, I have to shut down.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.460]   It's nobody unless you want to come here and sit in the ball.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.060]   I'll see what I can do.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.180]   You guys are all welcome to come on up here and, you know, we'll just leave the cameras
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.180]   running and just come on in.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:41.300]   You know, we're doing audio now too.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.740]   Streaming audio.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.900]   So I have 24/7 streaming audio and video most of the time, unless the, you know, stick
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.900]   him crushes.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.100]   I want to admit that you were in Christi.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.100]   Perrillo.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.100]   But there's something going on on this one.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.740]   A lot of times with Christ, you go there and it's just a...
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   He's just sitting there.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.260]   It's a lot of times.
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.260]   Most of the time.
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.180]   How do you guys keep up the energy to do this?
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.780]   I mean, I couldn't do it.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780]   I would just...
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   You know what?
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   Veronica, I can tell you this.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:12.060]   If we take a choice between you on 24/7 or Chris Perrillo or even Leo, I think you'd
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.060]   take the big numbers.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.060]   I'd take Veronica too.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.060]   Yeah, no.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.060]   Veronica, come up here.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.060]   When you get back from Japan, you come up here.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.360]   I'm going to go to France.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360]   You come up here.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.460]   And all the brain tonic you can drink.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.460]   Oh, man.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.460]   That's a...
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.460]   We got cases of it in the back.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.460]   That is 10 for the liver, Transplant.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460]   You know, we made them.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.340]   We actually made them a fun little commercial on Core One Day because we all drink it at
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340]   the office.
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340]   Really?
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.100]   And we sent it in because I had some zombie makeup on for something for a shoot.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100]   Oh my God.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.100]   You know, because it's brain tonic.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.940]   Zombies love brain tonic.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.940]   Brain tonic.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.940]   Oh, that's good.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.940]   And they didn't think it was funny.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.940]   Brain tonic didn't?
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.940]   No.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.620]   We just thought it would be funny to send to them because we had some extra time and we
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.660]   just shot it because we drink it all the time and didn't happen, didn't like it.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   I was like, "Man, it's zombies.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.420]   You can't go wrong."
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420]   Because it's actually addictive.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.420]   I'm so delicious.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.420]   Mmm.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.420]   You drinking one now?
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.420]   Huh.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   It tastes like a hard work urine, John.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420]   This is a thing.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.420]   And they have no sense of humor.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.420]   That is not super dope.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   I only have one question.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:17.300]   What does a hard work urine taste like?
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   A lot like brain tonics.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.300]   Does it taste kind of fresh and slightly grape fruity with a delicious afterglow?
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.300]   Afterglow?
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300]   And afterglow.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   Yeah, there's a little afterglow.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.900]   What does that stuff do to you?
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.100]   Well, it's got choline.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.340]   It's got eulutharococcus extract.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.740]   It's got rhodiola rosia.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.820]   It's got DMAE and blue green algae.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.420]   Got rhodiola and algae.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   Mmm.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.020]   It makes your brain glow.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.020]   Mmm.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.460]   This show, we're going to be back in just a moment, talk some more about the fascinating
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.900]   stories of the day, including John's presidential pick and his stock pick.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.220]   But first, it's time for an audible pick.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:56.020]   This show brought to you by the good folks at audible.com, our prime source for wonderful,
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.500]   wonderful reading material.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:02.020]   Hey, Dane, do we want to do the platinum offer again?
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020]   Are we platinum?
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.020]   Platinum.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   Platinum.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.340]   We're going to give you the platinum offer, folks.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:13.060]   That means you go to audible.com/twit2, twit the number two.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.060]   You sign up today.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.060]   You're going to get not one, but two books free, two books free.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.020]   That is a great deal.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.380]   If you decide not to stick around, no problem.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.380]   You get to keep the books.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.380]   They're yours to keep.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.220]   Don't I'm not going to give you two picks because that's just overkill.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.220]   But have you started reading Anithym, Patrick yet?
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:28.220]   Did you?
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.220]   I gave you my copy.
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.220]   Yes, yes.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.060]   I'm a couple of hundred pages into it and I'm waiting for a good break in the teething
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.260]   cycle to get a few hundreds more pages.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.100]   I'm reading it also.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.100]   It's so awesome.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.100]   Do you guys like it yet?
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.660]   The first 200 pages are a little rocky because you think what am I doing?
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.020]   You've got to get past the first 150 or so.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.420]   I mean, it's all smooth sailing from there.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.060]   But because you've got to get used to the language and you've got to figure out why am
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.060]   I in monastery?
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.460]   Well, I'm having bad dune flashbacks without all the cool here.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.140]   There's a little, but you know what?
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.300]   It's hanging there.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.940]   It's big science fiction.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.940]   It's big as always.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.380]   I've been a long time.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.500]   Neil Stevenson is always about ideas.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.860]   Vek even says in the prologue, look at this is just a thinly veiled excuse for giving you
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.780]   some of the most interesting ideas.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.020]   And that's where I was looking when I read it and I just I loved it.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.180]   Thirty two hours.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.180]   Unaudible.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.180]   Wow.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.580]   It is a long read.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.580]   Wow.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.580]   Yours free.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.380]   Now that's a deal, a thirty two hour book free.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.100]   By the way, it's multiple narrators, which is useful for this because there are a lot
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.740]   of different people, a lot of different voices in it.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.780]   Maybe I should do that for the flight tomorrow.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.620]   Oh, Veronica, I think so.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.500]   Get it right through your flight to Japan.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   How long is that?
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   Twelve hours.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   Eleven.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   You get it there and back and you'd still have some leftover.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.060]   You're going to need something to expand the battery life on your mp3.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.620]   How far are you in the book so far, Veronica?
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.860]   I'm on page almost.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.860]   I think I'm almost 400.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.860]   You've gotten the meat of it now.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.180]   Yeah, it's so good.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.940]   I already read it in paper.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.260]   In fact, I gave my copy to Patrick, but I want to download it to listen to it again.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.660]   A couple of Neil's books blow me away.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.900]   Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, and this is, I think, in that category.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.900]   Just brilliant.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.820]   I know that the broke cycle is pretty amazing.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.900]   So you liked that, Patrick, and I couldn't get into it.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   They now have it unaudible.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.900]   I might do that.
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:24.540]   It's worth it just to watch him characterize all these pivotal characters in science and
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:29.500]   actually the formation of banking and have them all together.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.380]   And the fundamental changes in religion during the road.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.380]   It's fascinating.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.140]   You talked me into it because I trust you.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.140]   I remember when Quicksilver came out, you and I were both first in line to get it.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.540]   I think we were flying somewhere.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.180]   Anithym, that's my pick.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.580]   Go to audible right now audible.com/twit2.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.100]   Get your audible book.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.340]   Two of them, absolutely free.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.940]   Look at, it's a whole world of listening.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:53.940]   I'm telling you.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.940]   You've got a flight ahead.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.940]   You've got a long commute ahead.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   You've got to have audible on your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom, your GPS, even.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.620]   Apparently, the number three and four devices are GPS devices.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   Make sense.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.100]   It's in the car already.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.100]   Audible.com.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.420]   What do you listen to?
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.580]   Your Audible books on Veronica.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.260]   Well, I have an iPhone.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   iPhone.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.260]   Perfect.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.260]   Mine's full of Audible books.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.260]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.900]   We thank them so much for their support of this weekend tech.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   Now back to the news.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.540]   So Steve Jobs is not dead.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.020]   Yeah, that ran the market up and down a couple of matches.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.020]   What the hell is going on?
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.100]   Okay, is this the death of citizen journalism?
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.100]   What's going on here?
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.740]   So, I'll give you the story real quick.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:42.260]   It was, I think on Thursday, some anonymous person uploaded to CNN's iReport website, a
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.620]   so-called first person report.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.100]   I just, I'm at the Apple campus.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.900]   I just saw Steve Jobs hustled off in an ambulance.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.300]   He's had a massive heart attack.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   No vetting.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   Nothing.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.540]   CNN's site, the stock tanks, of course, and goes, I don't know how many, it's three or
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.540]   four percent, right?
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.980]   A huge amount before somebody at CNN thinks to call Apple and Katie Cotton, Apple spokesperson
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.060]   says, no, he's sitting right there.
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.060]   He's fine.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.300]   It was completely bogus.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   Now everybody in their brothers saying, see, we told you citizen journalism sucks.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.300]   You know, I don't know.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.700]   It's just because it went through iReport.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:19.700]   It's kind of different.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.980]   Yeah, it was a citizen journalist reporting this to CNN, but they really should have
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.700]   vetted it before they published it.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.580]   That's who's to blame here, CNN, you think?
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.580]   Absolutely.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.340]   You know, I wrote a very extensive column in last Friday's Market Watch about this specific
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.340]   episode with the numbers and what's happened.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.100]   10 percent, Apple lost 10 percent of values.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.580]   Yeah, and we didn't gain to 10 percent, five minutes later.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.900]   It was the fastest move in 15 minutes, I think that Apple's ever had.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.900]   SEC's investigating though, because what a great way to, you short Apple, you put that
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.700]   rumor out.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.980]   Apple stock tumbles, you sell it in your back.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.300]   They'll never find the guy.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.580]   If the guy, if this was a stock scam, I'm sure it went through proxies, they'll never
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.580]   figure it out.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.580]   That's what they say.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:01.020]   In fact, same guy tried to place the same story of Mac rumors and Mac rumors turned it
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.860]   down because he was using a proxy because they couldn't identify him.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.340]   They had the good sense to say, we're not going to publish that.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.900]   What are you crazy?
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.900]   Mm.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:17.540]   It's what it really shows to me is that mainstream media, when it attempts to be cool and hip,
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.660]   completely fumbles it.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.500]   They don't get it, they don't understand.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.780]   This I report thing is, you know, they get it and they understand, they just don't apply
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:30.740]   anything that would be remotely considered standards or responsibility.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.460]   They threw out the standards and practices book.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.460]   So what do you do, John?
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.700]   What's the fix for this?
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:41.140]   I think you have people that are reasonable and sharp technologists that know how these
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.340]   things work and they like the guys that you said, the rumor site, they look at the proxy,
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.380]   they say, this thing's kind of phony.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.380]   And this happens all the time.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.140]   It's a stock scam thing, you know, pumps and dumps and all these other kinds of tricks.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   And that's what you need.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.100]   They obviously are just like sucking anything.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.940]   This is like these newspapers that they like to Washington Post did this for a while.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.540]   First they let people do commenting.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:06.940]   Then people comment and they get really nasty and they say, oh, our writers don't like
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:07.940]   it.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.940]   So they stop all the commenting.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.940]   Then they implement it again but make you register.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.220]   And then they leave those things slightly, they never moderate.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.820]   I mean, the guys who do blogging today, I think have got more on the ball than people
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.740]   running these newspapers and news organizations when it comes to internet related stuff.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.100]   Well, you know, yeah, I think synoced journalism is a great thing.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.180]   I think it gives an opportunity to see a lot of stuff out there that the major news organizations
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:31.420]   might not have a chance to cover or see, you know, they have people.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.940]   Or worse, maybe filtering, maybe, maybe hiding.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.940]   True.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:40.540]   But I think CNN at this point definitely had a responsibility to check with their sources
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.540]   and to double check.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:45.060]   They have the ability to call Apple and find out the truth.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.060]   A lot of citizen journalists don't have that ability.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.900]   So they probably before they started reporting on that should have taken that step.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.740]   Or maybe they should just have a button that they put on it that says unconfirmed or, you
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:02.700]   know, just a warning because, you know, the thing is it's different if it's on a CNN site,
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.660]   then people take it with a little more certainty.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.860]   So CNN has a higher responsibility to vet it.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860]   Very true.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.700]   Just say, unvetted.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   This is unconfirmed.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.340]   This is a rumor.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.220]   It went on dig.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.220]   I love this.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.820]   Then our friends at 4chan, the Lulls kids decided to promote it as a prank.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.100]   They knew it was bogus, but they really promoted it.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.700]   This is the same place where Sarah Palin's email accounts, contests and content and password
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.100]   were posted for Chan.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.980]   I think 4chan, increasingly, you're hip in young Veronica.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.380]   You must be in touch with this whole thing.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   You love the LOL cast.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.140]   You win it for the LOLs.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.660]   You're doing it for the LOLs.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:44.180]   We mocked this when New York Times did a whole story on it.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.940]   As if this is some sort of movement.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   It's 4chan.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   It's a forum.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.300]   It's not a movement.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.300]   It's kind of a movement.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.300]   I wouldn't deny that.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.300]   Is it a movement?
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.300]   Anything.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.300]   I mean, anonymous is out there.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.300]   That's a movement.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.300]   That came from 4chan.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   Anonymous came from 4chan.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.740]   I would definitely classify them as a movement of some kind.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.420]   It's not a movement.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.940]   I, you can't deny the power that they have.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:09.940]   Power is power.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.940]   It's a movement.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.460]   I mean, it's like saying George Bush has got a lot of power.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.620]   He's not a movement.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.980]   No, he's not a movement.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.820]   There are, but I guess when I, let me think how I could say this.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   How would I?
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.420]   One person is in a movement, necessarily.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.420]   No.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:27.140]   How would I characterize this?
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:35.060]   It's a movement if you've got a place where people gather and in concert attempt to create
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:39.100]   pranks like this, or maybe not pranks.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.300]   I don't know if the anonymous movement, the anti-scientology movement would be considered
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   a prank.
