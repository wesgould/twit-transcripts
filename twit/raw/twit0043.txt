[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   This Week in Time.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   This is Twit, this Week in Tech.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.900]   Episode 43 for February 26th, 2006.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   (Music)
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   And on the, this is kind of fun. The first time we've used ISDN for it to a Doug K of IT Conversations
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   It will.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400]   Happens to have a Zephyr as do I.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   And that's why Doug sounds like he's in the same room. Plus he has the same microphone.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   He had pretty much the same setup.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400]   Yeah, pretty much we could both make the same mistakes.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   (Laughs)
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   And we have.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   (Laughs)
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Yeah, except that you made them first and then I should be learning from what you're, you've been doing this for years.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.400]   Yeah, Doug was just in Hawaii. Were you acquiring more Hawaiian shirts?
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   I was. That's part of the ritual. It makes it an deductible trip, doesn't it?
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   I think it should. I was famous for my wacky shirts until Peter Hammersley, the executive producer at Tech TV.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   I thought, you know, whatever charm the show had with those shirts, I can't imagine why they'd kill it.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   Why would they stop?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   It was not great shirts.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   That was my trademark. So go back to it now.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   I'm going to because nobody can stop me.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400]   Except now I have to re-acquire.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   But I'll actually, you should take a picture of the shirt you're wearing during each twit and post that on the wall.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   (Laughs)
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   Make it visual.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   That's Patrick Norton blowing his nose in the background.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.400]   Allergy season is here and a beautiful noise in California and he's suffering.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   I forgot how bad your allergies were.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   Well, they're either non-existent or they're completely out of control.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   Is it grass? What is it you're allergic to?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Pretty much anything that generates pollen.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   So most of what's healthy in the world generates oxygen for the atmosphere.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   Trit my allergies.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   What makes us feel good kills poor Patrick Norton.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   (Laughs)
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   He's allergic to nothing except idiots and the author of the fabulous Devorak Uncensored Devorak.org/blog
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   off to Germany.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Actually, first to Orlando.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Yeah, the PMA show, the Photo Marketing Association.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   Have you been to that before?
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Yeah, I used to go every two years to give the same exact speech.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   In fact, this year was on the cycle.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   The speech was, "film is dead."
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   But now that film is dead, they don't call me back to do the speech anymore.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   (Laughs)
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   They know it!
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   I did it for about a decade.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   It was pretty funny.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   (Laughs)
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   John, you're really a master of efficiency.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Why rewrite when you couldn't...
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   So film finally died.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   You were right.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   I went to PMA last year.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   I went to Robin Liss of Camp Quarter Info.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   We did some video there.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   It's a fun show.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   It's a moderately sized show.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   It's not huge, but it's big.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   All the camera guys are there and they're showing all the newest stuff.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   If you like cameras, it's pretty cool.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   It was a film show.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   It was the Photo Marketing Association.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   It really was film and cameras and photographer stuff.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   Now it's digital.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Well, they had this little side show that was called a digital camera marketing associate.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Something like that was started with a D.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   It was part of the same organization, but they kind of did this little show on the side.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   That's how they started.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   The DCMA.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Yeah, it was very confusing, actually.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   Right.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   Then you turned out to eventually they just said, "I don't think they do the two separate anymore."
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   No, it's the same.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   It's the same show.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   And then you're from Florida, you're going on to Hanover.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   And you're going to Seabit, which is a big German trade show.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   I go to that every couple of years too.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   I can't really don't like going every year because it's kind of a miserable show.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   It's huge.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   It's like a world's fair.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   They have pavilions.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   It's not like the thing in Vegas.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   These are like a permanent world's fair.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   It's got buildings.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   Lots of buildings.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   They've got a bus system that runs between the buildings.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   It's like going to a world's fair.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   It's huge.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   It's enormous.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   It tends to still be kind of German-centric as opposed to world class.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   So it's kind of annoying in that regard.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   But it's like a big German trade show.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   So this is a really funny phrase.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   It tends to be German-centric instead of world class.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Not that the Germans have ever brought us any achievements in cars, optics, or warfare.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Well, what I mean by that, Patrick, of course, is that everyone speaks German.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   They don't care about the international audience.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   And so, I mean, they're basically just selling to dealers in Germany.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   So, anyway, but if anybody picks up this broadcast and they want to send me an email,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   and if they got some cool product they want me to check out, I'm going to go to Berlin after that,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   and I could use it to work.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   Berlin is amazing, City.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   John at Devorak.org.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   You've been to Berlin before, John?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   No, actually, I've been meaning to go to Berlin every time I go to Hanover,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   because it's only like an hour and a half on the train.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   And I just keep not doing it.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   I keep heading someplace else.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   And this time I'm going for sure.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   So I'm going to be a couple of nights in Berlin.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   I wonder how much Berlin has mellowed in the last decade.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   Well, everybody who's been there, it says it's one of the coolest places on the planet right now.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   There's some really neat stuff.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   I was spent the day there this summer with my son, and it's really an interesting city.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Of course, the wall is completely gone, but there's a line in the street where you can follow the path of the wall.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   Go to the Brandenburg Gate, of course.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   I mean, that's an amazing thing to see, and a lot of history there.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   And the Reichstag has an incredible...
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   On the roof of the Reichstag is an incredible kind of open greenhouse kind of thing
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   with an amazing view, a spiral walkway, and an amazing view up there.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   I've got a little piece of the wall.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   You have a piece of the wall, so do I.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Somebody give me a piece of the wall.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   I have a chunk too.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   You go to Checkpoint Charlie, they have the old...
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   There's what's it called? Charlie House, where it was a kind of a rescue operation for people who had gotten over the wall
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   for a long time.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   And of course, once the wall fell, it's now like a museum of the wall.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   It was a museum back in '86 when I was over there.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   Actually, a bunch of us actually managed to liberate a brick and break some pieces off the wall to break the back.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   So you've got the right way.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   You've got it by breaking down the wall.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   We actually bought it in case of plastic.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   You know, at one of the Microsoft cafeterias, I can't remember which segment of the campus it's on,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   but there's a piece of the wall that, apparently, I think was the Prime Minister
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   or the head of Mercedes Benz or somebody gave Bill as a gift.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   And it's this whole section of the wall.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   Wow.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   You know, that's like about a story high, and it's got all the graffiti and stuff on it.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   And it's sitting in the cafeteria.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   It's actually quite an interesting piece of art.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   Is your piece dug must be painted, right?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   Because every piece I've seen has a lot of paint on it.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   Yeah, I mean, my piece is a tiny little thing in a baggie.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Right.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   I shouldn't even get the plastic chunk of the wall.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   David Prager has joined us also from another...
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   another video podcast, this thing called, "Rivision3.com."
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   Hello, David.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   Hey there.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   Good to have you.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   Welcome.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   Thank you much.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   Kevin Rose is supposed to join us, but you can stand in for him.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   Okay.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   Because I'm going to ask him about digs suing all these people.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Oh, dig suing people for intellectual property?
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   Great.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   So he's going to plead ignorance.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   Well, look, but, you know, first of all, there's...
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   Well, we'll talk about it in a little bit.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   Prager doesn't work for dig.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   I know.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   So he can...
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   He's not probably the right person to ask.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   Now, Woz was going to join us.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   He may still join us because I wanted to ask him.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   He gave an interview to the Globe and Mail and he was kind of
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   critical of Apple.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   We'll talk about that a little bit too, but we'll wait until they
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   join us before we get into that.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   Have you actually heard from Kevin today at all?
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   I haven't.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   He said he was available, but not...
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   No.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   Next Sunday, I should announce this also.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   We're going to...
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   John, you won't be there.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   I'm sorry to say you'll be in...
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   in Hanover.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   But next Sunday or next Friday, I should say March 3rd, we're going to
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   be doing the show live from the Apple Store.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   So, Woz has said he joined us for that.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   So that'd be fun.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   That'll be pretty exciting.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   I got lucky to get out of that one.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   You don't want to be there?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   They'd stone you.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   At least currently.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   I didn't even close over.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   Let's put it that way.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   Now, one of the biggest articles on dig.com right now is somebody,
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   I guess, has written a point-by-point, point-by-point, you know,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   point-by-point refuting every single thing you posit in that
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   article.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.200]   And I keep running into Mac people that I know that no
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   I know you.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   And they're like, "It works just to believe that, doesn't it?
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   It's just, it's just to the column.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   You just like to agitate people."
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   I'm like, "Yeah, every, you know, six to 12 weeks."
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   John goes, "I haven't pissed off the entire apple-loving
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   community in a few weeks.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   I could use a couple hundred extra thousand hits on this column."
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   And it's just, but people are like, "People are like, "He doesn't
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   believe that, doesn't he?"
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   I'm surprised anybody would take the time to do a point-by-point
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   refutation.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   That's what cracks me up.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   It shows you how psychopathic somebody's going.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   It's just nuts.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Why spend the energy on that?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   I mean, it's only just, you know, it's a consideration.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   Somebody wrote me something nasty and I said, "You know, it's not
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   like I'm on the board of apple suggesting this and you should
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   be yelling at it."
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   Right, right.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   It's just a column.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   It's just a column.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Now, February 28th is Tuesday.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Apple is going to make a big announcement.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   And I think that's exactly what they're going to announce.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   What do you think they're going to announce?
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   They're going to have a big break.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   They're going to show shipping windows.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   Have you seen the pictures that are new iPod?
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Yeah, I have.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   I don't know how real they are.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   Let me tell a story and...
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I just heard it was an announcement of something fun.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   Yeah, let me tell a story and we can see if we can decipher.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   I mean, it's kind of...
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   There's very cryptic.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   I got the email myself that says, "It's just got a little
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   I-Cal picture, February 28th, 2006."
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   And it says, "This is all.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   It's just eight words, but everybody is reading into this
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   eight words amazingly.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   Come see some fun new products from Apple."
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   That's all it says.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   Now, we're going to go down there.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   I'm going to go down with a camera crew and we're going to
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   cover it.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   But it could just be iPod socks version two.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   Fun new products.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   It doesn't sound big.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   Any thoughts from anybody?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   The speculation.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   There's so little information to work on.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   It's like semiotics.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   You're trying to understand what could they have meant by fun.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   What do they mean by products?
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.200]   Fun new products?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   It's a video player.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   That's what...
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   And then Gadget had a picture very similar to the picture.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   Of the video iPod.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   Except the whole thing is a display and it's touch screen.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   Touch screen.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   And you feel that that's accurate?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   David, or do you have inside information?
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   I don't have inside information, but that's what everyone
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   that thinks that they have accurate information.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   I don't know what I'm thinking.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   I think it's a high-fied boombox arriving next week
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   amongst the other products.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   I bet you it'll have Wi-Fi also.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Here's my thinking.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   Here's my thinking.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   I think you're exactly right, David.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Apple's talking about media hub.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   I think people are saying it's going to be a Mac Mini media hub.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   But what if it were an iPod media hub with built-in Wi-Fi,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   the ability to store and playback pictures, video and audio?
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   And purchase it wirelessly.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   And purchase it wirelessly and play it back wirelessly.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   And subscribe to Twitch.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   And subscribe.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Wouldn't that be an interesting product?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   Well, that would be one of the things you'd be able to do.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   Right?
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   And get all the free stuff as well.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   Ask an Inja.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Right.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   But you know, we're going to see RSS clients in this stuff.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   So you're going to be able to actually not only put your podcast on your portable device,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   but even manage your subscriptions there.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   Screw the RSS.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   I want BitTorrent.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   There you go.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   It won't play WMV.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   No, I think we can safely say that's not in the fun new product category.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   The other thing that's I think probably a very possible bet is a media center Mac Mini.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   I mean, they're due for the new Mac Mini.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   They're not due for a new iPod.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   It could be a new iBook.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   Could be an iBook.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   Then no, it's no.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   It's a fun new product, right?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   iBooks are fun, especially in the shape like toilet seats.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   You know, it seems to me that every time Apple farts, everybody gets on.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   I know it's amazing.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Let's go on to some other topic.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   I mean, who cares what it is until after they show it.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   And then it's going to be like overblown when it rolls out.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   We'll be talking about this for a month.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   All right.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   I think you're probably right.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   I do think it's very interesting that people are just going on and on trying to read into these eight words.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   You know, what it could possibly be.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   We're going to go to a Mac break.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   It's going to take a camera crew down there.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   We'll have the same day coverage.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   And if it's iPod socks, won't we be embarrassed?
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   What do you think of this new Skype version?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   You know, 2.0 with video?
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   I haven't tried it.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   Have you tried it?
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   I haven't tried it.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   I know that they used to be a plug-in, a third-party company made for video to work on Skype.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   For you know, it's called.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   Right.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   But now you can do it for real on Windows, but not on the Mac.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   So I'm actually using Skype on the Mac right now.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   I know you're all on Windows.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   Actually, a friend just got a new T-Mobile selling a new Windows Mobile cell phone.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   It's called the MDA that has -- this is a cell phone, but it has Wi-Fi in it, Windows Mobile.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   And he's running -- he puts Skype for Pocket PC on there.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   And you have to overclock it because it clocks in about 200 megahertz, but you overclock it a little bit.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   It runs Skype.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   And he's able to on his T-Mobile cell phone make Skype calls via Wi-Fi.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   And he can fry eggs on a T-Mobile?
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   He probably can't.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   It probably gets hot enough when you're overclocking it.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   Yeah, the problem is the 12-volt battery you need to keep running for more than an hour.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   Yeah, it's kind of a -- it's a neat-looking phone, but it doesn't -- you know, again, the problem with these smartphones, they don't have dial pads.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   It's like the sidekick.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   It's like the phone functionality is second to everything else.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   Okay, news.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   News? That's news.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   That's all news.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   Everything we just mentioned is news.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Should we do the 32 Google stories that have come out?
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   All right, Google's made it in the news a lot.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   So, okay.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   Google's made another small announcement, Google Base, where they can use link credit cards through Google accounts, do purchasing with people are predicting that it's Google's shot across the bow of PayPal and eBay.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   So, they're finally doing that to those transactions that they were promising, huh?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   How do I do that?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   I have a Google account.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   Do I go to googlebase.com or what --
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   Would you have a Gmail account or do you have a Google account?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   What they're doing is they're allowing certain people to start selling stuff through Google Base.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Okay.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   So, Google Base is now becoming the eBay killer that people were worried it was going to become.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   Slash Craigslist.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   They also announced a content creator, a web design engineer, to compete with Yahoo's GeoCities and all that.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   Boy, is it land?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   Did you try it?
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   I know.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   It was just useless.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   My son looked at it and equated it with the first AOL web thing that they dreamed up.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   Really?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Yeah, just bad.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Well, and ironically, it was so popular that they had to close it after the first day because so many people signed up for it.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   Well, you guys, do you guys have a readuser friendly.org?
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   The cartoon.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   There's been a really great series where, where, uh, Ilya had been making fun of people who were completely oblivious.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   You know, they're like, "Oh, Google's going to give away our information."
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   It's like, "Well, Google is already selling your information."
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   The writing joke is like, "Oh, great. Why do I sign up?"
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   There's this whole series of cartoons where they're kind of taking the piss out of Google and its reputation and the fact that anything they do to everybody signs up.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   Half the planet wants to sign up.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   Google's like Apple in that respect.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   I mean, we just talked about two companies in a row that really generate more attention than they deserve.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   I mean, Apple just has to, you know, say hi there and everybody says, "What?" and Google's the same thing.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   Well, I think Apple wants everyone to say what when they say hi there.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   Google does, but sometimes they would like to be able to do so without having everyone go nuts.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   Now, I just logged on to pages.google.com, which is the page creator.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   So apparently it's open again.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   Although I just had a, I've never seen this, an error message from Google says, "Google, oops.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Google Page Creator is having a little trouble right now.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   This is not because of anything you did.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   It's just a little hiccup in our system that will hopefully go away soon."
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   We apologize like that.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   We apologize for the inconvenience.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   I recommend you try reloading the page.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Let me try reloading the page.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   Well, it does, Leo.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   It's going to create a website using your Google mail name.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   Right.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   And I'm sure they have lots of applications for it.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   I can't think of a single one.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Well, it's just space.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   Competing with MySpace or with Yahoo or with a meet.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   And it's supposed to actually implement Ajax style stuff in there, which is a pretty big step, I think, if they make it work for end users.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   It does have, it is doing character by character feedback to the host, apparently.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   So it's got some really high interactivity features, but it's not quite sure what those are yet.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   Well, and as bullet point number one, no technical knowledge required.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   Or maybe we're just snobs.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   Maybe people need something like this.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   It looks like front page from 10 years ago.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   You can pick from a couple of dozen templates and you can make this look.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   And so where are you?
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   But, you know, again, yeah, there's maybe there is a business model in the MySpace kind of world.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   So we do have, I can't remember what our, is it Twit@Google@gmail.com or TwitTV@gmail.com?
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   I think that's it.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   So I should sign up for TwitTV.Google pages.com.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   Maybe, maybe I shouldn't have done this redesign.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   I could just use a Google template.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   No, nobody thinks so.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   Nobody thinks so.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   It's not as done by the way and now I have to implement it.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   Oh, God.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   It looks great.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   I don't want to give out the address on the show because I don't know.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   It's not an art service yet.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   It was a sign on a service.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   I didn't think the old design was that bad.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   Well, the only problem with the old designers is very blog focused.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   So this is, this has a blog still in it and I hope you guys will participate in the blog, but it's more like a network page where you see all the shows on the front page and all the new shows on the front page.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   It's a little clearer about where the shows are and what the latest version is and all that stuff.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   Doug, you have about how many different IT conversations pages do you have?
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   Well, it's sort of automated.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   So we have one page certainly for every program and we're just about to hit a thousand programs in the archive.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   A thousand.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   Yeah, we're doing about 10 to 12 a week right now and we'll be doing 60 programs a week by the end of the year.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   You just did Steve Gibson?
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   That was our very maggot that interviewed Steve.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   And you just let me know that the most popular, what do you think guys, the most popular IT conversation interview of all time was?
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   They've interviewed everybody.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   Adolph Hitler?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   No, not yet.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   Maybe when you go to Berlin, John, you can snag an interview with him and that would be, I'm sure, very popular.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   No, Wozniak.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   Really?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Yeah, Woz gave a great presentation at NOMDEXA.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   You're in a half ago, very popular and we did a follow-up interview with him right afterwards and that is now been downloaded a little over 150,000 times which by our standards is pretty high.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   That's great.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   So AOL has voted an interesting stunt.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   I guess this is one way to get rid of your dial-up customers.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   They've raised the price of AOL dial-up, which was already exorbitant, to $25.90 a month.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   It's the same as the broadband price.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   I remember when $25.95 a month would have been cheap for 56K access.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   But that was a while ago.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   300K access.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   It was a long time ago.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   20?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   There's still a lot of people that can't get brought back.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Well, I'm wondering, I mean, it seems like, you think it's that or they're trying to get rid of these guys?
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   Nobody in the right mind wants to get rid of free money.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   Well, it can't be costing them that much to maintain the dial-up centers.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   AOL Spokeswoman Ann Bentley said Tuesday, "Hopefully it's an encouragement for them to get high-speed connections."
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   I wonder if it's a possibility that people who are locked into their AOL addresses and want the ability to access while they're on the road.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   Is it the mobile access thing?
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Let's get the latest on Blackberry.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   RIM had a victory in the patent office the day before their hearing on Friday.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   The US Patent and Trademark Office said that one of the, I think there's four NTP patents, one of them was invalidated.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   So that would be, you would think, good news.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.200]   Although the judge apparently in the RIM case, the US judge is not well disposed towards Blackberry at all.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   James R. Spencer heard the case on Friday.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   What was the upshot of the hearing?
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   I didn't hear.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   I was in on a plane from Canada.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   I think that he, first of all, he was pretty pissed at the whole patent process.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   And he was basically saying that this, he said this thing first of all should have been handled out of court.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   That it should never have gotten that far.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   And I think he's...
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   He's mad that he's even has to waste any time on this.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Well, that's a great phrase.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   And he also said that he feels that the patent process has stifled innovation.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   I wouldn't blame Blackberry on this, uh, uh, uh, Patrick.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   They refused to.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   And then they made the people who apparently have the rightful patent, fight them through the system.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   And then they ended up with their stock price and their entire customer base over a barrel as a result.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Well, but we don't know, uh, this is what Blackberry's, what RIM is saying is, well, it wasn't the money.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   Now, of course, this is revisionist.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Maybe this is just the latest.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   But what, and I agree with you that I think the NTP, I have now come around to thinking, and John,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   how the money was the principal of the patent?
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   John said all along the NTP patent was legit.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   And after reading all of the detail on it, it does sound like that's a legit patent.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   No, Blackberry was saying, RIM was saying, uh, it's not the money.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   It's that we don't want our business process encumbered in the future.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   And we, NTP wasn't giving us, uh, you know, wasn't saying, yeah, just license it.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   They were saying, no, we want to kind of, you know, they weren't being clear on what else they wanted.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   In other words, and I can understand that.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   And if you're trying to run a business, uh, once, one thing to license the technology,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   another thing to have this company have its thumbs in your business all the time.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   Well, supposedly they've got to work around all, I'm a Blackberry user.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   And they sent out email to everyone saying, you know, just in case we have a solution.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   Yeah, you know what the work around is?
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   The Department of Justice, the U.S. Congress, major industry, all of them run on Blackberry.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   There's no way.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   You know that there, it was intense pressure on the patent and trademark office to invalidate this patent.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   I mean, I'm sure every Congressman, every, I mean, the Department of Justice runs on these things.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   Uh, I'm sure President Bush carries a Blackberry.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   Uh, I don't think he really carries a communication.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   No, he just went back to the trio 650 after he didn't want the 700.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   He has people that can do that kind of thing.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   I think he might be a sidekick user.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   I think he likes to, I am with his buds.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   We're just being silly.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   You're probably right.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   Now that's an interesting question, though.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   Does the President carry a cell phone?
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   Oh, gosh.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   He's got a...
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   He's got six or 12 personal assistants to be cell phone.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   The President carries a cell phone that would make it very easy to target him, I guess.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   It's really creative devices.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Oh, he doesn't... he's got a bunch of guys.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   That's what I just said.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   In the time...
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   I know, but I wasn't listening.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   No, I'm not listening.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   In the time that you guys were chatting that up, I did a webpage on Google and posted it.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   It's online.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   It took that long to create a page from scratch.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   So, John's been web designing during the show.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   I'm on the web right now at thevorak.googlepages.com/home.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   But, now, so you didn't get that error message I did?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   No, I got a page posted on the Internet as we speak.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   You put a picture of the sky up there.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   Thevorak's full homepage.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   This is a test of how fast it is to...
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   Hey, it's beautiful, too.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   And click here for a second.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   It looks better than Google video.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   It looks a lot better than Google video.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   It's colorful.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   Yeah, well, that's for sure.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   And look, it points to Twit TV.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   Thank you, John.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Hey, that's great.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   That's nice.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   Okay, now I've got to do that.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   Okay, talk amongst yourselves.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   I'm going to go to design a webpage.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   No, hey, you know, now you're just doing a copycat.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   I mean, the patent trademark market has office, G's, trademark office, actually.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   I guess they have, since you're rejected, all but three of the patents in it.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   There's three left.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   There's three left.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   They will invalidate them as well.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   No.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   I think that's political.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Don't you think that's political at this point?
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   Of course it's political.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   It's, you know, if the patents legal and legit having it invalidated at this point, that's
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   a little strange.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   I haven't read it.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   I haven't been to the patent.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   I guess the stuff the person that runs the patent trademark office pointing out just how
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   it's messy.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   It is.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   They've been done a series of interview clips on your own.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   They're talking about how they just think it's, you know, she's made, I mean, I can't
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   imagine she's going to be allowed to stay in that office very long.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   Here's the onions list of how people are going to respond to the Blackberry service shutdown.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   Keep frantically hitting send until service returns.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Attempt to contact broker on astral plane through right combination of incense cocaine and
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   fat and calf sacrifice.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   Three, commit useless information to memory.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   That's what we had to do in the old days.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   Imagine what happens when, you know, eight million people like me walk back into their singular
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   office and say, hi, I bought this and it doesn't work.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Imagine what they're going to have to deal with.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   It can't happen.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   Email from PC using only thumbs and attempt to recapture awesome Blackberry feeling.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   Focus all metal powers on finding loophole in lawsuits so they can reclaim machines that
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   remind them when to eat lunch.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   This is my favorite.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   What will the and the number one thing Blackberry users will have to do when services shut down.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   Look where they're going.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   I love that.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   Onion is fine.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   Right.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   We got a slow news.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   It is slow.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   I have to apologize to the listeners in advance.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Why is that?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   They get mad at us when we don't have a lot of cool stuff to talk about.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   I think we should just start every tweet with an apology.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Then we wouldn't have to worry.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   This is Twitter.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   We're sorry.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   Did you already talk about YouTube and how networks are getting pissed about their property going
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   virally all over the web?
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   NBC should be on their knees thanking YouTube.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   Where did YouTube come from?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   I had not heard of them.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   YouTube banned?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   No, YouTube.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   We talked about them last week too.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   Why are you TUBE.com?
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   No, I noticed that I got two or three things today from people sending me from the YouTube.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   Everybody's solidified either.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   They're on the top 200 websites according to Alexa.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   Oh, but who uses Alexa?
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   That's absurd.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   People who have five tractal.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   Alexa is probably the biggest name.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   People who want numbers that don't understand that Alexa is a self-serving group of people
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   that actually use Alexa.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   Alexa numbers aren't that bad.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   I've tested them.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   Really?
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   But you have to use Alexa to bar.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   They're not the money.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   They're not.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   They're not.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   It's still numbers.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   It's not as low.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   So you think relative, but the relative ranking is right.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Just not the actual number.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   Because you have to use the Alexa to bar.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   They don't really give you real numbers.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   They give you kind of rankings.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   Ranking.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Well, that would make sense.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:24.720]   So YouTube, of course, was where Lazy Sunday, the great rap clip from Saturday Night Live
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.200]   first appeared and people were sending them around all over the place.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.760]   NBC got a lot of mileage out of it.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.200]   In fact, they became so popular.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   They tried to turn around and sell it on the Apple iTunes music store for a Buck 99, which
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.120]   was kind of silly since everybody already had it for free.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   And then they try to pull it off YouTube.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   There's some good stuff on there I have to say.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   They should be grateful.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   That's ridiculous.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   There's a lot of sites like that that have a lot of copyrighted material that's been posted
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   in the Not-A-Control Google video.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   You can probably find the Lazy Sunday on Google video like that.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   You probably could still find it on YouTube.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   What I loved was all the Lazy Sunday ripoffs.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   Not ripoffs, but almajas.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   Everybody from 11-year-old kids.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   I mean, it's just been hysterical.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   So you were up in Canada, Leo.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   What do you think about this crackpot university president who's banned Wi-Fi because he thinks
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   it might cause cancer at Lakehead?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   That cracked me up.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   I saw that.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   Lakehead University, they're worried about the "health effects" of wireless networking.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   We're not inundating with this stuff.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   I just hope nobody's studying science at this university because they might want to think
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   again.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.120]   Somebody's saying, "I blog this item on devork.org/blog."
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   There's your plug.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   And somebody sent in a comment, "Lakehead University, aka Last Chance U."
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   I guess so.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   Can't get anywhere.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   Well, you know, in Canada, the university education is very inexpensive.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   I mean, McGill is like $1,700 a year.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   And McGill's a great school.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   It's a very good school.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   So...
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   State.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   I mean, I state by the federal government of Canada, right?
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   And then Thunder Bay, which is kind of off the beat, a little off the beaten track.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   Beautiful area.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   A little cold in the winter.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.560]   That's where Lakehead is.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.240]   I was stunned when I saw that article in the Globe and Mail and I thought, "That is unclear
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.760]   on the concept."
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.840]   They also, in their defense, they mentioned security issues.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.680]   But I think it really was more about the "health issues."
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.240]   Yeah, but Canada's got curling.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.920]   There's a video on YouTube of a bunch of curlers that are doing what's apparently the
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.280]   most impossible move ever.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.320]   I have no idea what's going on, but they're cheering like crazy to commentators going nuts.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.720]   And it's spreading around like crazy.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.320]   I can't believe that this show has descended to curling commentary.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   How come I'm curling?
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.720]   Hey, you're from Canada, eh?
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   Let me just see.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.920]   I'll give you the results of the curling.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.120]   I've got another one here.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   The Finn one.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120]   The Finn one.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   The Finn one.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   I believe.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.320]   I've got the new couch potato definition.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.520]   That's sitting at home watching curling on TV.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.420]   Not even real-time watching.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.520]   I think watching Texas hold them is worse.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.720]   A lot of people doing that.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.520]   They're fast forward.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   How is curling any less boring than golf?
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.320]   If you've played curling, whatever, do you call it playing?
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   I don't even know what you call it.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Cool.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:18.120]   If you've curled, if you've thrown a curl, if you've stoned, it's a fun game to play.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.720]   I'm not sure I'd want to watch.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   Have you done it?
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.520]   What are you just saying?
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.020]   I'm just saying it's a fun game.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.520]   I'm saying it looks like it's fun.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.120]   It's people who I know who've curled say it's fun.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.520]   Canada took the gold and the United States took bronze.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   Canada did take the gold.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   Oh, good.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   That's appropriate.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   As it should be.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   Because they can both...
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.520]   The Canadian's lost in hockey.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.720]   Both Canada and US lost in hockey.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.520]   Who won the checks, right?
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.120]   No, the Russians played for the bronze medal and the checks won, I believe.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.520]   The gold medal is between the Finns and the Swedes.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520]   That's right.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.520]   The Finnish look like they are unbeatable.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   Yes, it's Twi...
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   Twi Olympic news.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   I could play the...
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.720]   Let's go to another topic.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   This is on my blog again.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.120]   "Fans set up church of SpongeBob."
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.720]   Is that a tech story?
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   Yes, it's on the internet.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   Do you have a problem with that, Jan?
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   I think it's...
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   I'm joining.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.120]   So, we were supposed to have Kevin on.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.420]   I wish he had come on because I would like to have asked him about the fact that dig.de,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.880]   which was basically a copy of dig and a pretty direct copy, has now renamed itself to
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:33.400]   YIG.de to avoid legal battle with Dig Incorporated.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.320]   Apparently because Dig has now gone to Europe and has registered the trademark, nobody else
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   can beat Dig.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.840]   Well, I just went there.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.160]   If you type dig.de, you do go to YIG.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   YIG.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.760]   And it's exactly the same.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.880]   Instead of having 33 digs, you've got 33 Yigs.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   Yigs.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.200]   There's a bunch of sites that do that.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.160]   There's a bunch of tools that are like friends with types.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.440]   There's Pig, which is an open source dig.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440]   So I don't know.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.640]   Kevin's going to have a tough time shutting down all the digs.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.000]   Do I know about Pig?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Is that pig.com?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Well, I think it's...
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I don't know if they have a pig.com, but it's the software.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.440]   And there are, I think, quite a few companies running...
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.040]   There are companies' sites running the pig software.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.360]   And that identity owns the pig.com site.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   Pig.com.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   And then there's...
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   It's a big thing.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   So, I don't know.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.200]   You know, there's a funny thing about this company.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   I never mind.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.000]   I'm not going to even bring it up.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.640]   Do they have two fat guys sitting on a couch drinking beer and call it Pig Nation?
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   Pig.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   The big nation video.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Pig Nation video.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   Have you looked at YIG.de, though?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.720]   I mean, it really does look exactly like.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   It's exactly the same.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.960]   There's no difference.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.280]   It's a blatant clone.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.640]   I can understand why Kevin will be a little upset.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.920]   It seems to be in a foreign language.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   It's in German.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   Oh, I've heard that.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.000]   You should learn that language if you're going to Berlin.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   That's as good.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   That's as good.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.600]   Venus, Nitzel, very important.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.960]   Those are all important things.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.160]   How do you say beer?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   Oh, beer.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   The idea.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   Not the un-lod of Nitzel.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   Gross.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   From the...
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.400]   From the Twit army, who fortunately...
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.840]   Somebody's been collecting stories.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   The Twit army's been collecting stories.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.240]   The Motion Picture Association of America is bringing lawsuits now, not against get
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   this.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.160]   They've gone beyond suing BitTorrent sites.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.400]   They're now suing sites that index binaries on news groups.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   What?
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:40.520]   Well, if you go to the news groups, it's going to be very hard for them to shut down the
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   news groups, obviously.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.840]   And if you go to the news groups and you go to the binaries groups, there's Alt.media.binary.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   Right.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.000]   They can taste it right.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.920]   Well, you can get movies, TV, it's actually a very good place to get these because it's
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.360]   faster than BitTorrent.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.880]   And anyway, I'm not going to go into too great detail.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.200]   But the key is how do you find it?
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   Well, there are sites that index these binary files, and so the MPAA is going against them.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:13.880]   So targeting nine indexing sites for BitTorrent, including ISO, Hunt, BT Hub, Torrent Box, Torrent
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   Spy.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.120]   I mean, they're going after these guys seriously.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.440]   I'm sorry, but you know, I've always noticed one thing.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.840]   Not that I'm recommending this to anybody.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.120]   But it seems to me that some of the best places to exchange these kinds of files is on the
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.440]   IRC.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.600]   That's what everybody does, right?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   Of course.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.400]   Yeah, I've talked to a number of guys who runs IRC servers and I asked them specifically
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.440]   if they've ever been, if anyone's even asked them about this kind of activity.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.720]   And one guy in particular told me, you know, if they ever came up and said anything to
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   us, we'd close down these rooms, these chat rooms, but no one's ever mentioned it.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.480]   They don't seem to, IRC seems to be completely, I don't know, they got free for some reason.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.200]   Maybe just so hard to figure out, you know, who it is and the chase after them.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   I don't know.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.000]   Well, so many of them are closed and you can just close one and create another one.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Right.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.840]   Yeah, it's very easy just to move along.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.240]   It's kind of like a rolling dice game, you know, it's hard to, hard to shut down.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.960]   Well, here's the story that I liked.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   Okay.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.080]   The industry news is about Yahoo doing content by putting on a new show and then using sock
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.280]   puppets as the anchorman.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280]   Did you see this?
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.400]   Yeah, that's practically to it right there.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.560]   That's our game plan.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.960]   We've already tried it.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   We did it.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   We did it first.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.840]   Sock puppets as anchors?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   Well, just puppets.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.800]   But they said early in this, apparently they held a new guy, Yahoo's Media Group.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.520]   He came up, ran this idea through at Pazazzo the company's internet news by creating a
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   show anchored by animated puppets.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   I have bad idea.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   What do you remember?
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   Ananova.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.640]   I might just go buy the naked news and get it over with, you know.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.640]   Ananova is a virtual character who does news and actually it's not too bad.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   You've seen the Ananova news.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   No, actually I never had a look at it.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   A and A.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   I'll actually know you.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.160]   Right, you're right, I have seen it.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   Yeah, it's actually okay.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.920]   Yeah, it's a decent news service.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   The naked news is better.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.280]   You know, that's done out of Toronto and I actually was thinking of going over and volunteering.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.640]   But are they still doing that?
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   How much does it cost?
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.440]   They'll drop their numbers radically.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.440]   Sell short.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.640]   You're asking me how much it costs?
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.960]   David, why would I know that?
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   I don't know.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.600]   I just remember you used to see, we watched a sample of it in one of the meeting rooms at
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.480]   Tech TV a long time ago.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   And we're blown away by its brilliance.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.240]   That was just so long ago.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.080]   I'm surprised if they're still going, but I guess probably still going because people
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   pay for it.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.560]   I don't get to free.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   Leo, get to free.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   I'm a special deal.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.720]   I have a special deal.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.960]   I have a green lighted, the sock puppet news.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.040]   It's the same guy that green lighted lost in Desperate Housewives at ABC.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   You see?
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   You see?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   It really went brown.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   Brilliant.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.240]   So maybe my pets.com dog can get a job.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.320]   I have one of those.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   I have one in the box.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   What are the original ones really?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   I have one in the box.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   I didn't keep it in the box.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.040]   I think buying like 10 of them in the box when they were selling them because they were
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.440]   given them with the end down there.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.360]   It's probably a good investment.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.680]   So this is, people remember pets.com which is the spectacular failure.com failure.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.200]   They had a sock puppet, a spokes dog, but they sold the sock puppet on the site.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   You could buy it.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   That was their only remaining asset.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   They had a bunch of money with the--
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   And then the sock puppet made commercials for a couple of other companies or other companies.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Did it really?
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.000]   Well, it was one of the insurance companies for people who couldn't get insurance.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.160]   The tagline was, "Everybody needs a second chance."
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.200]   Oh, that's great.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   It was the one good thing they did.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.360]   Kevin's online now.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   He changed his username.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   Oh.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.800]   But no, but he hadn't been online.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.400]   He told me he just logged on.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.760]   I told him that we were talking about and he said, "Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.760]   I got to get in there then."
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, the president of YIG.DE, Kevin Rose.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   Hello.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   Can you hear me?
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   Yeah, we hear you great.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   Yeah, we can hear you.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.280]   Hey, Kevin, I really like that YIG site in Germany.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   It's really cool.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   Nicely done.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   You did a great job with that.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   That's funny.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.720]   How did you guys hear about that?
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.280]   It was in the news.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.440]   Yeah, that's-- I think I probably read it on dig.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:24.040]   It's so funny because there's actually never been any communication from dig to YIG at
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.120]   any time.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.280]   So like these ideas of them freaking all out and saying we're going to sue them and say,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.680]   "I have no idea where that came from."
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   It was actually smart.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   That's a good way to get attention.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   It worked.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.360]   We've never even-- we've never even spoken with them on traded emails.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.840]   I would sue them, actually, because if you look at it, it looks just like dig.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.000]   You know, I understand that Kevin is going to sue me for the Devorak Uncensored blog at
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.160]   devorak.org/blog.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   I mean, I got a nasty note from him when I'm poking.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.640]   That's right.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.840]   And there is an open-- we were talking about-- is it Pig, the open source dig clone software,
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   too?
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.040]   There's clones like every other day that are popping up all over the place.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.360]   Do you care about it?
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.000]   No, the clones, you know, not so much.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.480]   But when someone takes your trademark and uses it at other places, you have to-- there's
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.320]   actually-- trademark law is kind of strange that you have to make sure that you have to
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   enforce it.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.560]   You have to defend it, yeah.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   Right.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   Otherwise, you lose it.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   Right.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.760]   So we figured you only reason you're coming on, Kevin, is because we're talking about
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   you.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Oh, no, no.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   I'm sorry, guys.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   I wish I could have made it earlier.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   How far along are you?
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Are you almost done?
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   Well, you know what?
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   We ran out of stories.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   So if you've got anything good to talk about, I'd love to hear it.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   Wow.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.960]   We're talking about the sock puppet that's going to do the news on Yahoo.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   That's how we're bad it's got-- Oh, no.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.760]   It's not the pet-- it's not the pets.com one, is it?
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.960]   Oh, although--
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   Weirdly enough, two of the commentators on this show actually have sock puppets.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.760]   And Doug K, who's on also for MIT Conversations, has his in the box.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   Sealed.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   Is it sealed?
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   It is.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   It's never been opened.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   That's hysterical.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   I checked eBay.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   You know, six months ago, I looked on eBay.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   I think it was worth about $14.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   Oh, that's a shank.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   I guarantee you're worth thousands.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   Someday.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:14.440]   The problem is you're fighting-- you're in a race against obscurity because nobody's
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.480]   going to remember this thing in a couple of years anyway.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.960]   There is one thing that I bought off of eBay that I will not sell for-- well, it depends
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   on what somebody offers.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.600]   But I do have a copy of Windows 1.0 Sealed.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   It's never been opened.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   That's good.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.640]   I think I got-- well, I don't know if it's top, but I got something that's pretty cool,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   too.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   What is it?
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.280]   I have a sealed, unopened box of Microsoft Bob.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   Oh!
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   You know, but I may still have a t-shirt.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.440]   I'll give you the match as that.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.880]   Okay, I got the t-shirt here.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.720]   I'll top you with this because I've got the Microsoft Bob hat, which is the same hat
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.800]   that Steven Spielberg wore when they announced DreamWorks.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.960]   He had one of those crazy-looking hats on.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   So I'm not even--
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   I'm in the box of crap.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   I got that.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   I can't believe it.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   Bob thing going, man.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   I heard a rumor.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   It's coming back in Vista.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   That's what they're saying.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   Bob is back.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   You missed him.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.360]   You've been wondering where he is.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   He's back.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Maybe the sock puppet can do the ads.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.000]   It'll be great.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.200]   The biggest comeback of all time.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   I already have a-- can't-- can Norton do it.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   It'll be good.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:22.280]   The buy it now price for a brand new inbox, pets.com sock puppet plush dog is $14.99.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.680]   Well, we are doing-- actually, I haven't mentioned this to you guys, but we are doing
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.800]   an eBay auction to benefit EFF.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.400]   And I didn't involve you guys in it, but it's not too late.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.960]   The auction will go up in a couple of weeks.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.760]   We remember we were in the Superman comic.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.000]   We had the hoods, the hoodlums who were stealing TVs in Superman.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   That's awesome.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   I saw that.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.600]   They have a Twit logo on-- a Hack 5 logo in Command N. We got the Hack Daren.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.760]   We got the Hack 5 team to autograph.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.160]   We have pristine copies sealed in plastic.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.400]   The Hack 5 guys have autographed it.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   I've autographed it.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.880]   Amber and Mike from Command N have autographed it.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.280]   I'd like to actually-- I'll circulate it among you guys too and get autographed.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.000]   We're going to put it on eBay to benefit EFF, so we're hoping to raise a little bit
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   of money.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.600]   We've got eight numbered signed copies of that comic.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   Excellent.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   That'll be fun.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:16.440]   I have a copy of Lotus Jazz, maybe.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.960]   Which one was the vaporware that-- was it jazz?
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.960]   No jazz shipped.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.560]   Which was the one that Lotus product that never did improv?
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   No.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.160]   Improv shipped for a while.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.960]   It was probably their best product.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   Improv was good.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.400]   I remember it was the first to do pivot tables.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.800]   Yeah, it was preform.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.960]   It was just the-- apparently the reason that thing never got anywhere was because it was
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:42.640]   always in-house, inner-neeseing kind of battling going on with these, you know, the old Lotus
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.480]   1, 2, 3 folks.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.120]   It's almost like the product at Adobe called InDesign, which was killed because of the
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.680]   Photoshop people didn't like it.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.320]   Well InDesign's now the number one page layout program on the program.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.880]   No, that's-- I'm sorry, image style.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.360]   Oh, I was going to say.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.240]   Image style was great.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.720]   You turned me on Image style.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.400]   That was a great little program.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   It still works.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.600]   I still use it for quick stuff.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.800]   Image ready has some of that functionality built into it.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.520]   Actually they've moved a lot of it to Photoshop and Illustrator.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.440]   You can do a lot of the stuff too, but you can't do it as fast.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.720]   It was a great rollovers and--
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.440]   Right, and the thing with load-- I mean you could load image style and get a little special
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.360]   effect finished and put on, you know, and save before Photoshop would even finish loading
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   the plugins.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.960]   That's the problem.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   Somebody just walked out on us, I think.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   This is Kevin.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.560]   Next to me is Sean Moore.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.200]   I got this off of Dig.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   Interesting.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.840]   It's the-- actually I'm sorry, it's from the Twit Army.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.440]   I'm talking about the dot grid on the printers, the Xerox docu-color printers.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.240]   Ah, yes, they keep you from counterfeiting.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   They keep you from counterfeiting.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Right.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   We've got-- there's a great link on EFF with all the decoding of all of these.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.560]   That's fine because there was a couple of kids busted recently and they got-- but you
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.280]   know, counterfeiters and I'm thinking, I don't think that many people know.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   I mean, if you think you're going to go out and counterfeit using your laser printer
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.920]   or any of these printers, you're making a big mistake because every one of them has
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   got a code.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   It's like a serial number that's on that paper.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   It's printed on the paper.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   I don't think that's such a bad idea, actually.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.760]   I mean the EFF's all up in arms about it, but I think that's--
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   You know what?
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.480]   I think it was-- I don't think people should be counterfeiting A and B.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.680]   You're right.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.920]   Because counterfeiting is such a problem with these printers, if they didn't do that,
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   you wouldn't get--
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.920]   You wouldn't get them.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   --they get colors on these printers.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   You wouldn't get them, yeah.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.680]   I mean, the reason that they went to it is because the printers were getting able to
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.240]   make these great copies that were perfectly accurate with color.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.280]   And so the-- if you remember about 15 years ago or longer, these color printers were
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.080]   inaccurate printers.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.760]   The government actually made a point I'd make these guys not-- you couldn't get that.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.560]   One green you need for the dollar bill.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   Right.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.200]   These kids, they were like 14.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.480]   And they were printing them up in the basement and they got caught-- they were washing them
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.800]   in the washing machine to make them feel right.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.280]   And this was a pretty good operation, but it was-- I think it was.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   It was a color laser printer that they were using.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.440]   You can scan the stuff in because most of the scanning software won't let you scan in
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   the US dollar.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.400]   I remember that one crack here.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.320]   I can get a match there.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   That's very easy.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   What happened?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   So the trick is to buy the printer for cash, do one run, and then throw it out.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.880]   Just like, that's what we do with guns when we're-- oh, never mind.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.880]   It's such an informative show.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.040]   It's like, oh, you can just get a crack to take care of that.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   No problem.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.360]   Well, let me ask you.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.200]   How do we know that you can't scan money?
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   If you do it, what happens?
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   The scanner says--
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   The screen savers, remember?
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   It came as that air.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   It won't let you do it.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   Well, the Photoshop gave us an air or something like that.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.840]   How are I trying to try a 20 or a 10?
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.360]   I got some Canadian money here.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   This is very colorful.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   I bet you-- I wonder if I could scan that.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   You think I could scan that?
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.200]   Yeah, but you have to scan it twice so it's worth the same amount.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.400]   Hey, not so anymore.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.360]   I couldn't quite work that joke.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   Not so anymore.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.720]   The dollar has been shrinking, which is good because I get paid in Canadian money.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.040]   That's why I have a stack of bills here.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:04.640]   As I'm leaving, they give me a stack of a wad of 20s and I go.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.280]   You bring it on the plane with you?
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.520]   Everybody care that iTunes hit a billion songs sold.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.800]   And they gave away 10,000 iTunes free money to some kid.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   They'd be like, just some kid.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   No, there was 10,000 gift certificate iTunes 5/5 generation of fake pods in a scholarship
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.840]   but the guy's name is Julie Hart.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   Isn't that cool?
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   It's the name of the event.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.840]   The scholarship and his name.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   I thought he got 10 iTunes.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.840]   I thought he got 10 iTunes.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:35.720]   Yeah, he got 10 iPods, $10,000 in songs and a 20-inch iMac and a scholarship in his name
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   in Juar.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   That's pretty good.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   All for buying.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   What song did he buy?
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   Something by Coldplay.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   Something called "Play."
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.000]   Something off X and Y.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   That's pretty funny.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.920]   The grocery store used to do this and not get as much publicity.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.840]   The one billion, though, that's a pretty big number.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   That's got a lot of zeros after it.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.480]   Kevin, we are talking about our speculation about the Apple announcement on Tuesday.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   Do you have any speculation?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   I don't have any insiders.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.880]   They're doing it on the Apple campus, so I know nothing this time.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.160]   Yeah, because you picked it the last time it was at the keynote.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.520]   You hit it, nailed it when they announced the Nano.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.080]   So nothing, huh?
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   Nothing.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.280]   What do you guys think it is?
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   Well, I think we're thinking maybe the-
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.400]   I think it's a waste of time, personally.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.240]   The 4X disgruntled.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.400]   We think it's a big video touchscreen iPod.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   Although, I don't know.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.320]   I think there's even money on the Mac Mini on the mini media center.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.120]   I don't think it was a video of airport express is what I'm hoping for.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.240]   Yeah, I think people forget that that was something everybody's wanted as an airport
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.600]   express, not only plays music, but also allows you to distribute that video.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.440]   Kevin, I think you might be right.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   I don't think so.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.120]   I bet against that.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   Why is that?
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   Movie industry?
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.880]   I think it's too ahead of the- that and I think it's ahead of its time.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.880]   I mean, Apple's usually a little bit ahead of its time, but that's pretty far out there.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:56.000]   You know, talking about iTunes, I heard a story, I think, on NPR about some of the record
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.920]   labels now holding back certain singles in order to convince people to buy physical CDs.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.800]   Oh, that's rude.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.840]   They're freaking out about the fact that people are just buying singles from the online stores
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   and they don't like it.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.960]   So they're saying, "Hey, we're going to keep some of our best stuff out of there."
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.680]   You know, the thing is, is that the reason that this music business is so screwed up
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.720]   is because they killed the singles business.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.840]   When I was a kid, we used to be able to buy singles.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   They used to make 45s until the album business-
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.360]   Then they realized that they could sell you an $18 CD with only one good song on it.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.880]   Yeah, the thing is that-
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.920]   From 45 to set singles and then the-
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   Right.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.920]   There were CD singles for a while.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.800]   Yeah, until the Beatles and the Rolling Stones came along, no band could sustain a whole album.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.720]   And no one since has been able to.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   It's very difficult.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   It's very few and far between.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.160]   And I think Frank Sinatra would argue with you about-
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   Oh, all right.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   Sinatra.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   Oh, yeah, well, that's fine.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160]   Duke of Sinatra.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.120]   Bring in the Sinatra card.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   Every time.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.400]   It always descends to that, doesn't it, John?
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.920]   Sinatra probably had a Mac too, right?
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.160]   It's probably as many Mac as we speak.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.640]   Any other stories top of mind?
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   This is kind of-
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   Either it was a demo-
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.160]   Actually, we're going to have a fun demo coming up on DLTTV on Tuesday.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.720]   We're going to show off the Democracy player.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720]   Have you guys seen this yet?
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   Yeah, we're on it.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.240]   That's our broadcast machine.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.400]   Our BitTorrent broadcast machine support is from the Participatory Culture Foundation.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.800]   Yeah, the player is really cool.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   Yeah, and we're supposed to be on the guide.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.880]   I don't know if that's actually happened or not.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.840]   Well, there was a big channel guide.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.960]   There's a few channels that are actually hosted right there, like Rocket Booms on there.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   They said they would-
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   I'm mad at them because they said if you use our broadcast machine, if you keep using
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.480]   our broadcast machine, you'll be featured on the Democracy player.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   So it's been out for a Mac for a while, but it's not out for Windows.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.080]   It came out for Windows.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   It's pretty cool.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.680]   I think that there's a couple of good ones we've mentioned Fire Ant before, which is also
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   very good.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:10.000]   The problem is do people want yet another player on their computer?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.920]   Well, it's less the player than the fact that it's the player that's built around being
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.160]   able to play back torrents.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   Wow, video.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.160]   Right.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.400]   Did you know that the beaver lived amid dinosaurs?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.840]   Somebody's up on Google News.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.680]   We are really down at the bottom of the bar.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:38.240]   Why don't we bring up that there's a March- is there a probe approaching Mars?
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.720]   Oh, well, I hope Mars is ready.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:46.280]   Yeah, when we just start playing some Mike Myers clips.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.640]   I tell you, we're in bad shape now.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.720]   We're going to kill the show.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.400]   Oh, no, don't kill it yet, please.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.240]   Hey, John, is it true you're doing a new show on Ziff Davis?
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.440]   Yeah, I haven't found it but the two.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   What's that?
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   What's now?
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   What's he working on?
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   We're working on something.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440]   What?
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.880]   It's another, you know, Jim Lauterback's basically recreating ZD TV over there.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   No, he can't do that.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   We're doing that.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.880]   That's not allowed.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.320]   We got something else going on here.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.960]   What have we got going on?
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.760]   Well, tonight, nothing.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.840]   Absolutely, nothing, clearly.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.280]   But generally speaking, we get something.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.000]   I don't know if, yeah.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.040]   So, well, Patrick, you would know what's going on.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.400]   Oh, I'm not ready to talk about it.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.120]   Not at all.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   Interesting.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.720]   So, should I just fold up the 10 here and put to twit.tv to bed?
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   No, actually part of the deal was I can't do this thing unless I can cross-promote.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.320]   Is the new network called Yiff Davis?
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.200]   Yiff.tv.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   Yiff.tv.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   What a whore.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   Oh, my God.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   Okay, you got it.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.680]   But English subtitles are still in German.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Yig.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Yiff.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   Yiff.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.680]   Yiff.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.520]   Do you have to use in Yig from now on?
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   I'm going to give you a Kevin.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.040]   But you got to learn German first, John.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.040]   Sorry.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.480]   I wonder if I can get the license for Yig here in the USA.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.040]   Yig.com is probably available.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.040]   You act quickly.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.040]   There's too many domain names to try and buy.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   Too many.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   Can't own them all.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.040]   Expensive after a while.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.800]   So, okay, so you guys, you're going to go out and you're going to start a tech TV with
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   Ziff Davis.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.200]   You're going to let them do it again, huh?
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600]   Well, you know what?
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.440]   Let me actually, let me, I had time to speak for a moment here because--
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   Speak freely.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:36.040]   --Ziff Davis, the Ziff Davis that you ranked on in the podcast, which was a fun interview
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.040]   to listen to actually.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   I've never seen--
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.400]   Did they take the obscenities out?
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   I can't remember.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   They took--
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   Some of them.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   --the fluffer references were still in there.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   I don't know about you.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   I'm thinking I'm the absurdity.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   And that was part of it.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   Yeah, I was hoping they didn't.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   Boy, I just got the best look from my life.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   Just looking at her head, shaking her head, and looking at me.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:03.600]   This is the Leoville Town Square podcast, which is not an official production of Leoville
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.120]   Town Square, but they asked me to be on it, so I agreed.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.480]   So, let me just give-- I'll give you the background.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.200]   They asked, "Why are you never on D.L.TV?"
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.760]   I said, "Well, I'm reluctant to be on D.L.TV, because I don't want to-- if Patrick and
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.840]   I appear on a show that looks like the screensavers together, people are going to say, "The
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   screensavers back together."
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.440]   And I don't think Ziff Davis has standing to be the one who does it.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.240]   I don't want them to do it again.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.480]   And so you want to say that they're not the same ZD.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.120]   Well, yeah, it's a vastly different crew, because the Ziff Davis that sold--
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   That sold us down the river to Vulcan ventures is like-- not a whole lot of people from those
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   days now.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   Sure.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   And it's totally new management.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.440]   It's not so much that it's ZD.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.800]   It's mostly-- I just don't want any corporation at all.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:50.440]   I think we've learned our lesson having corporate stujes run these things.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.000]   I mean, I think we should do it ourselves.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.840]   But if you guys choose to go that way, be my guess.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:54:00.280]   I'd like to say that I'd like to also point out that I'm working for a couple of-- and
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.640]   I quote, "corporate stujes" who are basically like, "Do what you gotta do, make the content."
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   Oh, I agree.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.600]   And I was very clear, and I said that, that you and Jim Latterback are great, and I have
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.600]   no trouble at all.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.760]   I would love to do that.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.840]   But I just think that-- I don't know.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.520]   I think that if we're going to bring back tech TV, we should bring back tech TV, not
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   somebody else.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   Well, apart from Eric Hippo.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.520]   Not Eric Hippo.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   I'm actually in disagreement with that.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.720]   Why do you say that, John?
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.080]   Because I don't think-- I think tech TV died and it's over.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   I think--
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   Well, I agree with that also.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.240]   I don't think you're really-- I think you want to just create something new from scratch.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   Yes.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.240]   Which is what you're doing.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.880]   And so the other stuff is just like ancillary.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   Well, I mean, it's what everybody's doing.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.040]   It's Kevin when you're looking at what's going on in dignity.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.160]   I think that it doesn't matter where we are, as long as we're producing good quality content
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.960]   that's free to people to download, it's like, why not?
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.520]   If we can make money, let's do it.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   Yeah, but--
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.520]   Well, I disagree, Kevin.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.520]   It does matter where we are.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   I mean, you're right.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   But can you be free--
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   Kevin's only going to make money.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:04.480]   Can you be free if you're doing it for a major corporation or a network?
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   I would say no.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.840]   Well, it depends on what kind of constraints that you're running into.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.240]   I mean, I know with Patrick, I mean, you pretty much are in charge of that show.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   But until he's not.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   Until he's not.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.240]   Until he's not.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   Well, then they don't want to change it.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   They want to change it.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   They could.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.120]   Hey, Leo, I was never under contract at Tech TV or ZD TV.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.720]   So if they did so-- if they wanted to tell me to do something they didn't want to do,
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   I could quit.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   And that's my option.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   Right.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.840]   But I think if we build ourselves, we don't have to worry about that option.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.120]   Well, what I wanted-- what I wanted to-- somebody I want to say though, it's like, I get a lot
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.000]   of email like, oh, are you going to try to bring this?
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.200]   And I know you get this, Leo.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.760]   And I know you get a Kevin where it's like, oh, are you guys going to try to get this
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   on television?
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.400]   And it's like the last thing I ever want to do is want to be involved with.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.240]   If somebody-- if somebody's out there and they want to take-- which I can't imagine
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:53.080]   want to take, you know, www.dl.tv and put it on insert name of network here, you know,
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.360]   and sign us a check and say, send us the tapes.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.360]   Great.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   I'm not going to say no to that.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.360]   No, but we wouldn't be happy to be honest with you.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   Yeah, well--
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   We wouldn't be happy.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.560]   Well, I can't imagine any network that wouldn't want to be like the classic like what you
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   need is.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   Right.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.560]   And I'm going to check, Leo.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.560]   Well, no, no.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.720]   And by the way, I'm the only one who's still doing this kind of stuff on mainstream media,
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.280]   both for Clear Channel and for Rogers in Canada.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   Ironically enough.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.600]   Ironically enough.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.800]   But my dream and my goal and my prayer is that we could-- we can own this stuff ourselves
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.960]   and not have to do it-- and not have to work for the new--
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.960]   That's right, Leo.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.400]   --are working for Clear Channel, aren't you?
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   I am.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.800]   That's like the cruel irony of this, is that you're working for--
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.720]   Well, but I can-- but that's the only reason I can afford to do all this stuff for free.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.720]   And same for you.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   I understand.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   That's not the issue.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.120]   But what I'm hoping we're building to is creating our own jobs.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   But maybe not.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.320]   Maybe it does require a Ziff Davis or a Yahoo or an AOL--
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   No, it doesn't.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.680]   Well, then what are you doing?
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   Quit your whining.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.000]   What are you doing going to the man, man?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   What do you think, K?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   You're the only outsider here.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.160]   If anybody knows me, they know I do as much work as I possibly can across the market
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   as much as possible.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.160]   You don't care.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.320]   And nobody ever has owned Devorak.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.560]   And that's really the truth of it.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   But we're not in that situation.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.560]   You know, there's always a man--
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.560]   There's always a man.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.880]   --is there-- that's what I'm starting to realize that there is always a man, isn't there?
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   I like that.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.680]   You know, we've got a teeny little network.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.040]   And some people think I'm the man and look at me that way.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   Right, there's always a man.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   I love the ad.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.840]   Have you seen the ad where the phone company, exec, or somebody, executive is--
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   Sticking it to myself.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.440]   Sticking it to the man and his little underlink says, but sir, aren't you the man?
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.560]   Well, yes, I am.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.840]   Hey, what about Ricky Gervais getting $2 a show?
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   Is he going to get $2 a show?
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   That's the question.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   Yeah, that was announced a couple days ago.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   Yeah, but is he going to get--
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.440]   He's not in the podcast section.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.280]   Is he going to get it?
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.560]   He may get it, but what they're going to do is they're moving that over.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.200]   It's going to end up being in the audio books.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   Now, we could-- by the way, we've always been in the position of doing this.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.880]   Audible came to us very early on and said, you could sell to it on Audible.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.200]   We could have-- nobody would have put out a press release had we done it.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.560]   Ricky got-- look it.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.040]   There were a lot of downloads when it was free of Ricky's podcast.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:06.080]   And Glenn, over there, said he was getting $400,000 downloads a week.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:11.600]   But the question is, OK, now start charging $6.95 for four baby episodes.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.080]   They don't even think how many episodes they're going to do.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.560]   I think it was four months.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   Maybe.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   At $6.95.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.560]   Maybe.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   They're not even guaranteeing that.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   How many people are going to subscribe?
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   How many do they lose?
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.560]   $10,000.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.560]   Well, $10,000?
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   $10,000?
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   $10,000?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   $10,000?
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.560]   That's $7.00 a pop, $70,000 a month.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   No, they'll do more than that.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.880]   I think they were smart because they put the first season out for free and they hooked
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   a lot of people.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.880]   First case is always for you.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.160]   I think they're going to be shocked that I think that they're expecting more people
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.160]   to sign up.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.480]   I think the minute this stuff is paid, I don't know.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   I think you lose a lot of the audience.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.280]   You don't seem to find out if it gets cracked too.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.240]   The classic number is 10 to 1.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.720]   What happened when Wall Street Journal went WSK.com?
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.820]   That's different, though.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.000]   You pay for Wall Street Journal because you make money from getting Wall Street Journal.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.640]   I think that's you can justify that.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   I think that's true.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.400]   I think that Wall Street Journal doesn't count in any of these comparisons.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.480]   Yeah, but if anyone ever told me people would pay what they do for ringtones, I wouldn't
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   believe that's true.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.080]   Yeah, the ringtone thing is a different story.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   That's a fair point.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   I think it's right now.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.280]   It's a $6 billion worldwide industry.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   So we have had a standing invitation to put it on Audible to sell it for whatever we wanted.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.600]   The two reasons I've said no is I don't want to put copy protection in it.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.160]   I think that our audience doesn't want a paid version of it.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.840]   That's why we've kind of headed more towards the advertising.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.520]   I'd like to do a paid version, but I just don't think people will pay for it.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.760]   But on Audible, you can't even pay for anything on Audible without having a paid membership
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.200]   already.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.440]   That's what I think is the stupid thing.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.440]   You can.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   No, you can.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.160]   Through iTunes, you can buy anything on Audible through iTunes, can't you?
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   Okay, because I had an Audible version for the longest time.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.160]   That's different.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   No, I have an Audible membership.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   I cancelled it.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.920]   I use it because I get two books a month.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.720]   But they're trying to get me to cancel it because I have the old program, which they
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:00.960]   sent me a note, they sent me a free, like harmonica, some sort of cheap thing and a
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.080]   note begging me to change my subscription saying, you know, we lose money on this.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.520]   You would really be doing us a favor if you changed a more expensive subscription.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520]   I kid you not.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.080]   I should have saved this note.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.240]   And of course, I've ignored it.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.640]   I'll edit this all out.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.240]   Of course, I always say that and I never do because I get a lot of...
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.920]   No, you know, I know you don't.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   I never cut out the answer.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.600]   I really like to shoot the breeze there at the end.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.400]   You get that, really?
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Nobody said that to me yet, really?
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.960]   Like you're talking too much at the end?
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.480]   I figure people have tuned out by now.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.400]   Most people, yeah, I have hung up by now.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.600]   They're on this show today.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.120]   I think they hung up really early.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.920]   That's why I try to put the, you know, some really juicy gossipy stuff at the end.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920]   So keep them tuned.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   Cats pregnant.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.840]   Yeah, it's official now.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.800]   There's a big story.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.000]   She put it on a blog.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Oh, she did.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Along with a list of products she'd be showing up.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Sorry.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Sorry.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   What's your broadening?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   Catchwords.com/blog or no.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.160]   Yeah, just go to .com and then you have to...
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.760]   It's kind of a strange interface.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.680]   Baby gadgets and high-tech parents?
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   Let's stop.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.720]   First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in a high-tech baby carriage.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.320]   Is Megan still doing her jumping monkeys with...
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   I think she kind of stopped doing that.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   She's kind of busy.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   Wow.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.080]   She's got a lot of products on here.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.800]   Are these for sale?
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   What's the deal?
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   Did she get them for free?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.520]   Because she put a link on there or what?
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.600]   The world's first hands-free breast pump.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.360]   Hey, can we jump on some else?
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.720]   Are they looking for volunteers?
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.720]   We've really just revolted John.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.680]   I think this is a first...
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.800]   I don't even see that on here.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   I'm looking at her home page.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.520]   You've got to click the blog link, the blog thing, and then it's kind of a weird user interface.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]   No, I see.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.040]   Okay, so I really have no idea about breast pumps because I've never used one, but this
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   looks really darn cool.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   No, Patrick, stop.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   Don't read the copy.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   Let's hope the pictures don't leak out again.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040]   How about this?
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   How about this?
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:13.360]   We all wish Cat and Keith a painless as possible safe birthing process.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.400]   Of course we wish that.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.760]   Patrick, when is Patrick Norton Jr. coming along?
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.640]   Oh boy, that's coming soon.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.640]   Oh yeah?
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.040]   Anything you want to share with us?
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.360]   I think it's a good to have a career for a little while.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   Okay.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.280]   Now she's not selling any of this stuff.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   I'm looking at the URLs.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.040]   There's no way that there's no way to...
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.800]   Dude, they're not tracking it.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   Which is a mistake.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:41.040]   How do you get the John Devorak model breast pump?
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   Dead silencing.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   I'm just visualizing.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   No, I'm just visualizing.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.560]   It's just like a thousand jokes just passed through the night.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.720]   I'm thinking, "God, I can't say any of them."
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.800]   Because we know Leo won't edit it out.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.840]   Has anybody heard any more about the origami, the portable device from Microsoft?
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.440]   There's like a weird sight that Microsoft seems to have owned.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   That's crazy.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.600]   You see the little device that Engadget showing?
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   No.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.280]   They're saying it's a handheld.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.200]   They're showing off pictures of mock-up or not mock-up, but actually hidden photos or
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   something that somebody took from a mobile.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.520]   Oh, for mobile lifestyle PC says Engadget.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.160]   And when is Microsoft going to announce this?
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160]   Soon, I guess, a whole week from now or something.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.960]   Is this going to be like that idiotic watch they did?
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.280]   A little bigger than that.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   Oh, the spot watch.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280]   That's still around.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   Yeah, it is.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.040]   I've met people who actually use those.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.440]   Oh, I work with people who use them.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   It just baffles me.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.920]   The thing is as big as a loaf of bread on your arm.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.920]   It's ridiculous.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:39.120]   Also, for the kids today, that's a big style, the giant ten-inch ear a watch from.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.680]   Yeah, so, yeah, it's a new PC category.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   Ten inches.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   Uh-oh.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   Uh-oh.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.320]   It's just you and me now, Doug.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   Just the boys, huh?
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.840]   I think we just had a major...
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.360]   You got a Skype meltdown?
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360]   Skype meltdown, I guess.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360]   I don't know what happened.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   Well, yeah.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.800]   Leo forgot to put quarters in the meter.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   We're back.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.160]   Okay, well, I think that wraps it up.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.280]   I think really Skype was trying to tell us something.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.440]   It's a message from the guys.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.240]   We probably should wrap this up.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.200]   I think it's the old yellow edition between behind the wood shed.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   Oh, no.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.840]   Okay, you've named it now.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   It's official.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   The old yellow episode.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.440]   You've been telling me to tell some of those punch cards stories.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.760]   It's a long guys.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.160]   All right, have fun in Florida and in Germany.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160]   If anybody is...
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.240]   Deutsche Line, if anybody wants to escort John to see the sites of Berlin, including...
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   John@devorect.org.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   The KitKat Club.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.040]   That's what I'm open for.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.640]   That's what he's looking for.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.560]   All right, John, thanks a lot for joining us.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.720]   Devorect.org/blog.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.360]   Doug K at IT Conversations.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.760]   I hope we haven't dragged your reputation through the mud with this, particularly by
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.440]   podcast, but remember he had nothing to do with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.640]   Hey, he's the man.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.920]   He is the original, the progenitor of podcasting, which doesn't roll off the tongue like the
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.320]   pod father, but it's what it is.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   Thank you, Doug.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   Have a great one.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320]   We'll talk soon.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   Take care.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.760]   Kevin Rose, I'm glad you could be here.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.440]   It was nice to talk to you.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.440]   Definitely.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   How things going with Dig?
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   Well, good.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.600]   We've got some new features coming out soon.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   Good.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   We'll look forward to that.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   Very soon.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Yeah, digg.com.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.720]   David Prager, are you working on any new show?
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.480]   What shows for a system?
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.560]   And then we've been doing Dig Nation Live.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.680]   We've got this in Digital Show.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.360]   Alex Albrecht is working really hard on Control Alt Chicken.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.240]   I don't know if you've heard of that.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Could you show?
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   Chicken.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   So that's serious.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   It's not a joke.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   No, not a joke.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   It's serious.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   All right.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   We'll see how it is.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   I've got my fingers crossed.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.760]   But we've also got a short comedy show that's going to be coming out.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.280]   It's about maybe a minute or two minutes per show that it'll be starting up in the next
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   month.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   Excellent.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280]   And then what else?
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280]   We've got one more.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   I just came thinking of it.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   Keep it in business.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.720]   Control Alt Chicken is a cooking show.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.920]   It's a geek cooking show.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   Wow.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   Alex is doing it.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   That's very cool.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   What kind of stuff is he going to cook?
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   No.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   We have no idea.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.920]   It should be interesting.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   Are you going to join him?
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.280]   Are you going to join him on that?
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   No, no.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   He's doing that in a way.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   So it's his thing, huh?
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.520]   And what do you mean Dig Nation has been live?
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520]   Have you been in live audiences?
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.480]   Well, I just came out the other night.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.200]   We just did a live show for the first time.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.840]   Well, I didn't manage to get there until the tail end of it.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.480]   Where were you?
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   In coding.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480]   No, I mean, where was--
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   We got to deal.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   We'll get to that.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.000]   What was the beach-- the beach chalet?
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Oh, fun.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   That was cool.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   That sounds great.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   Very cool, yeah.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   All right.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.160]   Well, you guys have a great time.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.920]   Thank you for joining us on this Twitter.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   And I promise I'll edit it down.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.800]   And it'll be a snappy 30-minute show.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.400]   It'll sound so good.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400]   They'll get--
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   18 minutes.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400]   Maybe-- OK.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   13 minutes.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.400]   Maybe a five-minute show.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.040]   But it'll be good.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.280]   It doesn't be with long commutes.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.440]   Just play it over and over.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.560]   And D-L-T-V, of course, D-L-DOT-TV is the future of tech
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.720]   programming on the net.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.920]   Yeah, the video-- I'm basically the AV department
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.280]   for all of this video in the audience.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.800]   Back in the AV squad.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.560]   Back in the AV squad.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.160]   This shows you.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.360]   And everything's never changed.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.360]   Thanks, guys.
