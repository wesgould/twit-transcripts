[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.640]   And you know, actually we were talking before the show about the latest news and we were
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.040]   so depressed that we decided to watch cat videos.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   And now I feel much, much better.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.280]   Thank you, O doctor.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.240]   He's the doctor of my brain.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   He told me what to do.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   Cats for the win.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   Cats for the win.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.280]   By the way, the world is burning over your left shoulder just in case you may be.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   Oh, let me turn that off.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.640]   Maybe you didn't know that.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   Were you playing?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.200]   Were you playing a little Call of Duty before the show?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.160]   I was playing Call of Duty.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Is this a new studio?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.360]   Is this the new IQMZ studio?
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   And this is the new pit for me and my daughter play games together.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   Oh, the game is.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.120]   Which is what I was doing all day.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.760]   We were out there twitching plan Battlefront all day.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   Battlefront and I call a duty.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.320]   I'm not the best Call of Duty player first of all.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.520]   And second of all, I get really angry with that game.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.640]   So I try not to play that with children.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520]   Battlefront was like we played it together.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.320]   We actually beat two missions and she was so happy and she's addicted to Star Wars.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   So it's a win win for me.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.600]   Oh, Battlefront and I battle field.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.520]   You're playing the Star Wars MMORPG.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   That's about the field.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   You said Battlefront.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.920]   My brain said Battlefield.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   Battlefront.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   Is that good game?
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   Man, it's great.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.600]   A lot of people have a lot of complaints about it, but people complain about everything.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   It's fun for what I want to do and it's fun for what she wants to do.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.280]   You get to be Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, you shoot things, you light everything and
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   you get to fly.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   Who did you?
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.440]   I mean, who did you choose to be?
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   Everybody.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   Everybody.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.640]   The only person I don't like being is Seth Lord.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.240]   I don't like being old guy.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   He doesn't do that much stuff.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   Could I be Jar Jar?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   There is no Jar Jar.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   They would not do that to anybody.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   The other reason I love it.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.800]   You can break the disc if that happened, but Darth Vader and Luke obviously are the two
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.280]   pentacles are playing.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.080]   You're working your way up.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.840]   I wouldn't mind being Bubba Fett.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   That'd be kind of fun.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   He had a nice outfit.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.640]   Also, you're also here.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.800]   Harry McCracken, the technologyizer from FAST company.com.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   I can still call you the technology.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   You can do that forever.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   And oh, are you using an iPad Pro?
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080]   This is the iPad Pro.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   The new Apple--
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.800]   It's curious to see how well it works as a twit tablet, given that it's a little bit
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.080]   larger and it didn't want to block fill.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.640]   It's kind of more like a laptop than that.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   It's much more laptop than that.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.800]   Your previous iteration.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.840]   You went for the Apple keyboard, not the Logitech Create keyboard.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   The Logitech one is good too.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.120]   I mean, if you want an actual laptop type keyboard, the Logitech is quite good, but
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.280]   it's also larger and heavier as a case.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.480]   Did you get the pencil yet?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   I had the pencil.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.000]   The pencil is really cool.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.120]   I was in the Apple store on day after Thanksgiving.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040]   I realized after we already left for the mall that this is Black Friday.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.160]   I thought, oh my god, what have I done?
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   But it was late in the day and they had three Apple pencils, so I canceled my online order
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   and I got--
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   They had them for sale?
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   Three of them.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   Also here, Philip Elmer, do away from fortune.com at PhilipEd or PED at Mac.com.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280]   You want to give out your email address, really?
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   Sure.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   Why not?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Nice to have you.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   You want me.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   Oh, dear.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.800]   Oh, dear, oh dear.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.040]   Good article in the Sunday Times, actually, about swatting.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.520]   What is swatting, Philip?
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.040]   That's when you find someone you don't like very much and you give the police their address
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   and you say the person there is just murdered four people and they're about to kill somebody
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040]   else.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.480]   You better hurry up and get there.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.720]   So the SWAT teams and their SWAT teams in 80% of the towns in America with over 30,000
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   people, so they're plenty--
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.120]   Special weapons and tactical unit.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   Right.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.720]   So they show up in their bulletproof cars with their black masks and their grenade launchers
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and their submachine guns and they burst into your house and your poor parents are stunned
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.920]   to find that they're being shackled and dragged out of the house.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.080]   It happens a lot, apparently.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.320]   And the sad thing is it's of course a terrible waste of resources costs thousands of dollars,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.120]   takes police off duty for a non-crime when they should be and could be fighting real
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   crime.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.680]   And there's always the risk when you've got high-powered rifles aimed at you that somebody's
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.480]   going to get hurt.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   Right.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   And people--
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.640]   I think one person has been shot.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:33.720]   But it's not healthy to have angry police with weapons pointing them at you.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.160]   And the other thing with this article, the story it tells about one individual who did
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.520]   a lot of these things--
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   His name wasn't--
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.160]   --handle was obnoxious.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.080]   So he clearly didn't mind being obnoxious.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.440]   And because he was underage, the newspaper never mentioned his name.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.000]   And he's currently incarcerated.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.720]   But it took a lot to track him down.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.360]   And he had to really ask for it before he turned out to be a Canadian.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.160]   And the Americans had a hard time getting the counties to step up to the play.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.640]   It turns out that a lot of this is happening on twitch.tv.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.760]   In fact, most of obnoxious is a SWAT's run.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.440]   We're just twitch streamers, people who are playing games.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.360]   And he particularly focused on women using Twitch to play games.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.000]   Some of these women-- it was their full-time job.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.520]   This was a big deal for them.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.920]   And he would harass them endlessly and eventually swat them sometimes many times.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.320]   And at the same time, say, I'm unextraditable.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   I'm untouchable.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.200]   I can't be arrested knowing that, A, there isn't really any law yet against this.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.560]   You would think it would be a felony.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   It's a misdemeanor.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.280]   How could it not be a felony?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.000]   A good question.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.880]   I want to say something like, oh, well, why don't they have caller ID to know where the
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   call is coming from?
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.680]   But then at the same time, you read about the stories of the girl placing an order online
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.280]   with her and left a note in the pizza spot saying she's being kidnapped and stuff like
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   that.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   And somebody from online was playing a game to hear somebody being beaten in the background.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.520]   It actually worked to the advantage of coming help the person.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.800]   So I guess they still got to go check it out.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   But if you're getting phone calls from Canada--
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   Well, no.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   --that's just outrageous and special.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.720]   So our swatter and this guy too, I'm sure, they use-- there are a lot of services online
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.120]   that allow you to spoof any number you want.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.720]   So they could even use a local number.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   That doesn't matter.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.280]   They don't know the guys from Canada.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.440]   They did track him down using-- you know, subpoenaing the company that does the spoof
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.240]   numbers and working their way through the ranks is not an easy thing to do.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   It's very difficult.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.040]   It takes a lot of subpoenas.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.280]   But once they found out he was in Canada, then it was very little they could do except
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.840]   to try to get the cooperation of Canadian authorities.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:00.280]   And in fact, they didn't get the cooperation until get this obnoxious started streaming
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.120]   his SWAT calls on Twitch.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.200]   And then they called up and said, hey, watch Twitch, he's doing it.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   He was a tad over confident.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Thank God.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.840]   Does everybody-- does everybody-- do all our listeners know about Twitch?
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.760]   Maybe the doctor who does it can explain what that is.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   Twitch.tv.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.960]   You ever do a little Twitch in?
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.320]   Yeah, it was Twitch in today with my daughter.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.480]   Do you stream on Twitch or just-- I could not talk a little bad about it.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.680]   Yeah, I guess I shouldn't.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   You shouldn't feel bad.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   In fact, one of our-- my old producer, one of our great friends, OMG Chad, streams, quite
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.120]   successfully on Twitch.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.520]   Twitch allows you to take a picture of yourself while you're playing a game.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.080]   It's these Let's Play videos.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.560]   Generally live, the chat room very active.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.240]   Apparently, the chat room can donate.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.800]   Chat makes some good money from people donating as they watch.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:54.200]   They'll give a buck-- a buck, $5, $10, lots of money sometimes, kind of to support you,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.880]   kind of like a Patreon style crowd source.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   So there are quite a few people who make a living, you know, twitching.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   It's all about community.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   It's kind of what we do.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.160]   If you build a community around what you're doing, people love you.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.920]   Chad said the best thing to do if you're on Twitch is not really about the game.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.680]   It's about you and relationship with the chat room.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.080]   You got to interact with the chat room, talk to them.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.920]   You got to cultivate a community there.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.360]   Is part of the appeal that they're giving away cheats?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.280]   They're showing people how to solve the problems on these first person shooter games?
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.120]   I think for some people it's instructional, but more it's fun I think, right?
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.600]   It could be for anything.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.920]   I watched a couple times where I did want to learn how to get past a level and you can
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.400]   watch somebody beat the game that you're trying to beat.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   Or you're just sitting there like you're bored and you're hanging out and you got it
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   all in the background.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.040]   Like today a guy was watching me and my daughter play Battlefront.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.080]   We're not good or anything, but he was watching it and when he got done, he was like, "Oh,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.520]   I think I'm going to go buy that game because it looks like you guys are having fun."
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.040]   And he gets to see somebody play it.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.960]   You know, as opposed to watch somebody do a review where they tell you something's perfect
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.400]   and it's paid for advertisement basically, you can actually watch people play it and
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.800]   you can see if they're enjoying it or not.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   I think if people are looking for kids, he's hyped on it.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   That means it's all right.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Right.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.280]   When you're looking to beat a level or you're looking for cheat codes, you go to YouTube and
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.080]   you can watch YouTube Let's Play videos that are to the point.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.320]   You will say, "Here's what you do.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.080]   You do this, this, this, and this."
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.760]   Twitch is really much more social.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:25.240]   Although some of it is this idea of gaming as a spectator sport, you know, like football.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.200]   I think some of it is also that League of Legends is huge on Twitch and people are really,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.720]   you sometimes have thousands of people watching a game between well-known players on Twitch
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.800]   and that's a big part of it as well.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.280]   It's just amazing to me that a whole economy has grown up around Twitch, that you can
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   actually make a living.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.480]   Well, we live in very interesting times.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.120]   You can make a living.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.120]   So what is this?
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.520]   This is a guy getting swatted.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.080]   It's a well-known twitcher and this is the danger of it.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.560]   I mean, you know, a gun's drawn.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.080]   The police are acting responsibly because what they've heard is a call saying I'm being
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.960]   held hostage or I'm going to shoot people, the guy who swatted us said I've placed bombs
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.600]   all around Twitch.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   I'm going in there.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   I have a bunch of weapons.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.480]   I'm going to shoot everybody execution style and then blowing the place up.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   And so, now the good news is our local police department knew about swadding and they reacted
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.120]   very sensibly to it.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.200]   I would hope that every police department would know about it, but I wonder if that's
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   true.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.680]   I think they're learning.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   Here's an example.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.120]   This is obnoxious at work in Ontario, California, which is in the LA area.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   Police got a call.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.800]   A local man was doing dope, had shot and killed his father with an AR-15, was thinking about
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.520]   killing his mother.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.440]   They sent this is the Ontario police force 32 units to the address.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.080]   That's 90% of the available law enforcement resources, including three supervisors, throngs
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.520]   of squad cars, an armored bear cat, that's an armored vehicle, a helicopter, a canine
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.720]   unit, only to find three people, a mother, her boyfriend and her son inside, and perfectly
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   safe.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.680]   The son was a League of Legends gamer who had angered obnoxious merely by defending one
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.280]   of his female victims online.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:25.240]   The ordeal cost Ontario $6,500, but the detective assigned to the case said, "Hey, I've got felony
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   cases sitting in my lap.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.440]   Why would I take this cyber case?"
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.340]   Tracking down all these records, trying to find a guy who's in another country.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.340]   That's the problem.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.200]   Even if they catch him most of the time, it's a misdemeanor.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.800]   There are moves to make these more seriously illegal.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.040]   This is the, I have to say, we're really exposed to the dark side of the internet.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.520]   The New York Times published in the magazine today, so I think a lot of other people are
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.680]   going to know about it.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.560]   What happens if there's a real problem during the time that 90% of the research are being
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   wasted?
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.640]   In the New York Times, being the liberal rag that it is, I say that with jest, but of
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.480]   course focused on the over-militarized police as the problem.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.960]   I don't think that's exactly fair.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.960]   Again, the one time they don't show up and it's a real situation, now they've got a
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.720]   problem on their hands.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.440]   They have to do, and I think they are doing exactly what they need to do, and one hopes
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.960]   they're well-trained so they don't shoot unless there's cause to shoot.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:31.920]   You can't, I mean, to be in that position of being faced with heavily armed people.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   That's why I don't play on Xbox.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.000]   I know you love your Xbox, but what?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.440]   The rhetoric I hear from my Xbox versus my PlayStation, my PS4 is full of adults, and
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   yeah, you get some banter that's annoying sometimes.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   The Xbox is worse.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   That's like my Xbox.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   Oh, it's exponentially worse.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.080]   It's over the top worse than people on PlayStation.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080]   Dramatically.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.600]   Just go play Call of Duty for an hour on each system and you'll see it.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.800]   Just hop in and out of lobbies and it's insane the difference.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.560]   Now this kid was 16, the kid who's doing this.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.040]   He was abused by his father, beaten by his father.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.760]   His mother was mentally ill and hospitalized.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.680]   They did interview him and I guess psychologists interviewed him and said he's well on his
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.880]   way to being a psychopath.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.400]   That apparently has no moral compass.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.240]   It enjoys the pain of others but doesn't really have any empathy for others.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.480]   The problem is it doesn't take many of those people with technical skills to make this
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   cause a problem.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.000]   There's 10 of them.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.160]   He was swatted hundreds and hundreds of times and it was very difficult.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   If it weren't for a fairly obsessed detective named Finley pursuing this from I think was
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.680]   Alfreda, Georgia, BA Finley, John's Creek outside Atlanta, he probably never would have
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.760]   been caught.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.520]   So why is it that it's so easy to spoof caller ID?
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   If you had--
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   Trivial.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   --soup.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.680]   Yeah, but could we create spoof proof caller ID and do a lot to ameliorate this?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.720]   Yeah, well this comes down to really the fundamental issue on the internet in general
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.360]   of bad behavior which is anonymity.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.840]   There's a real nexus between me getting-- if you don't know who I am, I can do anything
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   I want.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:34.560]   It's a problem in forums, in my social media, in our chatroom.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.320]   We allow anonymity in our chatroom because I think anonymity is important.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.440]   I think people ought to be able to kind of have handles and express themselves.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.360]   We've talked from time to time about not having a verified chatroom, making sure that we know
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   who people are.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.680]   It would certainly eliminate a lot of problems.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.880]   But I just-- I think there's a good case to be made that people should be able to participate
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.920]   anonymously except that some people, very few, take advantage of that.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.960]   That's really what it comes down to, right?
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   Is it?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   Almost every spam phone call like that and I get a lot of them these days appears to
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.960]   be coming from my own area.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   Oh, yeah, every time.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.520]   I assume none of them are actually in San Francisco.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   Every time.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.440]   I'm going to pick it up because you think it might be a friend or a local business or
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.240]   whatever.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.600]   Somebody saying I think it's probably right because of the widespread use of VoIP and
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.000]   digital phone calling.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.760]   Probably almost impossible to prove that.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.320]   And I use Google Voice which is sort of a form of numbers spoofing.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.280]   Skype, when you call from Skype you don't get a normal number when you call somebody
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   from Skype.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   All right, that's enough.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.800]   We watched cat videos to forget this and now I'm depressed again.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   What are you depressed for?
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   It's your birthday.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.400]   You're a party and dancer you want to.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.800]   I don't hear about that.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   Nobody's swatted us.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   We're good.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   We're good.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.200]   I love this.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.680]   Apple Watch owners glance at their risks 60 to 80 times a day.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.920]   Philip, you had this story at fortune.com.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.040]   They're actually two different studies, your quote.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.520]   Yeah, the best one was the, not the Risley one.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:12.400]   Risley every week asks a question of a group of 2,500 watch owners which is not representative
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   but it gives you a sense of-
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.880]   It's a large sample size but it's self-supporting, right?
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.840]   Right, and it's, and you know people who hate the watch probably aren't going to answer
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.920]   questions about what they do with it.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.120]   But the second study, remind me who did it.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.600]   I don't have this in front of me.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.960]   It was a university study, University of Stockholm's mobile life center.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   Right.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   They strapped cameras onto a dozen people and followed them for a month and recorded, whenever
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.040]   they could, they recorded the interactions.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.280]   So they got actual, this is real data.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:53.440]   And you know, not surprisingly, they look at their watch most often, like 50% of the
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   things and then they look-
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   See what time it is.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   What a thought.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   Go figure.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.400]   Actually, it drops off dramatically after watch face and notifications.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:13.000]   You know, suddenly we're down to 6% workout time or 6% notifications and you get on to
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.640]   checking mail 0.1%.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:23.000]   I think the notification is interesting because any watch will give you the 50% case which
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   is what time is it.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.400]   In fact, most watches do it better than the Apple watch does because it doesn't show
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.720]   the time unless you do it just right.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.920]   Flick your wrist just right.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:38.840]   But notifications are really small, no more than 23% of use if you include the two there.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.560]   And activity is maybe 10% of the use.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.200]   That's what people say they get the watch for.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.560]   They say they get the watch so they don't have to get the phone out of the pocket to
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.120]   see who's calling or just, they say they get it because it monitors their activity and
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.160]   they can become more healthy.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   The next thing they say is they don't.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   They use it mostly to see what time it is.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.920]   But I think for me, the original pitch for the watch was that if you're like me and you're
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.880]   pulling the watch, your phone out of your pocket 100 times a day, each phone interaction
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.600]   by the time you unlock it and see what it is and think about whether it's about a minute.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   And the average interaction that they found in this Swedish study was something like it
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.120]   was less than seven seconds.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.760]   And for looking at the watch, for looking at what time it is and we're looking at notifications,
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.600]   we're talking about, yeah, with 3.8, 9.2 seconds.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.200]   Anyway, you replace the idea of replacing a one minute interaction with a three or four
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.480]   or five second interaction.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.040]   There's a business to be made there.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   I guess.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   It's not huge.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.440]   And it's a subset of the iPhone market, which is really what Apple cares about.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   Right.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:03.760]   The watch, the Apple's business revolves around the sun that is the iPhone.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:12.800]   And every other, the watch, the TV, the iPad, the Mac now are all peripheral to the phone
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.040]   and to the extent to which you buy into any of those peripheral products, you're more
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.360]   likely to buy a phone and stick with the phone.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.400]   So anyway, it's a little defensive because I think there's a lot of people that, like,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.640]   the conventional wisdom is that the watch is a bust.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.840]   And we don't have the Black Friday numbers yet, but my guess is that they're going to
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.280]   come out better than Wall Street thinks and certainly better than the naysayers.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.720]   The analysts say they're showing about a million a month.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   That's not a bad business.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   Not too heavy.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.440]   As far as the activity part you're talking about, you also have to remember that unless
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.360]   you have one of the newer Fitbits, 90% of those pedometers don't show you your steps.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.800]   Like I see people like, I friends that wear the jawbone that I used to have and you just
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.880]   see girls like just doing high steps.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   So what are you doing?
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   I'm getting my steps in.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.640]   They can't see every steps they're doing, but they're doing them.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   So same thing with your watch.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.480]   I don't check my steps until the end of the day or like when I'm riding my bike, I
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   write my bike, I set it up.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.080]   But you think about it, you know that you're doing it.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.520]   You don't have to check and say, oh, I took five steps today.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.920]   So no, you're not doing that because that's not even a natural thing to do.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.160]   Most of those devices sync to your phone and you look at it at the end of the day or if
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.280]   you think you've been too lazy, you know, they give this gives you the nudge you've
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.360]   been sitting for an hour, makes you think about it.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.240]   So no, then I go in and check an activity like, oh, I burned 300 calories.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.000]   I don't do it for the last two hours.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.800]   Not something that you normally do, but most of those devices don't do that per se.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.080]   I think you flying roaches in a chatroom, God, he said they've left out a fairly hefty
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.720]   percent, like 50%.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   It's really just for you to show other people.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.120]   I have an Apple watch.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   The my tag.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.360]   Have you seen the my tag shows in person?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.560]   No, what's that?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:02.320]   MIT AGG.com is a beautiful, beautiful stand with elegant lines and an LED light.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.880]   Oh, I want this.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.240]   Yeah, you do.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.640]   That's my new birthday present.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.440]   How do I get out of this?
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440]   Get away.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   I hate this.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.320]   No, I don't want to give you my email address in the corner off of it.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   Click off of it.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   You go away.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   Thank you.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   God, I hate that.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   It's the first time.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.160]   It's my email address.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.720]   The new doc power lamp station, 179 bucks.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.000]   That thing is pretty.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.800]   You can get it in brushed aluminum AK silver or space gray to match your whatever your
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   iPhone.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.280]   Oh, you can get it with or without Nookie.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   What's that?
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.880]   I have no idea what that is.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   You don't know what Nookie is?
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.680]   Oh, oh wait a minute.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.000]   Nookie is the portable battery.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   Well, I don't know why you would need Nookie.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   Oh, anyway.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.560]   Trying so hard not to sing.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.880]   I know you're doing good.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.200]   I'm really I'm it's fun to kind of just watch you steam come out of yours.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   I know.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   It's a horrible situation.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   But does that thing pretty and elegant and LEDified and sounds like a good birthday present?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.840]   Yeah, it looks gorgeous.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   When you said anyone.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   ASAP.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   More expensive with Nookie.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.240]   Isn't it always there you go.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   There you go.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   I gave you an ice one.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   That's good.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   That's good.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   That's good.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Always alone.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   I try.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   I kept I kept trying.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.240]   I kept giving the opening.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   He finally fell right in.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.680]   And I think it's really incumbent upon third party developers to come up with transcendent
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.560]   Apple Watch apps, which they have.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   What they have.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.920]   I think for certain people there are certain apps which are a big deal.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.480]   But there's nothing that people see and say, Oh my God, I need to get the Apple Watch
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.280]   in order to do this thing as opposed to something like an act the iPhone.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.640]   There are dozens of apps which are so compelling.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.960]   You might get an iPhone just to use them.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.200]   And there's nothing like that for the Apple Watch or for Android where you have except
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.920]   for notifications, which a lot of people are by themselves.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   Oh, you know, for instance, I have a chat app on my iPhone called the IRC chat.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.680]   Whenever my name is mentioned in the chat room, it not only shows up on my phone, it shows
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   up on the watch.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.800]   And I was in the movies last night and I was going, stop it.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   Stop it.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.640]   Sometimes notifications are not a good thing.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   You get too many notifications.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   You get smart watches in general are a pain in a theater.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   You put it on silent.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   There's a button for that.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.480]   Yeah, it turns out it took me a while to figure this out.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   I actually have to go to the iPhone and change the notification settings for that application.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.280]   But you can also just swipe up and then hit the silent button like I did right now.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   Oh, oh, not getting notifications like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, just say it's silent.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.480]   Yeah, it's turned off as well.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   Super simple.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   Yeah, airplane mode.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.880]   If you don't like airplane mode, that's what I should have done.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   All kinds of things.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.680]   And then I can just throw the watch away because it's not connected to anything.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   Who needs it?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   Good to go.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   Pro tip.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   Pro tip.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.080]   Thought it would be nicer if it knew that I was in a movie theater because of your GPS
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.840]   on my phone to locate me and then shut it off automatically.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   It could be smarter.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.880]   So just ask miracles.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.800]   And when we come back, will there be an Apple Watch 2 this year?
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.040]   Or is Apple going to, I don't know what, hold off?
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   We shall talk more.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.280]   Philip Elmer DeWitt is here.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   Long time Apple Watcher, but also a great writer for Fortune at Fortune.com from Fast
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.400]   Company, Harry McCracken.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.880]   And from nowhere but his own self.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.200]   Oh, and JJ still.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.440]   Oh, what is, so is IQMZ launched?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.600]   I have a whole bunch of tools in the can.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   It's launched and it crashed.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.080]   It's kind of like I was down and out for two weeks.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   Oh, you were.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   You feeling better?
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   I am 100% better.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   Did you get that fluid?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.480]   I got a new, I got a new, I got a new, I got stripped from a daughter and all the kids
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.400]   in school and then I saw a doctor who prescribed me the wrong medicine and put me in the hole.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   It was a bad situation.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.200]   So that's another thing.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.320]   We should have a hot conversation about that.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.960]   What the hell is going on with medical care in this country?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   It's getting worse.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.560]   We're paying more and we're getting less.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.600]   I got in the best situation because I'm not allergic to anything.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.680]   So when they asked me that question all the time, oh, were you allergic to this or to
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   that?
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.560]   I always say no because as far as I've known, I've never been allergic.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.800]   So they gave me a medication that they normally don't give and I happen to apparently be allergic
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   to it.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Oh, geez.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.040]   And I kept taking it, trying to get better and I kept getting worse and then I'm thinking
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.000]   there's something else is wrong and I'm like, so it was a whole to do.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.360]   But I am, I'm like back to 100% now.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   So I'm good.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   But you have a kid in school.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   So it's pretty much guaranteed you're going to get some.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   Yeah, it's it travels home.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   It really does.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   You know what I hate?
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.680]   I hate losing money on an old gadget.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   That's what I hate.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.320]   That's why I go to Gazelle, the online marketplace for selling your old stuff, trading your device
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   for cash.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   You wouldn't throw a hundred dollar bill in a drawer to gather dust.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.800]   Why are you throwing that old smartphone or tablet in the drawer when you're done with
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   it?
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.880]   Give just go to Gazelle and get a quote.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.360]   You may be amazed.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.240]   Yours quote is good for 30 days, by the way, which is nice.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   Shipping is free.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.320]   Payment is fast.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.160]   And if you're looking to buy a certified pre own device, replace say a broken or lost
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   phone.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.680]   Gazelle is a variety of iPhones and iPads and Samsung Galaxy phones to choose from.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.280]   And the nice thing about buying Gazelle, every device is fully inspected.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.520]   They have a 30 point check list, including things like, you know, no big scratches, things
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   like that.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.640]   They're back with a 30 day return policy.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   When you buy, you can choose the quality like new or slightly used so that, you know,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.800]   you can you can get replaced your your phone in, you know, pretty much the same condition
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   it was.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.760]   They're always sold without carrier contract, but they do work in all the major carriers,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.360]   AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.840]   Now that the new iPhone is here, the new iPad also here.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.760]   Now is the best time to buy a certified pre own device because there's a lot of people
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.320]   trading up and you can take advantage of that.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.920]   Gazelle has an incredible selection of quality pre own devices at great prices.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.200]   iPhone four S through six plus for iPads.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   They got standard.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   They got errors.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   They got your minis.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   I like the mini.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.120]   They can even cater to Android users with the Galaxy phones there.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:33.720]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, give new life to used electronics, trade them in for cash or buy certified pre own.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.000]   If you're feeling a little, you know, bad about the landfill and all that, all that stuff
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.800]   going on in the landfill, gazelle.com is the responsible way to kind of pay it forward.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.920]   Gazelle, you like that iPad?
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.280]   I find the iPad pro awfully big.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.920]   It is large, but I'm trying to use it as my primary computer.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.320]   So doing serious writing, it's good for great big spreadsheets.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   Makes me long for my mini.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.000]   I have actually if Burke or somebody would get my iPad pro and the pencil and everything,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.480]   I also got the Apple keyboard and I got the Logitech.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.840]   I like the Logitech better, but it's so big and heavy.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.360]   Yeah, it's a little bit cumbersome just in terms of not other sides of the keyboard,
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.920]   but the whole package.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.080]   But the Apple keyboard is hard.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.640]   It's a chiclet, so it's hard to take on.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   It doesn't move.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   Keys don't move.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.720]   It looks really chiclety, but after years, it took me about two days until I was able to
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   go at the same speed I was with anything else.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.960]   And your fingers aren't sore?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   No, not at all.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   And it's nice and thin.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.480]   Do you think it's going to be a hit?
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.760]   I think for certain type of people, including me, it is ideal and the big question is how
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.040]   many of those people are there?
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.480]   Most people are not going to buy it.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.280]   Most people will not buy this handle laptop because it's the price of a pretty nice laptop.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.720]   Yeah, when I think about what I paid for this thing.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.920]   I think artists will go gaga for it.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   Pencil is just great.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.600]   Pencil is just fantastic.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.760]   If you like to draw and paint.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.520]   This is much like you were saying for the Apple Watch.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.680]   If the apps appear that support this unique form factor, by the way, how does this work?
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.440]   You have to snap it on.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.640]   You have to put it on the iPad on so it looks like it's upside down.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.560]   And then you go like yay.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.520]   This is great.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.640]   No, no.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.200]   It's like you have it on backwards, I think.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.000]   Oh, Johnny, I was really great.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   It just works.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Yeah, I've had like 170 bucks.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.680]   It is an accordion, basically.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.240]   All right, there.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   I got it.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   There we go.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   There you go.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   Where's your pen?
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.680]   Oh, it's right here.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.240]   Right here.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.800]   And you know, actually, I have to say now you can use notes, but you know, you're going
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.040]   to want to use like a paper from 53 or one of the papers.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.520]   Great procreate is really good.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.440]   I've been using something called sketches.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.920]   Oh, I haven't tried that.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.480]   Procreate is more like an art, but it's nice because you have a variety of brushes.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   This is 53.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.520]   You have a variety of brushes and styles.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's pretty fast.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.560]   I've been able to get ahead of it, but it's fairly low latency and it feels, you know,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   it's interesting.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.200]   They say the nibs wear out.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   It comes with a spare.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.080]   So that means that there, I don't know.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.840]   I mean, it's glass.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   What would that?
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.160]   That's true of any of these digital stylists.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   They wear out.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.800]   The tip can wear out.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.920]   This is the ruler.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.480]   The ruler.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.360]   Let's tap the ruler.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   I don't know.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.120]   I'm not doing it right.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.880]   What do I do?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   Huh?
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.920]   Use it to draw a square.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.480]   Use it to draw a square.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.680]   Well, oh, it just, well, that's cool.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   What happens if you draw a circle?
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   It becomes a circle.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   It cleans it up.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.120]   Oh, oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   It's thinking.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.800]   Welcome to Samsung tablets.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   1980.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Shut up.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   You're making me.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.240]   This is like Visio in 1992.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Really?
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.880]   Like, I don't know who, when you talk about artists wanting this, the Wacom tablet that
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.560]   has Android in it and you can use Photoshop and everything like that without having a
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   computer.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.480]   I see tons of kids rocking those things.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   Oh, really?
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.040]   And for the price point, I don't know if you're going to, I have to see this with Photoshop
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.120]   and CAD to know if that's the legit star to work with that.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.040]   The pencil does feel amazing.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.920]   Looks amazing, all that stuff.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.720]   But when I see artists using those Wacom tablets, they are fierce with those things and they
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   just work.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   And I'm out of the curve.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   By the way, this, you're right.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   As I'm in the chat, I'm going to say it's from 53.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   It's called paper.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.240]   But if I say paper, what am I doing?
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.120]   This is paper by 53 or just, I just call it 53.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.160]   There are like three different apps called paper.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.320]   There's Dropbox paper.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   There's Facebook paper.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   Yeah, it's too generic.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.640]   But see, the icon says 53.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.600]   There's also a 53 pencil, which is no relation to the Apple pencil.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.840]   I drew this this morning.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.560]   I thought I was pretty proud of it.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.200]   No, I didn't.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.920]   Wish I did.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   Somebody did, not me.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.440]   Really, all I can do is to face paintings now.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.640]   It's really good for that, but that's about it.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.080]   I could draw a mustache on the bird.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   I love Photoshop on an actual computer.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.040]   I don't like Photoshop on something which is touch-centric because Photoshop still has
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.520]   15,000 too many features, which get in the way.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.640]   It has dropped down menus, which were never, which were always designed for a mouse pointer.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.680]   Personally, I think there is a total need for something like the iPad Pro that specifically
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   because it does not run Photoshop in this full-blown form.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   They have various little works.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.120]   Adobe is trying to break down Photoshop and do its core components and do standalone
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.560]   apps which were designed for touch.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.000]   Has anybody ever talked to colleague refers?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.400]   I mean, they show calligraphy in the Apple of videos, but I don't know if a calligrapher
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.920]   is very much part of the calligraphy is the pen nib on paper and the friction that that's
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   creating.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.880]   I don't know if a calligrapher would like this or not.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.600]   That's why they showed that they can have you have that exact feeling of what you just
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.000]   said, whether people use it or not for that.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.600]   It makes you feel like it's right.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.840]   For calligraphy, it kind of feels like cheating though because you can use a calligraphy tool
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.760]   that has the heavy lifting for you.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.960]   Well that's the kind of calligraphy I do.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   So that's okay.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.160]   This is not for me for sure, but go ahead.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.240]   Well, it just sort of feels like there's got to be vertical markets where it's totally
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.080]   appropriate.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.720]   My fiance who's an architect actually got cold called by Apple or maybe by IBM working
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:40.200]   for Apple saying would you like us to come in and give your shop a demo of this new
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   tool?
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.440]   And I thought that was really smart.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.080]   It sounds like they're really going after the enterprise market.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.800]   And then she called back and said, yeah, please schedule me.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.520]   And they never followed up.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520]   What?
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.760]   Yeah, so isn't that Apple for you?
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.520]   They almost get the enterprise.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.600]   They almost get the enterprise and then they just don't have it quite right.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.960]   So this is cool.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   Fun for gaming.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Did you do that?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.040]   Yeah, I did that all by myself.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.680]   No, this is a game called a Strangers Wrath, which was one of my favorite games in the Xbox.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.800]   I don't know how to get through the cuts.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.840]   What's the advantage of doing it on them?
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   It's giant.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   It's big.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.640]   Plants versus zombies.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.840]   Giant.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.280]   And for most, and this is part of the problem also.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   It's new.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   Maybe this will change.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.760]   But for most apps, they haven't taken advantage of the extra space.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   Even Apple hasn't.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   Look at the grid layout.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   Yeah, the desktop.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.280]   I mean, every icon has its own zip code basically.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.560]   So even Apple hasn't really-- but I imagine in time, I don't think Apple is going to change
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   springboards.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   It's a little bit buggy, too.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.240]   Like when you plug it in at night, it tends to freeze up and you need to do a hard reset
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   more than--
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   But that's not good.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.200]   And then, of course, the pan you charge, which is-- this is really weird.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.080]   Fortunately, you don't have to do it very often.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:11.280]   The pan you charge by sticking in the-- they do give you a adapter.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   Dapper.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.280]   It's a plug with.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   But it's kind of weird, isn't it?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.680]   Apple in their adapters.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Apple adapters.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   They don't know.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.520]   My wake-up tablet doesn't need batteries.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.520]   It just works.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.000]   The fact they walk doesn't need batteries is one of the coolest things in the history
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   of tech.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Right.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.440]   The Surface pan doesn't need a battery.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440]   They're not chargeables.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.120]   It's a-- they're replaceable, too.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   They're not chargeables.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.840]   It's a AAAA, which I didn't even know existed.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   I know.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   I used the Surface.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   I like the Surface a lot.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   I use the Surface book.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.160]   And I like it a lot, because I do think touch is natural.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.040]   But this feels more constrained, a little bit more constrained with it.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.960]   I don't know.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.600]   Where's the battery settings?
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.800]   I want to see my-- see if I can see the battery usage on the pen.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.880]   Oh, it doesn't show the pen.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Where I stand?
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.760]   And there's-- if you do pull down at the top, there's a little widget.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.320]   And then I'll put it in there.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   That's right.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   It's here.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   So, oh, wow.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.320]   I've already used 50% of the pencil.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   But look.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.120]   It's-- because it was 100% four days ago.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.240]   So I don't know why, but look how fast it's charging up.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   You can almost see it.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.640]   The charge is pretty quickly.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   So anyway, I don't know why.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.200]   I just saw that you used it, and I thought I'd ask you how you like it.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   For me, it's great.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.840]   I think it's-- I mean, I think it's also cool that Apple is doing the first iOS device
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.240]   which is sort of a computer.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.880]   I think it will lead to good things over time.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:39.280]   No, I have to sit here with this sticking out of my iPad Pro until it charges up.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   No, you can pull up.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   No, you don't.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   You just unplug it.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   You're not doing anything.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   You're not writing any novels right now.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.120]   But I don't want it to die in the middle of my special painting.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.040]   I just top mine off periodically.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.640]   Oh, you could turn it off?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.400]   You can just-- I just stick it in for like two minutes, and then I pull it out.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.400]   Oh, top it off.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   I use it like an ink well.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   I'm topping off right now.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.360]   Will there be an Apple Watch this year, Philip Elmer DeWitt?
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   There is an Apple Watch.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.360]   Will there be a new one?
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   No, that's what I think.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   I wouldn't.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.800]   It doesn't feel right to me.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:17.320]   I mean, Apple is learning that these products have natural cycles.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.480]   The phone used to be two years.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.960]   They're trying to push it up to one year.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   The max, you know, what do they have?
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.800]   Four, five, six-year lifespan.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.520]   The iPad, they guessed wrong.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.040]   They thought people were going to upgrade more frequently, and they don't.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.640]   So the watch doesn't feel like an every year product to me.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:48.480]   What I could see is this sort of monthification of Apple where you start buying stuff like
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   you know, with the automatic upgrade thing, you do with the watch, with the phone.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.800]   I could see people doing that with the watch.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:01.040]   And if you've bought it that way and you can get a new watch when the next one comes out,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.400]   I could see that happening.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   Otherwise, I mean, I bought the cheapest one possible because I figured that the real watch
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.800]   will be the one that has a cell phone in it.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.440]   And it doesn't have to be paired with your iPhone.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.640]   LG or Bane too was supposed to have a cell phone in it.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.000]   It was great for the 9 days that existed or whatever it runs by.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.360]   There was some technical issue with the display I gather.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.040]   But also it's about battery life.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.120]   I think that's got these too, yeah.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.640]   Apple looks like they just made something that would recharge.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.280]   You could just recharge it overnight.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.760]   And that was as good as they could get.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:46.560]   And they're not going to put out a watch that you have to recharge more frequently than
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   that.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   Right.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.120]   You can't apparently can't put a cell phone in this particular watch and still have a
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.440]   one day recharge.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.160]   So it will be a while.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   Battery technology improves at a glacial pace.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:09.360]   And probably when the when the when the energy requirements of cell phone chips and battery
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.560]   meat, that's when they'll put out the watch that I really want.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.600]   The reason the simple reason why there's not going to be another watch right now probably
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   is going to be at least every two years cycles because it doesn't do anything.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.480]   I mean, other than the fact of me liking this watch, there's no real reason for me to want
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   this watch.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.280]   Like I have people ask me all the time, should I get one or I was going to come out with a
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   new one?
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.120]   I'm like, no, just get one because there's not going to be a new one coming out anytime
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.800]   soon because there's no killer new thing to tell me.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   And thinner, lighter, faster is all cookies and whatever.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.920]   But the watch doesn't have a killer app yet or anything driving it besides the fact of
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.360]   them possibly being a thinner.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.000]   I mean, putting a camera and it's not going to do it for me.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.360]   It feels fine wearing it.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.560]   So until they have something like dramatic that would make them want to buy it like what
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.440]   I can imagine, they can't come out another one right away.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.600]   They have to wait.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.280]   So it's safe to safe to buy an Apple watch as a Christmas gift.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   Yeah, building GPS would be nice.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.520]   Yeah, some many many companies are doing that already.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.680]   I was able to do everything you were just excited about a square that went on your tablet
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.000]   and turned to a real square.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.320]   So you think that whole thing that we know that we should be done, they'll wait and make
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.120]   you wait so they need to go.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.960]   I have to say, having a phone on this is not my idea of a great, mostly because I feel
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.760]   like the interface on these small devices, not just the Apple watch, but all small devices
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.240]   is tough.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.200]   And if you're going to add a phone now, you got a dialer, how am I going to dial it?
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.000]   What am I going to need to have toothpick to dial it?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Voice dial.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   This is America.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   We live in the future.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.320]   What are you talking about?
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   Talk to it, huh?
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.720]   And you just push faces.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.480]   You got the spin dial with the 10 people.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.560]   What you mean dial on phone or you ain't dialing on numbers.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.120]   Does that work for you really?
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.120]   I mean, isn't that a movie trope, but I think a true one that are telling me.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   I do it all the time.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.360]   You go, call on the kitchen.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.960]   Call on the doctor and it goes calling your mom.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   No, no.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.440]   The dictation on this is great.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.520]   I respond to a million text messages.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   I respond voice via text on this before my iPhone and this is more accurate to my iPhone.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   I don't know why.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.560]   I don't know if it's because I'm talk.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.360]   I don't know, but this thing is accurate.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.040]   As far as voice text dictation.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   So when you say talk to the hand, you mean talk to the watch.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.600]   That I realize.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.400]   Doctor, do you answer phone calls on the watch?
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.480]   Yes, I do.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.320]   At least five, 10 times a week.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   I'm like, I'm like, okay, here we are.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   Number one is a shortcut.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.080]   Okay, I'm down here.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   What?
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   It doesn't sound like that.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   I'm in the kitchen.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.280]   My phone's upstairs in office.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.720]   And I say, what is it?
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.240]   Is it important if it's not important?
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.280]   I'll call you back when I get to my phone.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.440]   But at least I can answer the call since people don't blow my phone up or I don't miss
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.560]   the call because we'll somebody's dying in the streets and they need me.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   Sometimes you got to take that call.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.680]   Hey, man, are you a professional lifesaver?
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   I'm a superhero.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.400]   Don't worry about what I'm doing.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   There you go.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.840]   There's an article for you with Superman, where an Apple watch.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.360]   He gave Jimmy a watch, didn't he?
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   Watch is very important to Superman.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.160]   He cares about time.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   Especially when he turns the planet backwards.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.200]   He sounds it only he can hear.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   And then he can go save people.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.400]   Philip Elmer, this was a good article idea.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.440]   You decided to query IBM's Watson and Google about interest in the Apple watch.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.320]   And they came up with diametrically opposed results.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.160]   Yeah, it actually has shifted a little bit today.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:38.240]   But yesterday, the watch was pegged at 100.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:45.840]   On the scale of 0 to 100, it was on IBM's super smart Watson that beats people at Jeopardy,
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.640]   that's the world chess champion.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.720]   They decided to stick it, you know, to apply it to the market and then you look that go
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   back a little bit.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.000]   Or Watson has really come down in the world.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.520]   See, the Apple watch is pinned at 100% or--
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.200]   You can't get higher than that, right?
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.240]   So it just finally fell.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.280]   The last one is down to 77 or something.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.080]   But wait a minute.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.960]   Why all of a sudden?
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:17.040]   Well, one person, one someone suggested that if they bought the watches a gift on Friday,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.240]   then they're not talking about it anymore.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   They're lost interest, yeah.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.880]   But I just don't believe it, because if you look at the same chart, the phone is two.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.320]   The watch is 100 and the phone is two.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.000]   Well, you know, we know that they're going to sell at least 70 million phones, maybe
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.600]   75, maybe 77 million phones this quarter.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.880]   Apple will be lucky to sell 6 million watches.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.640]   They're off by a factor of 10.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.080]   So I just don't understand what this IBM thing is measuring.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:49.440]   I mean, when you go to Google Trends to test it, it's the opposite.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.880]   The watch is two and the phone is 48.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880]   So anyway--
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.040]   Well, when IBM's Watson is monitoring on, it says online conversations.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   Right.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   Like the NSA?
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.000]   Like what?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.240]   Like anything that they can get their hands on.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.040]   They're looking at public reviews.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.440]   They're looking at Twitter feeds, looking at Facebook, that kind of stuff.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.920]   I don't think conversation maps to purchases though, because people buy a heck of a lot
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.960]   of Windows laptops, but there's not incessant chatter about most Windows laptops compared
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   to--
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   I can't wait.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   I'm going to buy a Windows laptop.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.960]   I'm so excited.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   I saw it was Acer last week.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:25.960]   It was both, right?
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   I can't believe.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:31.960]   There's a lot to say about the Apple Watch just because it's new.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.840]   And it's unclear where it's going.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   And a Windows laptop is so mature that there's just not a lot to be said about it, even though
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.520]   it's useful and people are buying them.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:46.000]   So the red line on this graph from Google is the phone and the blue line at the bottom
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   there is the--
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.680]   Even the iPhone is pretty mature at this point.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   There's less to say about it.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   These are these searches?
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   That's searches.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.240]   And that's actually-- I think it's the first derivative.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.440]   That's how much search has changed.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   If I read Google Croats--
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   Gross.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   So it's gross.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   And search--
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   Yeah, or growth or falling off.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.360]   And it's a lot bigger in Singapore than it is in Australia.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.440]   I believe that people are talking about the Apple Watch.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.080]   I think that's true.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.360]   I don't think-- like Harry says, I don't think it translates necessarily translate
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.360]   to sales.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.160]   Search results would translate more to sales, though, right?
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.840]   Search means you're looking for somewhere to buy it.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.880]   Blackberry has well under 1% market share, which you would never know from reading text
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.800]   sites, where Blackberry is still a really well covered product.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.600]   And people still seem to be interested in talking about it.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.680]   Let's put in the Blackberry as a search term here.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.520]   My Blackberry Priv comes tomorrow.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.040]   I'm so excited.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.960]   All right.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.400]   So now-- oh, what I don't know what I've done.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   I guess you've--
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   There's a tiny, tiny line.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.160]   Go back up to right to the right of iPhone there.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   Add turn.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.720]   Let's see where Blackberry is on this list.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.160]   This is fun.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.600]   It's doing better than the Apple Watch.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.880]   Yes, so that's not nothing.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.040]   It's not nothing.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   Yep.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040]   Hmm.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   I've got the Google people that write examples.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.040]   The scale is November.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.040]   I'm not going to care about it.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.440]   The scale goes-- nobody's talking about the Apple Watch in 2012 because there wasn't
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.440]   one.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.480]   OK, so let's-- I've got to change the scale a little bit here.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.280]   I couldn't figure out how to change the scale.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.120]   Yeah, all right.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.280]   So when you get a little more up to date, then the Apple Watch is getting parody with
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.120]   the Blackberry, but the iPhone's dominating.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.440]   I think where it says 2004 to present up at the top.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   Change this.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.440]   Change it in the last--
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.440]   Oh, there you go.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   There you go.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.640]   Hey, you know, that's why they call it a technologizer.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.760]   In the last 90 days, now we're still pretty much the same result.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   Interesting.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   You can put things like Amazon and Google.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.200]   Google swamps everything here, but I think that's because people--
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.760]   They search Google for Google?
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.400]   They do Google searches and that, you know, it pops up.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   It's just fun.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.120]   What is it, general term of life?
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.280]   Mom, how far is it to Google it?
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.200]   Oh, you know, that's the Google.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   Google it.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   Everybody says Google.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   By the way, good news.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   Any questions anymore?
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.440]   My Apple pencil is now fully charged at 100%.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.440]   Do you feel better about yourself?
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.560]   Yeah, I only use 2% of my iPad battery doing it.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.600]   Well, draw another circle and make it perfect because it's your birthday and you can do
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   what you want.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.640]   Thank you, Doctor, for permission.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   You're welcome.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.600]   Did you get a present?
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   A present?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   For my birthday?
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   A birthday present?
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   No.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.880]   When you get to this age, also you get people calling to see if you're still alive.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   I was going to say we're just happy he woke up today.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.600]   He came and get his little reticid over there, but we can't get a triangle full.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.960]   Yeah, that's another thing that happens when you get to 59.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.080]   It was like the new final things today.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   He's kids and girls.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   Watch these things.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   Get off my lawn.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.440]   That's it.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.040]   We talked about Christmas gift apparently, though.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.560]   Phillip, you don't even need to go to work anymore.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:02.480]   You just use IBM Watson and Google and you could get an article after a reams of articles.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.800]   The Samsung, same thing.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.360]   Samsung TV, very big.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:14.040]   But that's because Samsung was cutting its price by 50% on its website of all of its
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   TVs.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.400]   They still are a black Friday deal.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.200]   It was pretty spectacular.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.040]   We were kind of wondering what that was all about.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   I guess they're clearing them out.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.840]   The normal present this year is a hoverboard.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.000]   Yeah, because I'm a real trendsetter.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   I gave my son a hoverboard in August.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.440]   That's because you're a year.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.520]   It's damaged already.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.760]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   Now you've raised because I started doing research and it becomes very confusing.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.920]   The original hoverboard, those are the hoverboard.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.120]   It's not, they don't hover.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   They're those two wheels.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   It's the Samsung.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   It's the two wheels.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   It's the two wheels.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.680]   It's like a segue.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.600]   And so the original one was made by a Chinese company which was immediately ripped off
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.800]   by 50 other Chinese companies.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.440]   And it doesn't seem clear which one is superior to any other.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   They're all the same kind of.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   I think they're all the same.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.840]   Are they so funs better than the cheap ones?
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.880]   Well, and then there's a huge variation in price from $200 to $1,200.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.520]   So some of the things that are different is the battery and maybe two miles per hour
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.680]   on speed.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   And some of the more expensive ones has a Bluetooth link to your phone so you can gauge
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.320]   the battery and know what the battery is.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.320]   I was just like, yeah.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.800]   As opposed to guessing.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:28.600]   But for the most part in general, you step on it and it goes and you, that's how it works.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.440]   So the general purpose of them all is the same.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.840]   And the price variant is nothingness.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.200]   I mean, you can get them on eBay right now for like $150 bucks or $1 bucks.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.000]   Are you a funky dunk or an I/O hawk?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.040]   I don't like to wear funky dunk so I guess.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:50.240]   Funky dunk got a big hit because somebody, Snoop Dogg or somebody rode a funky dunk on
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.240]   to a Jimmy Fallon.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.040]   But that's the thing.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.680]   All if you, well, if you were as well connected to the world as I am, I mean, there's endorsements
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.120]   of every which way brand possible.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.440]   I mean, everybody's, get the free from, you know, Wiz Khalifa got arrested on one airport.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.400]   It was Jamie Fox, by the way, here he is on his funky duck.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.760]   So they're in TV show now.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.640]   I saw my favorite video is a, they said when you find out your pastor's been spending
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   church money the wrong way.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:25.440]   And the church procession comes out and in the pastor comes scooting out on a funky dunk.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:32.120]   I saw a guy in the street on a single wheel segue with, it was just the wheel.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   That's just dopey.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.640]   Yeah, those have been around for even a little bit longer.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   Okay.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:46.760]   So the I/O hawk, which is kind of ironic, they, they are literally rebranding an existing,
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.400]   an existing Chinese companies.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:56.480]   And, and to the point where they named their logo after a rotated version of the logo that
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.760]   the Chinese company was using.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.040]   So the Chinese could be a circle with a bar over it.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.480]   And they said, Oh, if we turn on a site, it looks like I/O.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   We'll call it the I/O hawk.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.800]   They need a bother changing the logo.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   So I don't know.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   I bought my son one, but I care.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.760]   I think I bought him one just out of, just out of, just out of decency.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.200]   I bought him one wired, had a whole art of, why don't you buy all the employees one for
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   Christmas?
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   No, because they're expensive.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.200]   That's why.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.680]   And they'll put themselves, you get, you get an Abu Dhabi is great.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   They can screw around the office.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   They'll be faster work.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.240]   You can get them for like a hundred bucks if you buy like 10 of them.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.200]   So you can get a 10 of them for a grand.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   That's nothing.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.680]   You spent that on a tablet that draws circles and makes them perfect for you.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.920]   It's not a big deal.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   All out.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.680]   Abu Dhabi's that kind of is like the Amazon for the rest of the world.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Just get, get like 10 of them.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.600]   You might as well, they're probably cheaper there.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.600]   And they're the same.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.640]   You buy them in bulk, you get the middle of 10 and you get them for a hundred bucks apiece.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.680]   I'm not saying I know, but I'm just saying I know.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.400]   I'm just saying I ended up buying the one that originally invented it because I felt
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.880]   like they deserve my money.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.080]   Well, that's what they're doing.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.360]   They're going to the Abu Dhabi site.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.720]   Like I said, if you buy a minimum of 10, you get them for a hundred.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.320]   If you buy 500 years, you can get them for like 50 bucks.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.000]   Then they go put them on Instagram and give one a Snoop Dogg and charge people four or
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.440]   500 bucks for it.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.880]   And they're just buying them from the same company and dishing them out.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:18.200]   Let me add Hoverboard to our terms of Apple Watch iPhone, Blackberry, Hoverboard.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.280]   What are your predictions?
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.080]   Well, Hoverboard be 3,000 percent better.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.400]   Yeah, I figure it would be, but actually it's not.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:24.920]   No.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.280]   Hoverboard's right in there with the Apple Watch.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:33.720]   Is the eye, look at the dominance of the iPhone.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.760]   Hoverboard's like the same as a Blackberry.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   Hmm.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Hmm.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   I don't know.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   Everybody's the one.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.120]   Let's look over the last year.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.760]   I bet the Hoverboard's bigger earlier in the year, right?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.920]   Is that going to be the Hoverboard?
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.960]   No, see, there's a little jump right there with the Apple Watch.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.800]   Is that the thing that's searching Instagram?
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.400]   Because I'm telling you, every from Justin Bieber to Soulja.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.280]   Everybody's got one and they're all peddling a different brand.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:06.400]   My son got on Tosh.0 with his Hoverboard video.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.760]   Maybe the search isn't good enough because they're not calling it Hoverboard.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   They're all calling different things.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.960]   That's the other thing.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.320]   People are stilling over who owns what, right to it and all that kind of stuff now.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:21.680]   So I bought Henry, his Hoverboard for his birthday in August.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.160]   And let me see the clip.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   Where's the clip?
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   Why is the clip not showing?
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.400]   I want to show off.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   He got on Tosh.0.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   Oh, yeah?
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.400]   Yeah, crashing his Hoverboard.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Did he flow?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.600]   I was going to say he must have fell.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   [laughter]
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.800]   Something bad had to happen for it to make it to Tosh.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Oh, I guess after what?
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   Oh, that's three days.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   Welcome to Tosh.0.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Hover joust.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.440]   Why isn't it playing?
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.440]   It's not playing.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.640]   Have you updated your credits?
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   Oh, you know what?
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   I turned off...
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   I have an ad blocker running.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   What do you think?
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   You think that's probably doing it?
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.520]   You probably can't see it with the ad blocker.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.440]   Yep, that's it.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.960]   Not allowed because they want you to see the ads.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.120]   Yeah, this has nothing to do.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:07.920]   Your content will return shortly after we go through the North Pole and see Cartoon.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.120]   You can't even skip this.
