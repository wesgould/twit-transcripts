[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.520]   Well, and for some reason, I don't know,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   there was a mix up on the factory floor,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.560]   and every single one of our hosts is in studio today.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   I think that's a blue moon.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   It happens every once in a while.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   I'll start over here with John C. de Vorak,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.960]   also known as Brian Wilson in his Beach Boy shirt.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.120]   You look good.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.880]   Do you have a little box of sand for your bare feet?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   I do, and they're sitting in it right now.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.680]   They can move the camera down and see him.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.520]   They can't do that.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.200]   He's coming from the know-agend-to-show,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.400]   knowagend-to-show.com and channeled davorak.com.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280]   Also, here from CNET Reviews editor, Lindsay Turntime,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   you might see her every week.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.560]   Every Monday.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.360]   Every Monday on Tech News today.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.240]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.080]   Thank you.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.240]   I've never met you, I don't think.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   This is a very strange note.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.240]   We have not met.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.080]   Have we ever worked together?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.960]   No.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.080]   I can't believe that.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.920]   I know.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   You've been at CNET for how long?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   15 years.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.680]   Shh.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   You must have--
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   They put me in a closet in the back,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120]   so I just kind of stay there.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   15 years.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   Right years.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   What was CNET doing in 1999?
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   CNET was.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.360]   It was a TV network.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.720]   Well, actually CNET launched as a TV network.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   Right.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   It was originally a cable.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   I was a third employee.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.200]   John and I were on their first pilot.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Remember that, John?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   I had my hair was like Michael Douglas.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   It was like lacquered.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   So in 1999--
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   You looked at a different voice.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   I did.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   I diked like this.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   No.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   In '99, the website had happened.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.920]   It had been going for a few years and it had sort of taken off.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   The website was originally launched as kind of a pet project of the show.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   It was like, hey, there's this web thing.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.680]   Well, the only minor was very smart because I think he realized that the TV wasn't the
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   be all and end all, but it was a great vehicle for promoting a website.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.280]   And by 1999, it was apparent that you could make money on the web.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.080]   And the website just took off.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.160]   And it was growing when I started.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.480]   It was growing really, very quickly.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.040]   And in fact, the big money maker, and I think it's probably still the case, was always been
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   reviews, right?
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.360]   Well, reviews are very important.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   I mean, everybody knows from an advertising perspective that it's important to be there
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.400]   whether the review is positive or not.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   Right on.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.800]   It's better to be there than to not be there.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   So, yeah.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   So good to have you.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Also, a newbie on Twitch.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400]   Well, not also because Lindsay was here once before.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   But it's so great to have you.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.520]   Not a newbie on the network, but a newbie on the show, Alan Malvittano.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.200]   We have been a huge fan of Alan for a long time.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I quote you all the time.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Thank you.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.680]   He is the SSD expert.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.880]   And a reviewer now full time at a PC perspective, former Navy chief.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   That's how we met Submariner.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yes.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.960]   How much time under the ocean?
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   Have you spent?
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   Have I spent?
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.200]   I mean, I did 10 patrols.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   There were three months each.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.920]   So 30 months under the water.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.200]   You go squirrely three months, you know, without air.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   We make the hand.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   We make it.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   We got a pull in.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   We're out of air.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.480]   No, but it's a tight, it's a close base.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.640]   It's trying to boost the muscle sub.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.480]   They're 500 feet long.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   Pretty big.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   How many men?
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   120 in 500 feet.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.040]   That's like 3.7 feet per person.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.360]   A lot of people get claustrophobia.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   You have to be tested.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.920]   You have to be checked out to be a sub guy.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   Did you pass the exam?
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   Had to pass on the stuff.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.360]   I mean, like, I had to pass all the stuff.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.920]   Have you ever seen a guy naked in a locker room?
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   They ask you stuff like that.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   No.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   What do they ask you?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920]   They ask you stuff like that.

[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   That sounds like David's book.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   Give me my laptop.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   I love Apple.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   Actually, there's no story here.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   This is a hit piece on John C.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   to work.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   What did you do to get this guy's cheese?
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   I think he just has a garage because I corrected him.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   Years ago.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   But that's okay.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   It's publicity.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   And I got two more plugs in for that column.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   Those old columns.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   Guy who actually-
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   You just doubled your plugs.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   Right.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   The guy who wrote the-
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   Double my plugs.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   The Apple clickbait generator.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   The Apple clickbait generator is Kirk Lennon.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   And he was influenced by the Macelope, who's been on this show several times.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   Most of the sentences are clicked or called verbatim from real clickbait articles.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   Some sentences I adapted.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   So if you want to try this out at home, you can go to the clickbait generator on Kirk
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   to let it out.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920]   It might come in handy.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   Although I think I can do better clickbait naturally.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   It is the case that-
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   It need a computer to help me.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   The best clickbait is human crafted.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   Yes.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   Handcrafted clickbait.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   Handcrafted.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Crafted by professionals.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.920]   We played before the show began yesterday's daily show segment on clickbait.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.920]   Did you see that?
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   Did my name come up in the conversation?
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   Oh man.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   It was kind of sad.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   The correspondent took a-
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   Was it Lansing, Michigan?
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   The last newspaper in Lansing, Michigan, which happens to be the student run newspaper.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   The old journalism students, he went to them and said, "So what makes news?"
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   And they said, "Well, you know, it's got to be useful.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   It's got- He said, "No, you're all wrong."
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   And he then went to a former editor at Gawker and got little help in helping them make their articles more juicy.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   Punchy.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   Punchy.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   If you want to learn how to do punchy stuff, go to the bottom of almost their new webpage
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   nowadays.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   And there's all this crap.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   What's the name of the company doing?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   I'm trying to smooth the cranes.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   It was crazy.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   Outbrain to boot.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   Outbrain.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   So, I'm going to go to the bottom.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   You've got these great headlines.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   They've got a picture of some hottie or something.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   They go, "Oh, I don't know if I should see the best stuff in the world.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   I'll take it out and check it out."
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   I don't.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   I don't.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   I resist those.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   I don't care who's got the best butt in the world because they never show it anyway.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   Shouldn't every headline be bait though?
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   I mean, it is bait.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   That's what a headline is.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   It's what a-
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   Traditionally is.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   Like a really well-written headline.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   Well, you said it.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.920]   It is like a New York Post's famous headlines in the New York Post because there was a tablet
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   and you're walking by and you-
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   But the thing I use does those things too.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   They all do.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   No, you're right.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   There's two schools of thought there.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.480]   There's a bunch of tech blogs that go sort of information heavy on their headlines so
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.920]   that they're very tweetable and in many cases-
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920]   They're very SEO-able.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   Right.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   Very SEO-able.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   There's a Twitter account saved you a click.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   Yes.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.200]   That's got like 130,000 followers.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.440]   It basically takes all these click bait headlines and answers it for you without putting the
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   link.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   That's funny.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.840]   So retweet AOL countries top paid singer isn't Taylor Swift.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.440]   It's dot dot dot and then save you a click rights Toby Keith.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.520]   Same J. Click.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   This actually is a funny, although I just read an article saying this isn't so nice
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.920]   for various reasons.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.720]   Buzzfeed wrote the article of course because they don't want to save you.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   Yeah, they were arguing.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   That's it.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   You're spoiling our surprises.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:39.560]   Anyway, I feel like this there is something to be said about the fact that the design-
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.240]   I agree with you Lindsay, the headlines are about driving traffic but there is a point
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.960]   where it goes so far that really it's all about driving the traffic.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   Right.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   No, it should be good.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   It should be solid.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   It should be a well-crafted, in-between.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.280]   Should be a truthful, accurate, accurate and heady maybe.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.560]   But it really should make you want to read the article.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   Right.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   That's fine.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   That's exactly correct.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   That's a great thing.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   It's a great thing.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   I don't want to get this into just a bitch fest about how bad web journalism is, but
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   it seems to pollute the waters a little bit.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   It pollutes the waters.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   Let's talk about this.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   There's no journalism left.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   Let's talk about this amazing physics-decide defying rocket engine.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   Oh, dear.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   Well, I'm glad I have smart people here because everybody, every tech blog without exception,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   including Wired, which is normally very smart, kind of jumped on this because of the word
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   "N-A-S-A" because NASA was in it, right?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.320]   The idea was that this had originally been created in 2001 by a guy who, I don't know,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.560]   was a little bit like, "Use water to power your car."
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   That's not good.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.320]   That's not a guy who, in fact, raised something like 45,000 pounds for the British government
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.080]   to devise a device.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.280]   It was essentially, especially designed tin can.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.840]   If you feed thousands of watts of microwave power into it and they bounce around in the
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:59.760]   can, somehow, miraculously, the can propels itself a small amount of power.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   It comes out of the can.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.960]   It's kind of a miracle because it defies the conservation of momentum.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.040]   John Bey has actually a really good post on this.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.280]   He's an actual quantum physicist on Google+, in which he says, "It's kind of like having
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.600]   the driver in the car push the wheel and making the car go forward."
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   We know.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.360]   It's not possible.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.200]   He believes that this is completely bogus and even that the NASA experiment, and that
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.640]   gives it some credibility, is bogus.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.200]   The amount of power it's creating is so small that it could easily simply be a measurement
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   error.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.240]   It doesn't take a lot to move something in space.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   No, no, but…
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   Even if it's…
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   It's not that.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.240]   It's not that.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.280]   If it were possible, it would be useful.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.600]   It's not possible.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.920]   It's a violation of classic physics that just doesn't work.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:07.440]   I would advise people to go to the YouTube and ask for anti-gravity devices.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.720]   What are some of these great videos that these kids have put together?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.160]   My favorite one is the reason why the phone drops the phone in there and the thing starts
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.800]   flying around and it's clearly got some piano wire on there or something.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   All right.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.120]   Lisa's son is 11 and watches a lot of YouTube told me yesterday, "Oh, you know they've
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   invented hoverboards."
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   That's an old one.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   Oh, I saw.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120]   I hover.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   That's an old one.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   And I said, "No, I'm sorry, Michael.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   They don't actually…
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   That's not possible.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   They don't have hoverboards."
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   But it was Doc Brown.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   He says…
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   No, it wasn't from Doc Brown.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   There's a YouTube video.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   A company made fake…
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   You saw it.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.120]   The fake hoverboard thing where they pained out in the re-stones.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   Very well done.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   Well done.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   I'm glad it's holding up the hoverboard.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.080]   But people believe this stuff.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.040]   Really, what it is is an argument for critical thinking or better critical thinking.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Well, it's a fail.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:01.400]   So, Baez, who is an actual quantum scientist, says that the NASA scientists say test results
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.000]   indicate that the RF resident cavity thruster design, which is unique as an electric propulsion
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.720]   device, is producing a force that's not attributable to any classical electromagnetic
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.800]   phenomenon, is therefore potentially demonstrating an interaction with a quantum vacuum virtual
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   plasma.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.000]   And everybody picked up that line.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.280]   It must be the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.040]   Baez says, "That's bullshit."
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   If you'll forgive.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   But he says…
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.640]   But it's grad school bullshit.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.920]   He says, "Quantum vacuum virtual plasma is something you'd say if you failed a course
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.520]   in quantum field theory and then smoked too much weed.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   There is no…
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.720]   There is no such thing as virtual plasma.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.160]   If you want to report experimental results, it seems to violate the known laws of physics
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.200]   fine, but it doesn't help your credibility to make up goofy pseudo explanations."
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:57.520]   In any event, this is another example of maybe these guys don't have the scientific knowledge
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.960]   to write the article and so they're just kind of, "Well, it's NASA.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   It must be true."
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   But I just…
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.280]   This story made the rounds too completely uncritically.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   Everybody believes it.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.280]   It's not true.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   I don't think it's true.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   I think it's just Baez.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.600]   There's a sucker born every minute.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   Yup.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   Okay.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   That's an issue.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   That was the end of that.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   That really killed the conversation.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   Well, wait.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   Nobody knows where to tell you.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   It's not true.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   It's not true.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   It's not true.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   It's not true.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.560]   And I don't think people called 911 to complain Facebook was down.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.600]   I think they did.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   You think they did?
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.360]   Because they call about the dumbest stuff.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.640]   See, we all believe people are dumb.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.960]   No.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Some people are dumb.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   There's not people.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.880]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   Okay.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.240]   It's about smart crowd.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.080]   And they aren't fooled by that stuff.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.560]   Actually, we should do a poll.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   I'm asleep.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   Do you think somebody actually called the LA Sheriff's Department to complain that Facebook was
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   down?
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   Is that incredible?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   I think that might be possible.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   Jamerby everybody.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   Of course that happened.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   Because we all know somebody would do that.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   All right.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.640]   Facebook's down.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.520]   The sheriff also said people said what the…
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   My power is out.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   Well, that's a reason.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   Why call 911?
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.600]   You know, it's a P.G. and A, but…
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   911's like emergency.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   There's an emergency.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   Facebook is down.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.240]   Emergency, emergency.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.760]   Maybe somebody wasn't getting enough likes and it was an emergency to them.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   Facebook should be banned.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.920]   Do you like my new phone, by the way?
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.400]   Have you played with that at all?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   You know.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   I don't know.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   It's okay.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   350 bucks for 64 gigabytes.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   You're kept saying that.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   Did you guys review the OnePlus one?
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   We have looked at it, yes.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.400]   The problem is you can't buy it.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.600]   Well, then what good is it?
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   Well, you can't even forget it.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   You have to get an invite.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   Well, that's what's weird about it.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.840]   I feel like there's something we don't know.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.360]   There's something missing here in this story.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.720]   Why would a company make a phone sell it for such a low price?
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.560]   It's a flagship killer, they call it.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   And it's true.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.320]   It has in every respect, top of line specs.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.600]   And a half the price of every other flagship phone.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   Okay.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.160]   But you have to get an invite or play a contest to get it.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.480]   You have to do a contest.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.320]   I think that's savvy marketing.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.640]   Well, it is.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.680]   If at some point you sell a lot of phones, they're still--
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.440]   Well, don't you think the price alone would be shiny marketing?
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   It's a shiny market.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   And they're still trying to like--
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   So you think at some point--
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.120]   The dam will open and they'll sell.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.840]   The back come off, they're kind of basically copying the Xiaomi model, but for--
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   The Western market.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   This is like the Xiaomi, the big Xiaomi.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   It's a very nice phone.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   It's very pretty.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   It's a very smart, very similar model.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   Don't take the fact.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   I could take the fact.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.040]   It's like John's ripping the phone off.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   It does.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.360]   It comes off, but it doesn't give you access to anything.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.640]   You can only replace it with a different color back.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   But it feels exclusive.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   That's come off.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   You just said so.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   Okay, let's take it off.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   It feels super expensive.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   You feel the sound of me, but Ryan actually ordered one.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   How do you get it off?
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   And reviewed it.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   Jason Howell of all about Android.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   Love the show.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   It feels exclusive.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   Well, it's like Gmail.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   I mean, when Gmail was in beta, people were selling their Gmail invites on eBay because--
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   I'm going to get the back off.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   Exactly.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   It's sort of like--
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   It's beautiful fun back before you--
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   A few reviewers have given it a very positive review.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   I think it's excellent.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   It's an excellent phone.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   And then it's not really available.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   So people that will up excitement around it.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   And then when it does become available to lots of people, they'll get it.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   Did you see a needless free publicity?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   This phone should not even be on the show.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   Did you have seen it?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   Well, did you debate?
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   It's seen it.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   Should we review this phone if it's not widely available?
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   No, we actually didn't debate it.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   We're eager to do it because it is not widely available.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   Right.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   And although it is available--
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   Makes a little sense.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   Right?
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   So somebody has to make a decision if they're going to spend some money on it.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   Yeah, my decision would be to stiff them.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   But also, it's just interesting.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   Right?
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   All of these startups out of China are interesting.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   There's no--
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   CDMA?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   There's a SIM card.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   Is it a CDMA?
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   There's a SIM card slot right here.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   Let's see.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   Pull it out.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   I don't have a--
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   What do you mean pull out my SIM card?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   I want to see it.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   Why would I pull out my SIM card?
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   I want to see if there's a SIM card in there.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   It looks just like a SIM card.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   I put it in so I know it's there.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   Trust me.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   You know for a fact that you can put one in.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   Yeah, because I put one in.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   And you can take it out.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640]   It's got my phone number.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   It's an AT&T SIM.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   You can put a T-Mobile SIM in it as well.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   Okay.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   So it's GSM?
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   It's GSM, that's right.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   Can I see it again?
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   All right, guys.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   I have a feeling something bad is going to happen.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   No, no.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   While I let John fiddle with my phone, let's talk about Jira.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   You know, the original name for Godzilla in Japanese is Go Jira.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   I think Atlassian knew that.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   Jira is one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   and project management systems used by big companies.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   NASA uses it as Chad has told us before.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   Mojang uses it for Minecraft.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   In fact, if you ever file a Minecraft bug report, you're filing it through Jira.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   It captures and organizes your workflow so you can prioritize it, take action on what's
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   important while staying up to date with the activity going around with you.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.640]   It's simple enough for a small team.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.640]   It's powerful enough for a hundred thousand person enterprise.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   That's why 25,000 companies use Jira.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   70% of the Fortune 100.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   NASA uses Jira.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   Jira is incredibly flexible and extendable.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   Of course, there are literally hundreds of add-ons for Jira.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   Test management, time tracking, project management.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   If you're using, you know, if your issues involve code, they tie everything together
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   from an initial planning doc, the files, the change sets in your code repository
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   right through the deployment.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   Get, of course, completely integrated.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   They've got REST API.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   So if it doesn't, you know, if there's not a module for what you want to do
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   to a plugin, you can easily build yourself, build one.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   Flexible and simple, it is amazing.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   And I want you to try it right now for 3D days free.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   Go to Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com/twit.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   For more information, you've heard of Jira.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   I'm sure you have.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   If you're on a team, if you're a programmer, if you, you know, you've shipped products,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   you've heard of Jira.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Now you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Monthly plans start at $10 a month or up to 10 users, so it's very affordable.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   Atlassian.com/twit.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   Consider it Jira.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   This is a story that bothered me in some ways, and I don't know what, again, what I do every
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   week is I put together stories that bother me and I give you, and I come to you and I say,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   explain to me.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   A Houston man is being charged for child pornography in his email.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   The police say they know about it because Google tipped them off.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   Now, I am not in favor of child pornography.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.640]   I'm glad they got the guy if that's what he was doing, but is it at all troubling the
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   Google, apparently, according to the police who told this to KHAU TV in Houston, Google
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   spotted three allegedly pornographic images of children in his Gmail and tipped off the
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   National Center for Missing and Exploding Kids.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   I wonder how that worked.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   Yeah, see that Google, scan your video.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   Chris Matish, Matistic.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   Matistic.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   Doesn't look like Matistic to me.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   Matistic.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   Okay.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   I'll take your word for it.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   People never get that guy's reading, right?
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   No, I think he likes it.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   I've been saying it wrong for 20 years.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   I'm pretty sure he understands that.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   It's not a TYSZ, CZYK, Matistic.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   I'd change it wrong.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   You speak Polish, obviously.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   Obviously.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   Or Czech or whatever this is.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   Whatever it is.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   Anyway, Chris contacted Google.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   They have not responded.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   He also asked whether it's part of their standard operating policy.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   Of course it is.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   Well, it's clear that it's not a coincidence.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   This is what bothers me.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   We know Google scans your email.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   But mechanically, looking for keywords, maybe kicks them out once you're wrong.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   That sounds like a shield I might have looked at.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   No, it could be done mechanically too.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   They have facial and skin recognition for images.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   Probably the same way Facebook alerts when there's a entity.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   Okay.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   Are you telling me Gmail scanning my email for nudity?
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   So they're probably stopping a lot with your stuff.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   Because you couldn't.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   You wouldn't on the face of it know that it's a kid.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.600]   Unless they have some magic scanner that says that's a nude kid.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   No, they probably, I think they kick it out.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   Because there's no need to kick it out.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   And then the people look at it and go, "Oh, that's all good stuff."
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   Well, they have a backend, the Google image search engine, right?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   So maybe there's something that was in there that was flagged for child porn in the past.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   And then they just, this is a--
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   This is a--
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   This is a--
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   This is a--
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   This is a statement from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   See, this is not Google.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   That's right?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   No, this is from-- Yeah, that's center.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   It says since 2008, we've had a hashing technology--
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   Oh, yeah, it's a tag known theory.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   --to tag the theory.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   Child, sexual abuse images and identify them.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   So maybe they gave that to Google?
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   Well, there you go.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600]   I guess they give them a database--
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   Yeah, that could be.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   --troubles some images and Google's--
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   Oh, maybe they're known images.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   Okay, that would do it.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   And that's what the hashing would do.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   This is a known image that's circulated.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   And as soon as they get a child porn image, they create a hash and then they give it to Google.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   And Google's matching images.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   Well, Google does have image search.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   And it has safe search.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   I feel better.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   Google already has to understand--
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   I understand.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   I wouldn't feel that.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   --the skin search.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   I understand.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   Skin search.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   I know that if there's a certain percentage of flesh, if it sees like 40% flesh--
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   But the person's got a lot of tattoos.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   Would that be different?
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   But I'm just saying, I understand that, but that still would be troubling because you'd have to also--
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   Sure.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   --you'd have to actually look at it to know it's child pornography.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   So what you're saying is it was a specific-- it was a known image that they had a hash for.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   That would make sense.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   Google hasn't confirmed this is a known image.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   No, but--
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   But I think-- thank you, Chad.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   Was that business insider or anything like that?
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   All right.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   It makes a lot of sense that Google's looking at everything anyway.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   I think Google is looking at everything.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   But if Google put itself in a position to police the world that way, I think that you must be right.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   There's some sort of--
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   This makes-- this really relieves me.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   And it probably relieves me.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   I mean, I can't imagine that Google would sign itself up for that.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   I don't want any human at Google looking at my email.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   It's fine if a machine scans it.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   Google is going to have humans at some point looking at your email.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   Well, we know the NSA is looking at your email.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   Snowden revealed that they actually young NSA analysts passed around.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   Google's doing that.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   I know.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   You think Google's doing that?
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   Well, not routine.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   I mean, I think they've already-- I have a counter to that at some small level.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   Will you counter that?
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Because you're-- you probably involved in Homeland Security when you were in the Navy.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   Yeah?
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   My last three years in the Navy was for the NSA.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   There you go.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   Now we got some--
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   [laughter]
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   And now Leo, you're on some watch list.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   And I'll just--
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   I'll just-- I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   I'll just-- I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   I'll just-- I'll just-- I'll just--

[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   I'll just-- I'll just--
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   I'll just-- I'll just-- I'll just--

[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.600]   Mr. International--
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   Yeah, we've been covering this.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.600]   Qualcomm is under the same pressures right now in China.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600]   China also appears to be tilting their smartphone market
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.600]   in favor of local companies, so Lenovo and Xiaomi are benefiting from--
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600]   What a surprise.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.600]   Some moves that are hurting Apple and Samsung.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.600]   For example, the carriers--
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   the Chinese government told the carriers to stop subsidizing so much of the phone's cost,
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   so that would essentially make--
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.600]   you know, here you go to the Verizon store, you get an iPhone for $200,
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.600]   but it actually costs $650 to the carrier.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   They subsidize the cost.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   It's a lower to the price for you.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.600]   China's telling their state-owned cellular carriers not to do so much of that.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   So--
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.600]   Just so you have to pay too much for the phone and--
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.600]   So the iPhone becomes $700.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.600]   Do you feel though that Microsoft has become a target of late?
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:28.600]   Because last week, China government said you cannot buy Windows 8 for government work
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.600]   because we believed Microsoft or the NSA through Microsoft is spying on us.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.600]   That seems targeted.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   It seems like Microsoft's aiming-- Microsoft's a target of China.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600]   What would your thoughts be?
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.600]   Microsoft has long been a target of--
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.600]   I mean, some of the Chinese government visions were paying for--
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.600]   Yeah, the primary--
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   Like Word and Windows, which has been a problem for a long time
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600]   and on Microsoft's last earnings call, they said,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.600]   China's still a trouble spot and we don't see it improving anytime soon.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   But hasn't China been targeting Apple too?
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.600]   I mean, similar kinds of conversations, right?
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   Sort of like you were saying, it doesn't--
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.600]   If you're a large company and you're in China, China's got its eye on you.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:11.600]   Yeah, China's-- I mean, the geopolitical tensions right now at the US are pretty bad,
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.600]   so a lot of the American tech companies are getting punished,
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   just like, you know, Walmart and everybody else is having trouble over there.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   Is it, though, that they really fear they're being spied on,
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   or is that just a lever in some sort of deeper negotiation that's going on?
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.600]   What is it that China wants?
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.600]   Well, part of it has to do with the fact that our government is blocking out
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   a lot of Chinese companies from getting deals.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   CTE and Lenovo trying to sell networking equipment to sell carriers to Congress.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.600]   Congress, a congressional report said businesses shouldn't buy ZTE or Huawei.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   For fear of spying.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   Because of Chinese government spying.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   And so this could, you know--
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600]   It's just a tip to--
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.600]   It's just a tip to--
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Payback.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.600]   What do you think, Mr. NSA analysts?
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   Well, we have had routers come from overseas with, like, spying firmware.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.600]   Yeah, and we're not doing the same thing apparently, right?
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.600]   Because according to those Snowden documents, we're pretty good at putting that kind of stuff around us.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.600]   I think we're probably better.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.600]   Who's better at subverting routers? That's the question.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.600]   I haven't heard of, like, us going that far.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600]   That's how good we are.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.600]   That's how good we are.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.600]   Yeah, if it was actually happening then.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   Actually, you know, Deadcon and Blackheads coming up this week.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   It's true.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600]   You're going?
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600]   No, but--
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.600]   Why?
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.600]   I've never been.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600]   Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   You'd enjoy it because everyone would know you and they would come up with you.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.600]   And hack me.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   Oh, you would totally get a target.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   They'd probably hack your phone and hack that--
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.600]   There's a lot of sexy texts on my phone.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   You just wait for it to show up on the Wall of Shame.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.600]   Wall of sheep, I think it could go.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600]   They would be there in five minutes, probably.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.600]   Oh, my God.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.600]   They might be able to get dead.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   Father Robert Ballister said they wouldn't hack a priest, would they?
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   Yes, of course they would.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   First thing.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   That'd be first target.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.600]   Right away.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.600]   Especially Hack a priest.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.600]   Opus dei.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   No, he's going to be down there.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.600]   He's going to cover it for us.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600]   He goes every year.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]   He loves Blackhead and Def--
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   He doesn't just go to Defcon, which is kind of the people's conference.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.600]   Blackheads, the one where they're--
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]   That's the learning.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.600]   The one where the fans go to and the big shots go.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.600]   That's where you're going.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.600]   You learn how to do stuff.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.600]   So we expect there'll be a lot of announcements in the next couple of weeks over security.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.600]   One already kind of leaked out.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.600]   We don't know the details, but the exploit is called Bad USB.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   I like this one.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   And I want to get-- somebody's got to know the technology behind this, and I want to know what it is.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   So get ready, Alan Melvantano.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.600]   Oh, dear.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.600]   You are teed up.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   How can this work?
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600]   And is it a widespread problem?
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.600]   I know that Steve Gibson will be talking about this on Instagram.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   This is a different layer than--
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600]   This is not an auto-run.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.600]   It's a hardware layer.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.600]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.600]   We're not talking about an auto-run.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600]   Right.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   This is not an auto-run.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   That is actually much more nefarious.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.600]   Before we do that, though, I do want to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.600]   John, do you have a Squarespace site for Devorg?
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.600]   You should--
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   No agenda show.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.600]   No agenda show.com is Squarespace.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.600]   And they don't even pay you to do that, do they?
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600]   They don't.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]   You do it because you love it.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.600]   Is that my phone?
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   Yes.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600]   You started music?
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600]   I didn't do anything.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600]   This is what you listen to?
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600]   That's good stuff.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.600]   And now we have an erosion.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600]   That sounds like Bush.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.600]   It is.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   This is the George Bush rap.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.600]   Doody.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.600]   Everybody.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.600]   Doody.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.600]   Doody.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600]   Doody.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.600]   Is that your ringtone?
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   Doody.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600]   Doody.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   I've never heard it before, Mr. Anisea.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.600]   You're going to have to pay royalties.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.600]   You're not having any second now.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.600]   No, I don't think it's--
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.600]   No, I don't think it's a real song.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.600]   Did you just start that?
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.600]   I didn't do anything.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.600]   It's still locked.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600]   How did you get that to play?
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.600]   I don't know.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   Doody, doody, doody.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.600]   No, somebody hacked the phone.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   Nobody have an NSA guy.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.600]   Sorry.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   Sorry.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600]   Doody, doody.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600]   The only guy on a Windows box, that's why it happened.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.600]   I can't stop it.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.600]   I can't stop it.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   We've got George Bush rapping on the show and we can't stop him here.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   Just get--
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   Here, you turn it off.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.600]   That is weird.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.600]   Doody.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.600]   Why is he saying "Duty"?
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   Doody, I don't know.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.600]   It's not--
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   It's kind of a catchy tune.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.600]   Sometimes it's horrible.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   Whether it's suffering, there is duty.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.600]   I can attest to that.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.600]   We just have to doody in our time.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.600]   What's key?
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.600]   It's Jonathan Colton.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   There you go, your buddy.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   My buddy.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.600]   He's probably cold.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.600]   That's probably his ringtone.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600]   This is ringtone.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   No, it isn't.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   I don't know why it rang and I'm going to keep the phone over here.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]   Now I'm--
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   Holy cow, John C.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.600]   So you like Squarespace because, you know, no agenda.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   Hugely popular show.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   It is.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   Hugely popular show.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   The kids love it.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600]   They do.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   Many 11--
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   We have it.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.600]   Don't watch TV.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   They watch this in the agenda.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.600]   We have a wide demo.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.600]   Very wide.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.600]   There you go.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:45.600]   There you go.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.600]   You can't really--
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.600]   Which is amazing because it's an audio program.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.600]   Yes.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.600]   But he takes most of the gens and he can see it.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.600]   It's amazing.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   Yes.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.600]   It's--
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.600]   No, he doesn't do that.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:55.600]   He's a good boy.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   But however--
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.600]   We have a lot of commuters that listen to the show because as long as three--
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   Six hours a week.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.600]   And that's one show.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   Well, it could be, but no.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.600]   Twice weekly.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   Yes, but now on Thursdays.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   So this site, you want to cite the people when they're-- when you're doing the show, people
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.600]   can rush to that site, flood it.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.600]   Hundreds and thousands of people can visit it.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.600]   And the last thing you'd want is that it goes down.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.600]   It can't.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.600]   Because--
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.600]   It's Squarespace.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.600]   You think we're making this up.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.600]   But no, this is true.
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   Squarespace.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.600]   We have tried--
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.600]   Take a piece of the action on these--
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600]   Everybody go just know--
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   Right now, knownagendocio.com.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.600]   Everybody go there in the listening audience and the viewing audience.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.600]   Everybody go there.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.600]   And I guarantee you, I can bring any site down except a Squarespace site.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.600]   I cannot bring it down.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.600]   And we've tried.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.600]   And that's because Squarespace really is committed to not only great uptime, but great response
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.600]   time.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.600]   So Squarespace pages pop up.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.600]   That's because the hosting at Squarespace is tightly integrated with the software.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.600]   They do stuff behind the scenes.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600]   They explain it to me once.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   It went over my head.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.600]   But it's very sophisticated involving virtual servers and Java.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   It's amazing.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   You don't need to know.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.600]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   All Squarespace templates are modern mobile responsive design.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.600]   You get the benefit of the latest, greatest state-of-the-art web technologies.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.600]   But you don't have to be an HTML or JavaScript or CSS guru.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:19.600]   You could just point and click your way to a beautiful website that matches your aesthetic,
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.600]   your sensibilities, whether you're a photographer, an artist, whether you're selling online
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.600]   or whether you're a sublogger, you just want a great site.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.600]   Visit squarespace.com.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   Now you can take a look at Squarespace.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.600]   Even try it for two weeks.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600]   Use all the features absolutely free.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   All you have to do is name a site, give them an email address and a password and you're
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   in.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   You can import all the content from your existing site, change the templates at will.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   They do have a developer's platform.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   If you're a JavaScript guru, you can do anything with Squarespace.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600]   But you don't have to be.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600]   And that's beautiful.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.600]   Their newly redesigned customer help site will help you there, by the way.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   Look, there's George Bush.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.600]   That is a weird coinkeating.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   That's not George Bush.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.600]   That went in the blue.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   Over there.
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.600]   It's Katy Perry, George Bush.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.600]   What do Katy Perry and George Bush have in common?
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.600]   Answer?
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.600]   Duty.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.600]   Duty.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.600]   [laughter]
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   We're dead.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600]   He's rated the whole show to get one in.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   That's the name of the show right there.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600]   Nailed it too.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.600]   Home run.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.600]   Home run.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.600]   Coming in.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.600]   Thank you, man.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.600]   The bottom of the night.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.600]   So it starts at $8 a month.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   They're new.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.600]   Oh, I was telling you about the new help site.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.600]   They've got a self-help articles, video workshops, webinars.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:34.600]   So you can get really good at this if you want to spend the time.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.360]   $8 a month, a basic plan.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.600]   That includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600]   They have mobile apps that are beautiful.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:47.680]   In fact, if you're a photographer, they have a portfolio app that will pull the photos from
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:54.240]   your website and display them on an iPad or an iPhone for your client.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.680]   This is really actually pretty awesome.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.800]   I could just go on and on.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.880]   Why don't you go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button, try it.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.840]   All I ask is when you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIT because you're going to get
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.640]   10% off and that way they'll know you heard about it on this week in tech.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.320]   And if they had a code for Noah Jenna's show, I would give it to you.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.240]   But they don't.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.240]   Why don't you?
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.240]   Oh, you don't do ads.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.240]   We don't do ads.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.400]   But this is their pure.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400]   As the driven snow.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.760]   As the driven snow.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.640]   Squarespace.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.400]   So, we will find out more.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:36.960]   I think it's a black hat that they're going to give a presentation on bad USB.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.320]   You want the 30 second version?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.320]   The 30, yeah.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.040]   This comes from security research labs in Berlin.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.520]   So if you could do it with a German accent, I'd appreciate it.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.040]   I do not have, especially your German accent.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.040]   You can.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.240]   OK, I will channel and Carsten Noel, chief scientist.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240]   Yes.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:57.840]   If you put anything into your USB slot, you'll convince Robert.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.560]   So what exactly is happening?
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.720]   So like any device that you have in your possession, like connected to your computer
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.640]   directly, you can update the firmware.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.640]   Right.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.960]   Now, see, this is interesting.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.280]   A thumb drive has firm, but not just firmware, programmable firmware.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280]   Sure.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   This was my question.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.280]   It's just wrong.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280]   Why is it programming?
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280]   Why isn't that?
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   So I would, I'd ask the same exact question.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.280]   Why is that locked?
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.520]   That makes no sense to me that would be programming.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.440]   It's locked down by obscurity, historically.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440]   Right.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.320]   Because usually you plug a USB drive in.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.040]   You'd need to know how well that works.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.200]   Well, you would need some kind of special tool to be able to rewrite that firmware,
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.600]   just like any other firmware programming software.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.120]   So if you have access to that firmware, you can write other code.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.640]   You can make it appear as other devices.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.160]   You can make it appear as a keyboard.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.040]   You just can't do it through the regular USB port.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.600]   It has to have like an EEPROM, something you need, something like electronic.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600]   Well, and that's what's interesting.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.320]   It's a specific controller that is created by a company called Pfizen, which does in
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.080]   fact have EEPROM on it.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.080]   Right.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.080]   Electronically erasable programmable original memory.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.080]   Right.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.080]   And you can't just do by plugging in the USB port.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080]   No, you have to have a name.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.080]   You need hardware.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.080]   You need a programmer.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.720]   I think it's light that erases it and then you have to have it.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.720]   No, not those.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   Not EEPROMs.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.720]   It's electronically erasable.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.720]   It's done through the port.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.880]   You just have like if you, if the device could be reprogrammed that way.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.520]   Does it make that noise?
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.520]   It is.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:26.160]   I don't know if this is, if it's the case with this, but it would be theoretically possible
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.680]   to make a, to code a firmware, you know, reprogram.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.760]   That you would put on the hard drive of the company.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.520]   That you could have running on the host operating system and could then reprogram.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.520]   I don't know if this is, if it's a case with this one.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.920]   So that's what some of the things we're going to learn at the Black Hat presentation.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.080]   But I think part of the question is, okay, obviously this has always been the case.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:49.280]   This is, that would be nothing new that a manufacturer of a thumb drive could put malware
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280]   on a thumb drive.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   They could.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   That's actually been done.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280]   Of course.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.880]   Anybody who's making hardware can put malware on their hardware.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.240]   And we've seen that happen.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.720]   And we've seen it by accident even where there's been.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.720]   The theory was that that's how Stuxnet made its way into the Iranian nuclear facility.
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.720]   It was on the website.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.720]   That's the ticket.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   It was an accident.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.520]   No, I think Stuxnet was.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.520]   I think everybody.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   No, there was a state.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.520]   Generally there was a state.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.720]   It was government written, probably Israeli and US government.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   But the facility was on the grid.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   So they had to get it in the room.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720]   So they had to get it in the room.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720]   So they had to get it in the room.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.720]   I'm not saying he did.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.720]   I'm not saying he did.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.720]   I was the guy defending against it.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.520]   He knew how to reverse engineer that malware, that's for sure.
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.720]   But Stuxnet and Flame and these other very sophisticated malware attacks, I think most
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.600]   people agree, probably governmental.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.200]   And in this case, it was, I think this was actually a brilliant idea.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.600]   Iran was enriching uranium to make atomic bombs.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.000]   Stuxnet attacked the centrifuges and brought them down.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.700]   And the theory being if we can break the centrifuges and have them over spin, this could
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:00.000]   cripple their ability to enrich the uranium.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.680]   That sounds like the kind of warfare I like.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680]   That's good.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.680]   Right?
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.680]   Nobody gets hurt.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]   That's the future of warfare.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.280]   Well, according to the American government, an act of war.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   It's like, oh yeah.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.680]   If it is to us, we're going to get you, sucker.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.760]   But we can do it to them.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.600]   You know everybody's going to do it to everybody, right?
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.360]   We have the same kinds of rules though.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.360]   You guys know that, right?
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.720]   What are the rules on this stuff?
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.280]   Well, I can't quote them directly, but like we have those kinds of rules.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.600]   Like we're not allowed to just go and invade other countries.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.400]   No, no, you give it to the CIA.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.200]   NSA is not allowed to.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.200]   You give it to the CIA.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.200]   They do it.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   What?
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.200]   You've heard of them.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.120]   No, I mean, of course, that's how it's all done.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.600]   It's compartmentalized.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.000]   You're just the lowly analyst, reverse engineering the malware.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   Oh, sure.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.120]   You hand that off to somebody else who then takes it and weaponizes it, who then hands
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.000]   it off to somebody else who gets into Iran who then's in.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   So it's all compartmentalized.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.200]   Nobody knows who's doing it, but they all have to still follow the rules.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:54.200]   But they're all on the rules.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.600]   If it's an act of war.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.920]   Pretty cynical, it seems to me, Leo.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.920]   Me?
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   Yes.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.840]   Okay, who put the USB stick in the centrifuge?
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.160]   Well, let's get back to this USB stick for the game.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.560]   It was a him.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.120]   It was you, Leo.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.120]   I would have done it.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   That's a great act.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.960]   First, you know about the orange cables.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.120]   Yeah, now you know about the centrifuge.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   Now you know about the centrifuge.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.240]   So why have some unexplained travel in that timeframe, but I was just going to.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.120]   Let's get back to this USB story.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.600]   So what are we going to do about these things?
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600]   Nothing.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600]   You screwed.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   Game over, man.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]   Game over.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   What?
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   Well, that's what we're going to find out.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.320]   I mean, we haven't really seen the details because he's going to present it.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.880]   They're going to show it.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.160]   But it sounds as if a significant number of USB sticks have reprogrammable firmware.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.800]   That's bad.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:51.160]   The answer would be to only buy USB sticks that had ROM if such a thing exists.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.960]   Yeah, I have a feeling that a lot of them are reprogrammable.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.960]   Why is that?
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.800]   Well, I mean, what's funny is the first thing that comes to mind for me is that the what
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.600]   you would think is the most secure is probably the most reprogrammable.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   That's iron key.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   What?
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   Like iron key.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:11.000]   That's supposed to be like they release firmwares.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]   Well, no, they release firmwares.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.320]   Now, I don't know what the level of like if they're doing some kind of check or something
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.480]   as soon as you see that you can firmware update your USB key.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480]   That's bad.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.480]   This is what's scary.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.920]   I'm reading of your shoulder, but the quote from this art story.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.760]   There's no way to get the firmware without the help of the firmware.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.120]   And if you ask the infected firmware, it will just lie to you.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.120]   Yeah, there's no virus.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.000]   I like the lying firmware.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   That lying firmware.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   Are you hacked?
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   No.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   No, I'm not hacked.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   I'm good.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.240]   That's actually that's very similar.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.240]   There are rules.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.920]   No, no.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.800]   That's along the lines of how people used to hack direct TV.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.840]   Direct TV would try to figure out if you had hacked your card and you signaled that.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.520]   You would reprogram your card in such a way that it reported back to the box.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.520]   Oh, no, I'm not hacked.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.520]   Those were the good old days.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.520]   Remember that they'd send a code down.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.880]   They'd send you to reprogram your card.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.720]   Was that a cat and a mascot?
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.720]   Yes.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   And then they toast the card.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.720]   Yeah, they fried it.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.720]   Yeah, there's all of her.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.720]   I remember I had direct TV.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.240]   I think it was direct TV.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.920]   And they had, they were going to go to new cards.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:14.920]   So they sent you another card and they said, "You got to put this card in within the next
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:15.920]   week."
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:16.920]   Yep.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.960]   But before you do type in something, you have to send something to it.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.840]   And then it would toast the card that was in there.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.080]   You got this burnt card out.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.680]   Yeah, because they don't want you passing that along.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.760]   I should have taken that card out before I else fell for that game.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760]   It would have just...
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.680]   Here's what they say they're going to do at Black Hat next week.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.640]   They're going to take a brand name, USB stick, and they're going to transform it into a computer
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   keyboard.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:44.280]   So you plug in the stick, it opens a command window in the computer, and enters command
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.760]   that causes it to download and install malicious software malware.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.760]   Yep.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.480]   So you plug it in, all of a sudden a command line opens up.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.480]   Boom.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.560]   That will be in a round user access control.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.560]   It's using your credentials.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.920]   And when you plug it in, so that's why you should be a limited user, then they will transform
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.240]   a brand name, USB stick, into a network card.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.640]   Once active, the network card causes the computer to use a domain name system server
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.000]   that is malicious.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.360]   So when you enter in Yahoo.com, you get bad Yahoo.com.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.720]   That's a well-known malware attack.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.440]   Easy to do.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.080]   Then they'll program a brand name, USB stick, to surreptitiously inject a payload into a
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.720]   legitimate Ubuntu installation file.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.480]   The file is loaded onto the drive when attached to one computer.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.640]   After the tampering only happens after it's plugged into a different computer that has
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.040]   no operating system on it.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.560]   So you could use a trusted computer, verify that this is no, the MD5 hash says that's
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.480]   a legitimate Ubuntu install.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480]   Right.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.800]   Unplug it because it's been verified and now install it, and in fact it's not.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.640]   Only the new install gets infected.
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.640]   That's really...
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:57.760]   Finally, there will transform an Android phone into a malicious network card.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:58.760]   Just for fun.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:04.080]   Just go back to writeable DVDs and let's give up on this stuff.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.600]   So this is really interesting.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.680]   We'll know more about it.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:08.680]   I don't know.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.760]   I'm sure Steve Gibson will talk about it after the Black Hat because I think you want
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.640]   to hear the presentation before you say anything.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:19.400]   Apparently, it says, according to Ars Technica, the vast...
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   Is this Dan Gooden?
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.560]   Yeah, Dan Gooden writing.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:27.320]   The vast majority of USB devices will accept any firmware update they're offered.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.480]   There's no check.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.480]   They are writeable.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.400]   You need the right tool though, that's the thing.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.400]   Right.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.960]   You have to have the right software or hardware.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.680]   That's some protection, right?
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.840]   Well, it's security through obscurity, which...
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.840]   Right.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.600]   Yeah, but let's find out what the tool is and buy a few copies.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.640]   My question is, is it a cheaper to use ROMs that are not programmable?
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.840]   Why don't they use non-programmable read-only memories?
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.840]   Why are they using erasable memories?
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.520]   In your halfway through production of this whole batch of things.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.520]   How do you stand?
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.520]   No, I think you're right.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:55.520]   I think you really have to do that.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.520]   It needs to be.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.720]   Because there's too many updates, upgrades, and the USB 2.0, 3.0, these things, they're
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:01.720]   in flux.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.720]   No, no, no, no.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720]   The whole upgrade's there, flash drive.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:04.720]   Nobody upgrades.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   Oh, they don't.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.720]   They don't.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.720]   They don't.
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   They don't.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   It's a pedal.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720]   They don't.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.720]   It's a pedal.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.720]   It says no until they get it perfected.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.720]   They manufacture, yeah.
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.720]   And then they're cranking them out.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.720]   I think it makes logical sense.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   Well, we're screwed.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   We're going to have to get back to CD-ROMs.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.400]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.280]   I use them.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.680]   Let's quickly see, we had a good week.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.680]   I want to cheer people up.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.920]   Well, I just see a little bit of the fun that you missed because you weren't here this
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:33.920]   week.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.920]   What?
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.920]   On Twitch.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.920]   It's called a "pre-usely" on Twitch.
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.920]   Go down!
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.920]   Tech news today.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.440]   The OKCUBE at online dating site, Ragged in a blog post yesterday that, quote, "We
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:47.920]   experiment on human beings."
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:53.160]   It's saying that it experiments on its users all the time by saying, hey, this isn't something
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.160]   that's actually rare.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:59.160]   If you're a person who's on the internet who uses websites, everyone is constantly trying
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:03.120]   to use its data to kind of run experiments on you.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.120]   All about Android.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.360]   What was supposed to be Samsung's first Ties in Smartphone has been delayed indefinitely
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.160]   according to reports with singles many to speculate whether Tiesin on a smartphone will
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.080]   in fact ever happen.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.080]   Ready it up.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:22.080]   The title of this is "Little Girl is Devastated that her baby brother must grow up."
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.080]   You're welcome!
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.080]   Before you buy.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.760]   That looks like a rear form.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:28.760]   It does.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.080]   It is the Papago Ghost Safe 260.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.800]   While you're looking at the mirror, it's looking at the world outside of it.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   That is true.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.800]   It is just saving it all.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.800]   It saves it all of the time.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.800]   Hey!
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.800]   Get that slurp each.
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   Marketing Mavericks.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:44.600]   How important is it though to sell individual songs?
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.000]   The first is this big release of a new album.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.680]   Most people buy singles, not albums, and we're aware of that.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.360]   And yet we wanted to make an album.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.360]   So there you go.
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360]   Twit.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.360]   Bring your brain.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.360]   We'll do the rest.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.360]   Here we go in the car wash to get rid of the slushy.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   Okay, good.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.680]   Well, it was important.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.920]   So again, program note Monday.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.520]   We will be talking to Kevin Rose on triangulation 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern Time 1800 UTC.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.160]   That'll be a good show tomorrow on Twit.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.320]   One last story, a super, super breakthrough.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.680]   This one I believe, Stanford is going to triple your battery life.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.680]   A lithium anode battery that might give electric vehicles 300 mile driving range, triple a
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.800]   cell phone's effective life.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:31.800]   Wouldn't this be good news?
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:32.960]   It would be huge news.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.400]   And I think it's going to make, if it's true, and I assume it is, and in assuming that the
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.960]   technology can be brought down to a small size pretty quickly, it's going to be really
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.880]   important for the entire wearable proposition.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.760]   Because one of the problems with wearables is that you have to recharge them every night
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.760]   or every couple of nights.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.120]   And that's just annoying when you talk about something that you want to wear on your body.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.760]   So I think it's huge.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.240]   Of course, USA Today not doing the deep research.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:06.960]   They found a 92 year old professor of material science at the University of Texas named Good
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.440]   Enough, who said, well, it might be expensive.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.440]   It's always expensive.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:13.440]   Not good enough.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.440]   He's not just anybody.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440]   He invented lithium on it.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.440]   Well, there you go.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.360]   And I didn't agree with the chat room here.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.160]   Another battery promise there are about two a week.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160]   These types of reports are a dime a dozen.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.480]   Remember super capacitors?
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480]   That was.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   Oh, that was going to be.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480]   Yeah, I still think these technologies exist.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.480]   They just have a vehicle to make them work.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.320]   Whoever's in the car with a super capacitor.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.320]   So it goes wrong.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.320]   Usually the big one.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   Just boom.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320]   As you say it is.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.320]   Super capacitors exist.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.480]   I have an electric drug, right?
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.480]   It's a screw drug.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:43.760]   Yeah, it'll charge in seconds, 30 seconds.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.360]   It's like amazing.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.360]   So it exists.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   And you know what, John?
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.360]   Guess what?
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.000]   A tank full of gas can explode and blow up the driver as well.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.480]   Anything with enough energy to power a two ton piece of metal at 60 miles an hour is going
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.480]   to have some fuel capacity.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.280]   Well, it wasn't lithium ion really expensive and a little bit crazy at first.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.280]   It was.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.280]   It was.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:07.440]   Where is this super capacitor commercially 50 year old drill?
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.160]   Well, my drill is not a bad thing to have it.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]   I don't know.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:16.480]   And how much how much electricity has to be stored in a super cap in a car to get the
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.480]   same.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:18.480]   You have a gasoline engine.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.920]   The promise of super capacitors is they charge almost, you know, right away very fast.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.880]   So they self discharge as the catch.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.000]   So if you're off to your car, there's another catch.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.080]   You can't just plug them into the wall and 120 volts and super charge.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.040]   You have to have quite a bit of a lot of voltage and average in there.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.000]   What a Watts to do that in 30 seconds.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.320]   You got to charge it a certain way.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.560]   Anyway, I hope we have better batteries.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.080]   Don't you?
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.080]   It'll happen.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.080]   Really?
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.080]   It has to.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.680]   It's got a lot of people thinking about it.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:50.440]   Like 10 years from now, you think all of us are just going to be only on the same old
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.960]   with the end model with this because somebody called me on the radio show today and said,
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.720]   I'm the next 15 years.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.120]   I'm thinking about getting in technology.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:02.760]   What is the technology that you would do now that will be the next big thing?
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.800]   And I said, you know, it's pretty hard.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.000]   If you thought 15 years ago, you know, if you asked me 15 years ago and I were smart,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.280]   I might have said, well, you should write a chat app because you could make $6 billion
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.880]   when you sell it to Facebook.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.000]   What would you say 15 years from now?
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.840]   Is it battery technology?
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:21.840]   Solar charging?
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.200]   Is it renewable energy in general?
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.200]   Renewable energy?
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   Sure.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.000]   I also think smart things with voice.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000]   I mentioned voice.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.880]   I think the ability to talk to anything is important.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.640]   I think if you want to, kids want to get involved with some go into MEMS.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640]   That's the future.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.440]   Just kind of before nanotech microelectronic machinery.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.960]   You were the guy who explained MEMS to me.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:43.960]   I did.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:45.960]   Yes.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.960]   I had never heard of them.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960]   And apparently they're everywhere.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.000]   They're not molecular size, but they're very, very small.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000]   Right.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000]   The Kindle is an example.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]   The Kindle has MEMS.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.080]   Well, that's how that works.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.840]   That's what electronic ink is MEMS.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.840]   Yeah, it's just MEMS.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:57.840]   Interesting.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.280]   It's actually physically there.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   It's fine.
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.280]   Is an etch a sketch made of MEMS?
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.760]   I think that if it was electronic, you put a little battery in there that would be.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.400]   You could have an electronic etch a sketch.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.400]   I have one on my desk at work, and that thing gets so much play time.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:13.400]   The etch a sketch.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.800]   I have it on the far side of my desk, and people just pick it up.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.000]   When they be cool, you could have it be a screen.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   It's the original iPad.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.800]   Somebody tilled that.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.160]   All right, friends, this has been a fun show, but we, as with all good things, must call
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.800]   it a day.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.800]   Did I do everything chat?
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.400]   I didn't mention the t-shirt.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.920]   It's teespring.com/twit, T-double-e-s-p-r-i-n-g.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:44.320]   We do these t-shirts for 30 days only because we want to create some sort of perceived value,
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.680]   some sort of crazy demand that wouldn't exist otherwise.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.680]   I think that's wise.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.040]   It's a psychological trick.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]   I admit it.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.360]   I'm the first to admit it.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.280]   But it's also true that in 30 days, you will never be able to get this t-shirt again.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:59.280]   Yeah, like this is the commemorative t-shirt.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.680]   It's going to be a huge disappointment for people.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.680]   You wouldn't believe how many people...
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.160]   Is that the one you finally chose?
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.160]   What do you think?
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]   Looks good.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.160]   I kind of like the steampunk one.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.160]   Well, we own it.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.160]   We'll do another one.
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.160]   I like to, too.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.160]   Yeah, because it's weird.
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.160]   This was close.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]   Sorry, I used that word.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.160]   It's been one by 30 votes.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:17.160]   It's very good.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160]   With thousands of votes.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.160]   This one only by 30 votes.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.160]   No.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.160]   It was close.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.160]   Well, what came in second?
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.160]   Do you know what came in second?
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.160]   At least I don't remember.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:25.160]   It probably wasn't steampunk.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.160]   I don't think a lot of people...
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.160]   No, steampunk was losing, I think.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.160]   It was the lowest.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.960]   Anyway, you can't get it right now.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:30.960]   It's the Brick House.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.320]   It is our commemorative third anniversary shirt.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320]   We have it in a variety of colors and sizes.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.320]   Well, too.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.320]   Black and white.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320]   That's...
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320]   Too's a variety.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.320]   That's a variety.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:44.800]   And a variety of genders too, as well.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.760]   Male and female.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:50.040]   And we've sold 421 towards our goal of 300.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.640]   So I think we're well on our way.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:54.280]   But if you want it, just need to lose a few.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   Waste no time.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.280]   Teespring.com/TWIT.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.320]   Why don't I spell "Twit"?
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:02.480]   Of all the things that I just said, that's the easiest one.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.360]   Teespring is T-W-E.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.360]   Like T-shirt.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.280]   Mark, it's great to see you.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280]   Thank you for being here.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.280]   Coming all the way up.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.280]   My pleasure.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   Mark millions at Bloomberg Business Week where he covers international business, right?
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.560]   Bloomberg.com/globaltech.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.560]   Global Tech.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.040]   So this China story is right up your...
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:21.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.600]   We've been hammering away on that one.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.600]   Really?
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:24.600]   I'm still...
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.360]   I kind of wonder, you know, how do you resolve this when you get in this?
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.360]   And it's very hard for...
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.640]   You know what we didn't talk about.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.160]   We probably should have.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:36.640]   The judge who says Microsoft has to give up information on an Irish server, the US judge.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.560]   That has a huge global impact too, where a Canadian judge did something similar where
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:47.720]   these judges are making judgments in a nation that then reaches out into another nation.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.080]   He said, "Big problem."
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:51.920]   Microsoft fought that one, but lost.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.600]   It's good to have you.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.040]   Appreciate you're being here.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.480]   Alan Noventano, never been on Twitter before.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.960]   You did a yeoman job.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:04.360]   Actually, you did the job of a Navy chief.
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.360]   Thank you.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.920]   I'm really glad to have you here.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920]   Congratulations.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920]   And your new job.
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.600]   She's hiding in the back again.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:12.600]   wife.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.040]   Amy, and your new town, Florence Kentucky.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.440]   Thank you.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:22.240]   And you catch Alan on the PC perspective podcast, but also writing every day for PC per.com.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.240]   And I really wish...
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:24.880]   I guess you...
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:31.680]   I heard you talking about it on the podcast, but your SSD directory is so useful.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.440]   What are you going to do with that?
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.040]   I don't know.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.040]   I know you...
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.600]   I recommend it all the time.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.800]   I need to update that thing.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.720]   It turned into just an octopus.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.560]   It was insane trying to update that thing.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:49.400]   Because you were the first, one of the early guys to do review and rate different SSDs,
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.480]   and you came up with the fact that there are really some significant differences in the
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.480]   quality.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.480]   There were differences.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.480]   And the issue...
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:58.280]   Part of the reason that I haven't updated what used to be the SSD decoder, right?
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.280]   That started...
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.160]   It was just my own personal spreadsheet.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.160]   Just to try to keep track.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.160]   Just to try to keep track.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.720]   Because there were so many manufacturers and they all had different controllers and
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.520]   you didn't know what controller was in which drive.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:14.480]   And a given controller would perform similar depending on just across whichever brand it
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]   was for that model.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.560]   So that's what the SSD decoder thing was.
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:22.360]   The DCPer.com/SSD.
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.360]   But did you not recommend it anymore?
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.320]   Well everything is dated in there unfortunately now.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:32.800]   And the number of controllers and the number of manufacturers is not so unwieldy anymore.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.240]   It used to be that there was Sandforce was in like...
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.120]   Sandforce was in like 15 different brand.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.640]   There was kind of like a little race everybody wanted to have.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.640]   Everybody wanted to make an SSD.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.640]   Right?
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:47.080]   You're saying now, does it matter which SSD you buy now?
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.080]   Or not?
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.080]   Sure it does.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.080]   There's still differences.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:51.680]   But the number of controllers is now a little bit fewer.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   The best one to buy right now.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.680]   Yeah, what's the best?
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.680]   Period.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:56.680]   Intel.
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.680]   There has to be...
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.680]   Like cutter of SST.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.680]   There has to be at least two answers there.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.280]   Because there's one that's the best cost per gig.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:08.760]   Which I believe is the crucial either the MX100 or the M550.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]   Which is the...
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.520]   Which is why are cuter picked as the best SST.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:14.880]   They are insanely, insanely low cost per gig.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.280]   220 bucks for half a terabyte.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.280]   Right, that's amazing.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.600]   You're talking about 40 cents a gig.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.080]   Will they continue to get just as hard as they're still going?
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.080]   Yeah, and in the second half of the answer.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.280]   So the second half of the answer I would say is like the most nimble performer.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.280]   Right?
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:32.160]   Which right now is Samsung.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.680]   Like the 850 Pro.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.280]   Which actually uses 3D NAND.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.280]   3D NAND?
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.720]   The flash memory is made on the same die.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.280]   It's made 32 layers high.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.280]   And then...
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.680]   Is that the TLC you were talking about?
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.680]   No.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.680]   This is MLC.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.680]   It's a flash.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.480]   But usually when you make a chip it's all flat.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480]   Right?
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.480]   This is...
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480]   Okay.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.480]   Is that it?
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.480]   No.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.480]   Terabyte.
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.480]   How much is that?
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.480]   699 for a terabyte?
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.480]   It's not bad.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480]   So that just launched and the pricing is still kind of premium but really that is...
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:01.480]   No, not bad.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.480]   That is a very, very good performer.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.680]   How about those Evo's from Samsung?
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:05.680]   You like that?
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:10.480]   The Evo was the previous generation and I have a suspicion they're going to make a 850 Evo
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.480]   as well.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:13.080]   Using that same 3D flash.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.080]   And once that happens I think their cost per gig is going to start dropping in the 40s
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080]   as well like 40 cents per gig.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:19.080]   So it's just a matter of time.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.080]   I mean just that...
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.080]   Yeah, they just need to do it.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.960]   Everybody should have an SSD drive in their computer.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.480]   At least as their boot drive it just makes such a huge difference.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.480]   It is night and day.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.480]   It's incredible.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.680]   And these new PCI Express ones that Apple's been using and others now.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.680]   Yup.
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:33.680]   Really fast.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:34.680]   Yup.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:35.680]   Because you got that fast bus buying.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:36.680]   Thank you Alan.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.680]   I'm glad we could talk about that a little bit.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.880]   And I want to thank you Lindsey Ternstein for being here from CNET, the reviews editor
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.880]   there.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.880]   You're welcome.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.480]   Anything you want to plug besides your regular Monday appearance on TNT?
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.480]   Well that's obvious.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   That's a given.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   Obviously.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.480]   What do I want to plug?
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.280]   CNET's iOS app just got an update yesterday.
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.280]   Awesome.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:54.280]   And it's fantastic.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.480]   It's really, I'm actually thrilled with it.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.560]   I think we really started to think that the way people will consume podcasts for sure is
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:01.760]   on mobile apps.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.520]   And I think that's probably true for a lot of content, right?
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.520]   I think so too.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.940]   And you know, I think it's taken the whole industry a while to sort of sort out what
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:10.040]   the best way for a media app to work is.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:15.640]   We finally decided to create a situation where you can toggle between the programming that
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:16.640]   we do.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.160]   So we say these are the five or six or seven or eight or nine, ten stories you have to
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.160]   see right now.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.800]   Or you can just go to latest.
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:26.360]   And then we have so much content that it just, you know, you can go back to our issue.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:29.880]   We have all this back catalog, but we also want to highlight the current.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:30.880]   So we want featured stuff.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.880]   Right.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.400]   You know NPR one, their new app is very interesting.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:34.400]   It's simple.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.400]   It's got no controls at all.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.480]   That's just, you could go next.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.480]   That's basically how ours works.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.880]   It's either featured or next, latest.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.840]   And then it's just a lot of companies are starting to look at simplified because people
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.000]   just want to get, boom, get right into it.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000]   Absolutely.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000]   But of course it has all that.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000]   You know, if you, it's important to me, if you want to find out about a specific product,
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.280]   you can dig down pretty easily or you can scan, you know, you can scan codes.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.680]   If you're in the store, you can just scan a barcode.
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:00.760]   We're thinking about that too.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.680]   I think that's the current thinking in general is there's got to be two interfaces, simple
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.680]   and then deep.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.680]   So that's up.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.480]   We're going to be doing some really fun stuff in Kentucky.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.480]   Are you?
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:12.040]   Oh, that's tech republic.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:16.920]   No, well, there is tech republic, but we also have seen it itself.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.000]   We built a 12,000 square foot review facility in Louisville.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000]   Really?
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.440]   And we do smart home reviews there and we're working on some other exciting stuff later
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   in the year or two.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.640]   Might have to pay them a visit.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.320]   Is Kentucky have like an unusually low tax rate or something?
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.800]   I think it's, it's still in the low end.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.280]   It's a great place to hire because there's a great, there are a lot of educational facilities
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280]   here by.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.280]   Louisville's one of my favorite.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.280]   We do too.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.280]   I want to move to Louisville.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.280]   Okay.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.280]   You want to go to John?
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.280]   No, I want you to move there.
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.280]   Oh.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280]   So that's really fun.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.280]   We're doing a lot of smart home stuff.
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.360]   You know, you get to place in New York City like you promised.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:49.520]   We're talking with CUNY.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:53.440]   We've got to figure out the technology, but we, we, Jeff Jarvis and his dean there at
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.720]   the journalism school, we're talking about building a studio in the journalism school.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.720]   That would give us a time.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:00.160]   That's quite, I was thinking.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.160]   What did you want an apartment?
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:05.760]   John C. Devorak, you are where?
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:06.760]   What do you do?
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.760]   You, you would be?
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:09.680]   No agenda show.com twice a week.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.680]   Love that show.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.200]   I, you, a lot of people say that they've heard about it on Twitch and then they never
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.200]   won't go there.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:17.360]   I actually can I tell you the honest truth.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.360]   I know you don't believe this.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:19.360]   I have never heard it.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.560]   I have literally never heard that show.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.760]   I swear to God, that's weird.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:25.760]   You say that all the time.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:26.760]   It's funny.
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:27.760]   I know you don't believe it.
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:30.520]   Well, because you bring up references that apparently indicate you heard something.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:35.760]   See, this is why I don't listen because you believe there is no such thing as a coincidence
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:36.960]   or is that the other guy?
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.640]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.800]   John C. Devorak, channeldevorak.com, no agenda show.com.
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:46.560]   We do Twitch every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:50.320]   2,200 UTC right here on Twitch.tv.
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.840]   If you watch live, we love it.
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:55.360]   We see in the chat room, we talk, we do all that stuff.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:58.360]   But if you can't on-demand audio and video, always available after the fact, just go to
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:04.120]   Twitch.tv or, you know, Stitcher, iTunes, Xbox, music, wherever you find, you know, audio
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:08.520]   and video programming of a certain quality.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.320]   You can also use our apps.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320]   We don't do them ourselves.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.440]   We have these great third-party developers.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.680]   There are Twitch apps for iOS, for Android.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:21.000]   There's a great app for Windows, phone, even things like Roku, Samsung, TV, Z1.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000]   So thank you.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000]   Please watch.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000]   We appreciate it.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000]   Subscribe if you can.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000]   And we'll see you next week.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   Another Twitch.
