[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   Coming to us from
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.380]   CBS interact good evening. This is where New York
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.700]   Yeah, I'm at CBS news in a little focus room here. This is Brooklyn

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560]   Hey, everything is great
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.320]   So I am working for CNET as a producer but embedded at CBS news
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.760]   So we are covering hard news, but how technology impacts the entire news cycle as no
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.720]   In the last decade or so tech has gone from being a vertical to a horizontal
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.040]   So it's my job to help news understand tech
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   Good luck
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   Can you talk to our government to

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   I am great. Your voice is recovered a little bit from your show a little bit a little bit a little bit
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   It'll be broken again next week though. That's awesome. She's a she's a punk rocker and roll singer
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.560]   with the band sick burn among others
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.880]   And Philip Elmer to it who gave up his punk career some years ago used to be at CBGB on a regular basis
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.120]   He is now the man in charge at ped30 p ed30.com
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.400]   Is a news blog good to have you, Philip
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.240]   You know, I I learned I was trained once how to punch words like like Dan does you can tell he's worked in television
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.280]   Yes, that's funny. I forgot everything. I can't do it
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   I
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.920]   I tried, you know, I worked in radio for 40 years. I've worked in television for several decades
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.720]   And I just can't punch the words
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.760]   The only time I could do it is if I do my Walter krung krung impression
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.560]   Then I can do it
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.320]   I'm sitting next to an Emmy that was given to rote Walter Wow
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.200]   See there's history there at cbs the tiffany is this broadcast center is falling apart, but it's also loaded
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.440]   That was the history of journalism. That was my experience too
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   I was so excited to go to nbc and 30 rock go up in the elevator
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   To do the today show and the paint's peeling on the windowsills
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.720]   It's just
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.040]   You know it looks better from afar
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.320]   The illusion has been broken everything looks better from everything looks better from afar
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.960]   Your studio is is tight and crisp and freshly painted
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.720]   Have you been here?
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.040]   Well, it's been so long. We keep it up pretty
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.160]   I have a very good team that keeps up pretty nice, but it's also not as old as cbs or nbc
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.240]   Someday it'd be fun, wouldn't it?
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.400]   Not yet in the leo loport memorial studio. Yeah leo used to work here
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.200]   No, that'll never happen
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.040]   a monday apple monday weirdly enough apple decided to do a
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.200]   an event at the steve jobs theater a glittering event they practically had
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   a
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.560]   Red carpet
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.640]   Had jon rivers been still alive. She probably would have welcomed the celebrities. There's a big picture
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.840]   apple took before the event
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   Of all of the celebrities gathered. I don't see if I can find that
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.840]   It was it was it was vanity fair worthy. It was very impressive and not all the celebrities
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   took the stage
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Only a handful did but for some reason they had many more people
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.560]   Uh, let's see picture celebrities steve jobs theater. That should that should be the google food to get this
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.320]   I needed an annotated version. I didn't know half these people. Yeah me too. I kept I kept mistaking
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.840]   Uh, reese witherspone for drew barramore
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.760]   And octavius spencer for oprah wind free. No, I knew that was oprah. Who else could wear superman's cape and a bolo tie
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.400]   holy cow
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.840]   Look at that. There's the moment remember the moment when bono and uh tim cook touched fingers
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   The uh when that when this moment right here on stage with oprah wind free happened
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.880]   I leaned over to rene and was like oh, thank goodness. No awkward high five just happened
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.040]   No, but um
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.760]   In the meat era. I think it's kind of interesting that tim is studiously avoiding touching oprah and she's rubbing his belly
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.880]   Like for good luck
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.880]   And he's gone
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.000]   From his eye afterwards. He did he wiped a tear. You know why he started crying when oprah said
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   Billions of phones in the in their pockets y'all billions. That was when tim went yes
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.800]   Yes, that's the way to talk about it oprah
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   Um, here's a big guy. I think this is the rock. I don't know who that is some muscle bound. No, it's not
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.600]   It's a caldrogo. It's it is. It's caldrogo. That's right
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.800]   That's the only thing I know him from even though I know he's more famous Jason mimoa of aquaman fame
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   Who completely that's alpha. What are they star in a show?
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.200]   And i'm reading the captions called see
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.560]   The premise is in in set in the distant future all of humanity is blind
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.320]   Moving on here. They are in front of a picture of water
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.760]   They can't see which they can't see
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.720]   Because it's a green
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.440]   Max stream saver actually that's just the background of Max
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.800]   What the funniest thing was there's these long these are all blackouts, right? They don't they don't give the celebrities
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.760]   You know, they don't make them walk on and off stage in the light. So the lights go dark
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.280]   Wait, it does seem like a long time in the theater for let's watch this stream
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.920]   Wait, this one was particularly long because they had to bring the box out big bird and his and his puppet friend
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.600]   Yeah, and they had to they had to sort of escort big bird out too because obviously it's really difficult
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   He can't walk
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.800]   So yeah, he needed a lot of help. Could you see in the uh, so you were there too, philip
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.440]   Yeah, nice. Could you see in the theater that them coming on stage or was it just as dark there?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.840]   Oh, totally black. Wow, totally black
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.640]   It I think it was intended to be dramatic. It didn't
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.120]   That kind of didn't work
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   The weird scary as hell. Here's steven spielberg very tweedy in a vest and tweed jacket
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.640]   With a picture of steven spielberg looking like steve jobs is all I can all I could say
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.560]   It's just it's just kind of weird there's tim in his sneaks
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.400]   and uh
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.360]   He's looking he looks kind of collegiate like a you know professor tim
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.400]   kind of cute
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.720]   New me mojis. I don't know why we're seeing that
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.360]   I don't think we're in the right show now
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   You never did just
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.760]   I went to jennifer aniston's 50th birthday party. I couldn't resist
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.880]   Uh, i'm in the hollywood life section
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.600]   There's a reese who I still think of as true. I don't know why
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.680]   Uh
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.000]   That's jennifer. No, that's not jennifer. That's when oh this miss goop
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.880]   This did i'm sorry this did not and I do not intend to this to be the celebrity gossip show. This is a tech show
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   We're talking about the apple event celebrity and tech have now intertwined. So I guess we're gonna cover celebrities now, aren't we?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.640]   So uh good. I'm glad you guys were there dan. Uh, you probably were we're not
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:02.840]   Yeah, we streamed it, but yeah, I mean the fascinating event and and it's fascinating for metal levels as well as uh apple's
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.480]   obvious shift to
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.680]   services
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:14.120]   It I mean the impact of this on the creative sector will be really fascinating to watch what they didn't show or all of the
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.480]   Workers on the back end of all of these services whether it's new services
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.920]   media and television and entertainment
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:30.360]   Or gaming all of these services are are in some way now in the pocket of apple and
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.880]   What's up for debate at least?
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   In the communities we chatter with is you know, what will this do to premium services?
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.360]   Will it commodify premium services or will it elevate them?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.760]   So you know, you know what else they didn't show
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.560]   Uh at that event and yet you sort of had to be there to to get the full
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.880]   uh
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.560]   Lack was you know, they've been working for nearly two years nearly as long as robert muller
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.040]   Uh, they've had
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   a new unit of time a muller
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.120]   A muller one muller one muller. That's a long unit time in the short unit time as a scaramucci
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.680]   And they um
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.960]   You know, they had the two guys two producers from sony who made breaking bad and the crown and all that's that was the guy that
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.840]   Those are the behind they didn't get any credit, but those are the guys who brought in all of these celebrities, right?
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.760]   Yeah, yeah, uh, they also weren't quite introduced right and then uh, so we were we all gather
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.160]   I thought we were going to see some trailers
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.240]   um
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.000]   And uh, so these guys stand up and they talk about the show they're going to have and they show a slide
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.040]   Uh one slide from whatever they're doing and it it's a real wide angle slide and it wraps around the stadium all the way
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.360]   The sides of the walls
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:58.840]   Uh, which which are not flat. So it's just like this weird stripey line going around the theater
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.600]   When and we're keep waiting for it to move because we want to see what they've been shooting and they never show it
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.920]   And what they do show is the so-called sizzle reel, which is like a little over a minute of snapp snippets
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.200]   And one tv guy afterwards. I was saying well, they did show the snippet real and he looked up angry
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.280]   The snipper reel don't count
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.360]   No, and in fact, uh, people who are in the media said this looked like an upfront
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.480]   Those are the events that the networks have to pitch new shows to advertisers
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.840]   And of course they bring out the celebrities and to not just advertisers
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.680]   But affiliates the stations in the network and they bring out the celebrities because that's who the affiliate guys and the advertisers
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.080]   Want to see but they always show
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.320]   Eclipse here's the here's the hero shot with uh, Oprah in the middle
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.120]   And by the way, they all changed their clothes
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.840]   This is before the event that's right. That's right. They're all wearing different clothes
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   Which is just how hollywood this was?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.640]   Are you sure this is higher than Photoshop B2B?
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.520]   This is in the steve jobs theater see on the right that elevator that goes down to the theater
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.560]   We now know what that giant open space on the first floor is for because it's never been used
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   It was forgetting all these celebrities together in one shot many of them did not get on stage
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.640]   Those who did were completely different outfits. There's m night shamaland. There's adjacent momoa
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.160]   But there's also people who didn't get on stage people like jennifer garner
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.640]   um
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.840]   Uh, what's his name? Jess jesse from breaking bad
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.000]   erin paul
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.960]   Um, there's a bunch of celebrities here who did not get uh their shot in the limelight including the luckiest little girl in the world
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.000]   I don't know who she is. I think she's in c
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.960]   Of course, she's too young to really appreciate what she's experiencing here, but
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.280]   That's a lot of stories wise beyond her years and doesn't understand. Yes, my agent said I wouldn't have to see you that long
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   Give me a cigarette
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.600]   Leo are you sure that wasn't photoshopped? This is not this is all these people were all in the theater
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.960]   That's how I know that sure. I don't know that for sure. Did you see them all? I don't know that
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.640]   No, I didn't see them. There's been there's not not everybody
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.280]   But there has been other little video clips that kind of popped up on social means and I think
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.760]   Uh leo you had shown one that was over uh, yeah, um
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.560]   Yeah, um
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.080]   Garner and yeah
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.240]   So people that were not up on stage some people that were not up on stage have kind of popped up as part of like
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.280]   You know people just putting up video clips of them
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.320]   So um though it's not everyone that's on that stage confirmed
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.960]   There are a few people that were not on stage that were at the event that we never saw as far as I know
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.840]   They weren't sitting in the audience. I even did a quick scan
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.760]   obviously I was in the way back so I'm not going to be able to tell from sitting the back looking down but I
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.480]   I would think that there would have been more
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.760]   Sort of hype or fervor around any celebrities sitting in one of the front rows
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.560]   So I'm not sure that they were even in the theater. I think they might have been in a different area
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.560]   Oh, they were in the celebrity section of course. There probably is a secret
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.080]   Place one of the things I did have to note and I'm sure apple wasn't happy about this
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.480]   Not a lot of apple watches in evidence on these rich and famous people a lot of nice watches
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.400]   But I only count one or two apple watches and even those are maybe not apple watches
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.760]   So and even from people that have like in the past sort of shown off their apple
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.880]   You got a figure Tim Cook says dude. I gave you that $25,000 go watch you're not wearing it
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.240]   But that was series zero man. I'm not going to keep wearing that
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.600]   Give me the new one
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.320]   Somebody tweeted and I think this was an apt tweet
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.680]   That hollywood is the only industry that loves itself as much as apple loves itself
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.280]   And so it's a matchmaiden heaven. Isn't it really if you think about it
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.720]   It's very self-congratulatory all of this
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:00.120]   Although each all those celebrities are being paid by apple to make their shows. It's not like they're
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.840]   Falling over themselves to get on the platform
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.000]   Let me say one thing about the up front. It's in the up the audience for the up front
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.280]   It's very clear is for the advertisers to let them know what's coming
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.280]   They buy they buy ad time at that point. There's no ads right here, right?
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.520]   No, this is an up front for the people who had subscribed to the service
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.880]   That's what you'd think but
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.080]   Then you'd think you'd show some tv shows so that we'd be attracted to the service
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.280]   I've got a new theory that there are two other audiences that we're not thinking of
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:39.480]   It really wasn't an audience for the journalists because I know I was disappointed and I wasn't the only one right that that we didn't see more tv
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.120]   the
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.480]   I think the the audiences were a wall street
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.640]   Which which needed to be persuaded or it needed to be underlined that we're switching to services
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:59.400]   And b was the creative the hollywood community that they they're saying look we've got Oprah
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.960]   We've got Jennifer, you know, we've got all these people
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:10.200]   We're we're look how much we're promoting them come to our platform to make your exclusive stuff for us
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.520]   This is a b2v event
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:21.160]   Yeah, like that or actor to actor event or director to the director event and in fact the one real the one piece they did show
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.120]   Which was very I thought
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   Disharmonius was a bunch of directors spielberg and shamalon and others talking about how hard their job was
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.440]   and i thought
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.880]   Really that's what you want to talk about here not what a great show you've made
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   What a wonderful partnership with apple just how fella I would to do what you do I would argue
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.200]   That there is one additional audience and that was the rest of the tech industry
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.520]   And that is for the same point that this was a demonstration. This is a show of force right?
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.920]   That is a show for sure power to say to the other actors in the tech industry particularly amazon and netflix
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.320]   Look what we have that you don't
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.560]   Yeah, definitely
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.080]   I'm saying
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.960]   They're jumping board or or you're gonna see how much you're gonna lose out if you don't join us and
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.280]   I combine yeah
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.400]   Now philip you're like me an old time apple fan
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.160]   And uh in the early days I embraced apple
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.760]   Because it was the computer for the rest of us. It was almost
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.560]   Hippie it was I mean steve jobs was a hippie. It was
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.920]   Counterculture it was those guys in the suits back to the 1984 commercial those guys in the suits use ibm
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.960]   Worth the creatives
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.240]   Worth the we think different we're the lucky one, you know the crazy crazy ones were
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.800]   This is despicable from that point of view. I find this
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.800]   Horrible this is apple as the one percent
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.480]   What aspect of it is despicable
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:04.760]   Well, what's been happening to me over the last few years apple
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.840]   Okay, this is the most negative description. You can all shoot me down
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.880]   What has happened to me as somebody who loved apple as the crazy ones
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:20.920]   apple has seen a plateau in its sales and more importantly I think a plateau
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.080]   And its ability to innovate they haven't been able to find that secret sauce
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:31.560]   Uh since the ipad may be the apple watch certainly not people say the airpods come on really that's the
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   The best you can come up with so there's this kind of plateauing of
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.320]   Innovation and what happens when a company gets to that point is sales
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.040]   Plateau as well because there's no reason to buy the new thing if it's no better than the old thing
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.720]   And we've seen this in other industries the car industries are good example
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.320]   They really weren't able to improve on cars much after the 50s
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.160]   So they added fins they added chrome it became a fashion industry and to me
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.080]   Everybody's talking about this is a pivot of apple from being a hardware company
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.400]   To a services company. This is continuing the pivot apple's been making ever since the apple watch
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.120]   from a counterculture
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.560]   Creative company to a fashion
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.760]   Uh company they're all about
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.400]   Fashion and why fashion because fashion you got to buy a new one every season
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.080]   Doesn't matter that the hem lines are you know
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.480]   Better they're not better. They're just different. That's why you have to buy a new outfit and I think that's unfortunately
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   What's happened to apple and I I for one i'm disappointed and I think if you look at the mackintosh
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.320]   If if you look at the stuff that apples put out lately it has been a grave disappointment
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.560]   Now all you know here is didn't go ahead. I'll let i'll let you go. Dan and then and then philip go ahead
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.360]   Yeah, sorry philip
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.200]   We have been trained to expect innovation on a pretty
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.640]   Unreasonable schedule meaning like every six 12 and 18 months
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:09.960]   And what apple did is is capitalized in the last decade decade nap capitalized on
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.800]   Uh the emergence and growth of gadgets in a technology ecosystem that was fairly sustainable. We could grow from
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.240]   uh
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.840]   the miniaturization of things like the ipod into
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.000]   3g and then 4g because those were fairly fast iterations in the technology that supported
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.960]   Uh the miniaturization of devices, but the next real innovations are going to be
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:44.040]   uh the internet of things data and maybe powered by 5g although these things are all coming a lot slower than how we've been trained to expect
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:51.400]   Uh the the tech innovation cycle to flow. So it's just going to take a lot longer for things like
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.720]   5g to power
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.640]   Iot and iot is just not as understandable by a consumer audience as something like a
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Mini pocketable supercomputer. So yes, it's an industry wide problem
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.480]   But apple will not be on the forefront of 5g
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.120]   No
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.960]   Go ahead philip
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.640]   Well, you raised a lot of points. Let's see if we can separate them. Um in terms of fashion
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.640]   uh
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.800]   You know hiring they had a burberry's is uh
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.880]   Uh
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.360]   It plays right into your your argument. She's gone
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.280]   oddly enough
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.760]   Maybe there wasn't enough fashion for angel irons
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:38.680]   I see that strategy as looking at their install base, which is huge and and which is rich
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.600]   billion phones y'all
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.960]   And uh and marketing to it, you know
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:50.840]   They know who their customers are they know what kind of disposable income they have a lot of the customers can afford to buy
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   A new color watch band whenever they change their suit
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.680]   And you know there's money to be made they're not leaving it on the table
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.840]   It's it's certainly not Steve jobs in an ashram, but it's it's understandable what they're doing
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:12.280]   The other thing though about innovation is I tend to think of apple kind of like the pixar of technology
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.840]   Uh, they make hits
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:21.880]   Uh, they they do screw up from time to time where his pixar doesn't but they you know they've got this system for
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:30.760]   Reit for iterating and and they've got they you know, they've got really good access to the next technology that's coming
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:39.000]   Uh, they they hire some pretty smart engineers. So i'm assuming that what we have right now is sort of the interregnum
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440]   uh
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.720]   between
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.160]   the watch and the
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.200]   Uh and the airpods which i disagree about the airpods. I think the airpods are are magnificent
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.400]   Uh, piece of technology that nobody else can equal right now
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   Uh, because apple can miniaturize better than a lot of their competitors
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:02.600]   But that that apple i assume is working on other stuff and we hear rumors and of things about
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.440]   You know
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:11.240]   The glasses with with things printed on them on the inside and cars way way down if that ever happens
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.840]   Uh
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.880]   You're assuming that apple is is going to fail at those things
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.280]   I'm assuming based on their track record that they'll probably deliver something
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:27.480]   Either they'll deliver something that's pretty pretty compelling or they'll drop it like the uh airpower
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.680]   You know if if it ain't good, they're not going to make it
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.040]   Anyway, that's that's my take on what you're saying there
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.080]   You still have hope for the future
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.760]   What you're saying makes a lot of sense though that
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.200]   What what else is a company going to do when it's gotten as big as it can possibly get it has to figure out
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.960]   A way to keep having people true
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.280]   You know participate in it and if apple were you know like it was in the 80s and it never grew
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.760]   Then it would have been just this great little niche thing for creatives and hippies
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   And it didn't though it grew so now it is trying to find another way and I I think what you're saying about it being sort of
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:12.200]   Aligned more with fashion makes a lot of sense and is certainly a great a great way for apple to market
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:19.080]   The future their future is to get people interested in needing a reason to upgrade every single year and just like a new
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.480]   pair of pants
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.680]   Yeah, your current pair of pants are fine, but you want to upgrade because it's the new trend so yeah
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.960]   It's it that's actually great analogy and makes a lot of sense and and honestly, that's good business
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   I'm not saying it's bad business, but it
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.720]   For some I wish apple were selling the steak still and not the sizzle
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   Right, but if you if you were to
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.680]   With that kind of like, you know in hindsight, I wish apple
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.440]   You wouldn't have the job you have right now if apple were only selling the steak right it would have been too small of a company
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.840]   It couldn't have grown big enough to become something that the rest of us can actually sustain a career based off of you know what I mean
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.920]   I don't base my career on apple. Thank god
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.560]   Well, you know
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.120]   Technology and I don't get invitations to apple
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.920]   Why I can't why who knows no one knows I never asked apple and I don't care to know it's fine because we cover it here
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.520]   uh apple lately has started to get a little
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.800]   And I don't know if it's apple to blame or the general trend in tech
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.360]   And google's youtube adhering to it, but we keep getting taken down
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.120]   Uh, we don't we no longer with the last time apple little live event
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.400]   We streamed it on youtube live as we always did with commentary fair use
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.440]   And it was taken down and in fact not just taken down but our whole youtube live channel was down for a month
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.960]   So we no longer can stream apple events on youtube
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:49.480]   Uh, we put portions of the apple event in our show ios today and mac break weekly those were taken down
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.160]   We appealed and they got put back up pretty quickly because it is legal fair use
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.880]   It's a news show commenting on an apple event
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.920]   Uh, but I think app i it's possible apple has upped its campaign against us. I don't know
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.600]   Uh, but I don't care. We're gonna cover the story
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   Regardless
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.760]   Uh, and i'm not mad at apple. I still buy apple stuff. It's not that i'm mad at them
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.240]   I'm disappointed if anything
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.760]   Uh, and and maybe you're right philip. Maybe that innovation is out in the distance and there's nothing to be had right now
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.080]   Certainly an apple's not a lot not alone. Silicon valley is in this doldrums
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.040]   Right now, but I look at things like apple pay which had great promise and has not taken off
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.120]   So apple's trying to show that up with apple card
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:40.920]   Apple pay i don't know what 10 billion purchases this year they're talking about. Yeah, I think of all
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.000]   Digital payment forms. It's taken off more than anything at all
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.880]   Uh, I think it's widely considered a failure because really yeah people still need these critics. I disagree
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.920]   Well, yeah
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.240]   But well, but that's part of the problem and and
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.120]   one of the reasons
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   you um
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.000]   Create a credit card if you're apple
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.360]   Is because apple pay isn't as successful as they would like it to be
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.920]   Now it's not it's not I guess we can debate the success of apple pay or not but uh
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:21.960]   It's not as universal as they'd like uh not i mean in europe and australia apparently everybody takes apple pay
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.280]   They don't in the us they're pretty good in greenfield, massachusetts actually but
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:33.480]   Uh and and that's the reason for the card if if they don't take apple pay at that particular register used you pull out your
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.080]   Titanium card and you stick it in and you're done. I guess I guess you could say apple pay is a success
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.560]   For the us
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.880]   But is dwarfed by uh like mobile payments in every other country china for it. Look here's a graph
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.160]   China mobile payments versus us mobile payments
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.520]   Uh, the you can't even see the us bars. They're the dark red ones way down at the bottom
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.520]   Um china's the pink ones way at the top and this is in uh
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.240]   trillion that's two
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   15,000 apple competing
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.120]   Against yeah, this is older so us vendors like pay pal
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:17.640]   Uh and venmo, which is owned by pay pal uh, so I I wonder if when we look at market char we talk about market char
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.400]   Yeah globally. It's I mean it's dwarfed by other
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.520]   markets, but if we look at the market that is just uh
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   payment transfer platform
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.280]   Transfer for platforms, uh apple pay may have done okay
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.360]   Yeah, I don't need to debate the success or failure of apple pay
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.240]   It clearly the reason for the card is to is to uh
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.120]   Stimulate its growth
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.040]   And I think that the card is maybe the most interesting thing apple announced on monday
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.280]   By the way, I one more thing before we get to the card
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.520]   Only one thing that apple showed is available now and that's news plus
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:01.880]   Which is a very little changed version of the texture app that they bought added to apple news
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.760]   Um
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.840]   Everything else is down the road a piece the card may be in the summer
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.800]   Uh the tv and the arcade
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:19.320]   In the fall no prices announced for those so these are very early announcements of the other three products
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.920]   But I think the credit card potentially is huge for apple
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.680]   It's it's got a lot of keen features. Um the the three percent
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.960]   Cash back the next day
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.800]   Uh
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.280]   They're not the only ones who do that, but it's one of the nice things
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.000]   They're not even the largest of the I mean somebody said, uh, okay 3% on apple purchases
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.360]   By the way, it's only 2% on everything else but 3% on apple purchases or I can go to target by with my target card and get 5
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.080]   Laurie, I think you were talking about this on tuesday. Yeah that it isn't necessarily the best credit card deal out there
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.440]   You've really got to look at it carefully definitely. I you know, um
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.720]   Was it tech crunch that put out something that had a little more detail? They talked about how it worked
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.000]   Yeah, that was a good article. I don't know how Matthew pins arena. I don't know how he
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.920]   Found that stuff out, but there was some really interesting little tidbits in there that actually I was impressed with for the the biggest one
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.040]   I um mistakenly assumed that
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.960]   The interest rate that you would get which is between 13 and 24
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.360]   If you miss a payment or have a late payment that you would be, um
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.160]   Uh charged a late rate
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.800]   We all reported that and panzerino said that's not true
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:40.360]   That to me is a really big deal that that they're not going to charge a late interest rate because that is exactly one of those
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.480]   um high expenses that makes
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.360]   um
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.280]   It I'd rather have a late fee than to have my my interest rates go up
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:55.000]   Even one or two percent because that that goes forever until you can reevaluate your your interest rate or your um
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.880]   Uh your credit score. So that's such a big deal that they are not going to do that that there's no late fee and there's no interest rate charge
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:11.640]   Um based off of off of whether or not you have a miss payment or a late payment on that so that to quote Matthew apple card has no late fees and
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.880]   No penalty rates
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.080]   You'll continue to pay your agreed upon interest rate on your outstanding balance
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.000]   It will impact your credit score. So this is an important thing to point out
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.760]   All the privacy apple talked about aside. They're still reporting
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:35.080]   All transactions and payments to Equifax experience and transunion. Yeah, yeah and speaking of um credit scores. I tried to find out
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.720]   Uh what the cutoff was because yeah because interest rates 13 to 24
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.920]   Depending on your credit right but some people may not won't be able to get an apple card at all
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.000]   Uh if your credit
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   Oh, yeah
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.200]   Score is in the toilet apple's not gonna give you a card anymore than anybody else was
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.520]   Right
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.920]   So we're trying to find out what the score is and someone told me that it was going to be 800
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.760]   Which is extraordinarily high that's very hard to maintain. No one has an 800
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   Well, I have an 800 and it's dead on arrival if that's what it is
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.760]   It won't from an else. So I read somewhere else that it was probably 70 plus which is more like it
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.320]   It from apple literature it sounds like
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.280]   They'll take your credit. They'll they'll give you the card, but they're going to adjust your
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.160]   um interest rates depending on how bad your
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.280]   So this is what panzerino says apple interest rates
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:28.760]   Aren't really much different than other credit cards. The lowest is 13.24. The highest is 24
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.800]   Ooh
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.080]   Um, but he says apple will do something innovative
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.360]   They'll place users who sign up at the lower end of the tier they land in due to their credit score
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.040]   So they you may get a lower rate from apple. You'll have to
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.440]   I think the most important thing and this is what I've been telling people is
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.360]   Don't just say oh, it's apple. It's a titanium card. I haven't have to have it
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.000]   Uh, but but actually compare rates using nerd wallet or something like that to see
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.880]   What the rate you're going to get but if this is true then apple might give you a better rate for your credit score than others will
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.680]   I don't know what the bottom with the minimum is
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:13.960]   And speaking of innovation a guy from england that that watches the
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.920]   The tech what's it called fin tech?
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.840]   Industry says that there's a lot of innovation and turmoil and fin tech in europe
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.920]   Uh, there's a company there's a bank a german bank called a 26
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.600]   That already sells metal cards or gives out metal cards
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.680]   Like my american express is a metal card right right because you have the platinum
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:40.040]   Um, uh, and eight and the eight twenty six card already works with apple pay. I mean, it's
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.520]   Uh, this thing is already being done
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:51.000]   Yeah, most of these elements are already being done in europe and apple is is catching up to the fin tech innovation that's sweeping the rest of the world
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.600]   It did it cracked me up that the only traditional apple
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.560]   Video of a product announcement at this event was the titanium card
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.320]   And they you know that the laser burning in all of that so
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.720]   Um, that pretty that that amused me
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.920]   Um
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.480]   All right apple card potentially good again. We don't we won't know till the details are out there
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.840]   There were a lot of uh footnotes on the apple web page
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:25.800]   Uh that you had to read to figure out exactly what you were getting 1 cash back on regular credit card transactions
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:32.520]   2 on apple pay transactions 3 on purchases from apple. It's cash immediately delivered to your balance
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.480]   I think the next day the next time the next
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.360]   Not next cycle. I think they said
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.320]   on at the event right away, but
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.000]   Anyway, but you know, I don't know how do you get the money?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.800]   If that has anything to do with what they've changed with apple apple cash it would be
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.920]   for a 25 cent
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.120]   Or I think it was 25 cents or 1 charge you can get it immediately
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.680]   Or you can wait till next day
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.840]   Which is that that's pretty normal for those kind of like peer-to-peer style things
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.920]   So it it's probably something similar to that where if you need your
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:14.600]   You know 1 2 or 3 cash back right now to give you two gallons of gas or something like that
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.760]   You can pay that 25 cent fee or you can just wait until it goes into your bank account
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.720]   Be prepared to set up an automatic transfer from your bank
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.240]   That's how you pay your balance a CH from a bank account
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.320]   Or if you've accumulated enough apple cash via apple cash
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   Uh the physical card is not a touch to pay card, which cracks me up
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.600]   You
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.320]   You gotta use your uh, you gotta use your phone and your watch
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.680]   You'd have to put a radio in it. Uh if we're gonna be touched to pay
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.640]   Well, a lot of credit cards are though, aren't they? I mean, yeah, okay
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.800]   Isn't that what I and I am very uh
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.080]   I have no experience or very little experience with this
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:58.120]   But the credit cards that you would use in in European countries that um have the chip in it
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:03.320]   Isn't that what makes it an international credit card and you can't you need the chip
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.040]   Doesn't mean you can touch to pay
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.960]   Okay, that's the difference the chip has nothing to do with whether or not it's tapped to pay right?
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.440]   Yeah, that's my understanding sometimes you have to put the you know you have a chip card
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.480]   You put it in there and you let it sit for a while and right right right?
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.160]   Yeah, I have to admit I use apple pay whenever I can because I wear an apple watch all the time
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.400]   And it is the most convenient way if you have an apple watch
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:28.520]   Also, it's so much faster than the chip readers the chip readers chip readers actually are so slow
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.400]   Yeah, uh, all right. I think they're gonna make money on this. Um, there's no fees
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   Uh, there's no international transaction fee, which makes it good
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.320]   I mean what they didn't say what the exchange rates would be they could easily make a little extra money by
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.760]   Fiddling with the exchange rate. I'm not sure they'll make money. I think they'll I think they're just
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   Building the wall around the wall garden thicker, you know, the that's really what this is. Isn't it?
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.360]   That's exactly what this is and it's one step closer to your devices being a subscription
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.240]   Everything is just a subscription and you pay a fee, right? It makes a lot of sense
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.600]   Everything works better if you just would just stop fighting it and use all apple products
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.720]   Exactly. Honestly
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.400]   I mean the iPhone has been a subscription for at least mine for the last two years or so, right?
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.000]   You do that because you know you're gonna you want a new iPhone every year
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.240]   Yeah, and I I mean I use android devices as well
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.800]   Uh, and I I used the two against each other at least the feature sets
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:35.240]   Uh, but yeah, my primary personal devices in all and then I know that all right. This is going to cost me
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.800]   XYZ every year whether I'm paying monthly or annually. It really doesn't matter and I
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:48.680]   Remain in apple customers. So I think their hope is let's retain our customers customer retention, right?
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.160]   Yep
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.200]   All right, let's take a break we can there if you want to talk more apple. We should we could talk about the arcade
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:03.320]   Uh, which again like google stadia announcement of the week before is a really kind of a sketch not a filled-in
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.640]   uh promise and then if you want apple tv plus and uh
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.160]   There's still a lot more to talk about so
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.000]   We will continue with our oh and yes airpower
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.120]   We hardly knew the glory gill for my more. She's managing editor philip elmer de witt ped 30

[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.880]   um
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.160]   First apple news any thoughts on that all you are in the news business
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.920]   I'm actually loving apple news on my on my ipad mini. It's the best
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.000]   It's this tiny little, you know magazine thing that I hold in my hand every morning
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.880]   I I just read through a bunch of things all the time. I love this. I love it so much better than slipboard better than google
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.880]   News better than any of the competition
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:45.000]   I've been using the other competition all along and since news plus came out
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.360]   I've just kind of
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.400]   I've hyper focused myself into the news app instead of kind
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.200]   I would kind of jump from one to the other to the other and I love the magazines is the is the key
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.280]   It's that's what I'm just
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:56.840]   a
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:02.680]   digesting all of these long-form stories that I can go to the internet to read a lot of news related stuff but these
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.480]   in-depth features and
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:12.520]   Profiles and things like that. That's where I'm just really getting just a lot of information that I can't just easily get by
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:17.320]   Reading scrolling through google news or something like that. So yeah, I'm really loving it
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.920]   Phillip well, you know, I've worked too long in the magazine industry
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.800]   I
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.360]   I love long-form journalism, but um
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.320]   I'm kind of burned out on it and you know when you see 300 magazines
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:41.000]   All at once it's so daunting. It's like having a stack a year's worth of New Yorkers stacked up that you haven't read
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.040]   Um, but it is, you know, I've shown it to people in their their jaws drop
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.360]   It's it's it's an it's incredible access to a lot of great stuff
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:56.600]   I think you're not supposed this is kind of kind of what apple did to the record album with a 99 cent single
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.640]   You're not supposed to think of it as a bunch of magazines
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.440]   You're supposed to look at the curated front page
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.680]   And you just get some you know articles. It doesn't even matter what magazine
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.040]   And you might pick those individual ones, right
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.120]   You're talking about news or news plus I think it's I think it's
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.480]   Disaggregating magazines not the other way around
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.440]   Well, you can see the whole list of your location
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.840]   Go ahead, Dan
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.800]   Well, I I am a fan of news plus
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.600]   And we'll spend money on it, but I'm concerned at least I'm I'm a little
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:37.080]   Worried about the the potential for commodification, especially when I scroll through there and I see
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:44.680]   Uh blue chip brands right next to thousands or well in this case dozens of other brands that have never heard of yeah
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.720]   And
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.240]   You know putting
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:53.800]   magazines that have a lot of not just time and energy but money sunk into them right next to stuff that doesn't is
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.720]   concerning
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.960]   All right. I I have two complaints
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:04.440]   One is a long-standing complaint with apple news in general and they're not the only ones but for some reason and
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.480]   It's I think it's a production error
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.880]   All the headlines are truncated
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.440]   and I just drives me nuts because
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.200]   Opinion 500 thousand dollars a year yet struggling l dot dot dot hot Costco dad charms internet after he
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.760]   Dot dot dot
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.480]   Let me go to some some magazine stories
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:32.600]   Some of I guess the magazine headlines are quite as long but nevertheless can the us afford democrats bold purr
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.320]   I guess I could figure that one out boozie recipes that require a whole bot
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.800]   Hey, Leo, this is to me a production flaw and they've never fixed this drives me nuts
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.880]   Do you have it enlarged for old guys with bad eyes? Maybe that's my problem. Do you not get this?
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.600]   I don't know
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:46:00.760]   On mine most of the time it shows the full um, okay, so that's my fault. All right, but but what you're saying is actually
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:07.960]   It it's a design flaw that just because you've increased the the font so that you can see it better
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.760]   I think that it's it's important for us to be able to
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.960]   Digest the information the way the the
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.160]   The way it was originally intended to be digested
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:23.400]   So the fact that it truncates the headline can be very frustrating. Um, I think on on the iPad
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.520]   I had it all the way up so i'm so you're saying
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.880]   Turn it to the middle. Where do you where do you have your setting?
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.080]   You're an old guy. I fill up where
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.880]   But I work classes so
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.000]   Where do you have your setting in the middle? Let me look at it now see
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.640]   Because because that was that
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.280]   Yeah, so you're right. All right. I take it back. I can't read them, but their headlines are all there. Okay, so
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.360]   I have two complaints about apple news. Wait, let me finish because I do have one other
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.320]   All right, and by the way, costco dad's still truncated, but just a little bit less
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.880]   Hot costco dad charms the internet after he's just added by a successful shopping tea
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.920]   Don't know what it is
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:08.520]   The problem is if I click on this apple news is going to take that as a signal that I like this story
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.560]   And it's going to give me more crap that I don't want to read
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.200]   So I'm not I can't even find out what the headline reads
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.760]   But the real complaint I have is that it's a walled garden
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.360]   There is no way to share into or out of this without sending a link to apple news
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.320]   We just not very helpful
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.920]   Yeah
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:32.200]   Is that is that just me? Am I doing that wrong also? But uh, I feel like if I use flip board
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.480]   I can share a link to the actual article if I use the web I can easily share a link to the actual article
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.680]   I use pin board. That's how we do our news gathering here
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.360]   Um, you know, I come from the old school radio days where you clip out pieces
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.200]   You know, peep pieces from the newspaper you put them in a folder and bring them to the show
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.040]   I still do that digitally, but I can't do it with apple news. So it's a non-starter
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   I would use a news reader rather than this
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.440]   Here's here are my complaints that um
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.760]   They do a pretty good job of showing us the new york times and roighters and the washing and post and the top stuff
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   And then you get the trending stories and it's the number one is almost always
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.520]   Fox news with some variation of uh headless corpse found in topless bar
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:22.840]   The current one i blocked fox news. I am and I meant that i blocked it and people magazine you can block sources
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.240]   Oh, well, i'm gonna do that because right right now it's prince charles warren mega mr
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:32.600]   Markle to avoid wearing tiara tiara as kate middleton rock the diamond headpiece
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.840]   Yes, see and if you read that
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.920]   You're gonna get a lot more
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.080]   Yeah, I don't like algorithmic news gathering. I kind of want to see it all
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.040]   I think one of the things I like about google news. It's not nearly as polished is actually pretty ugly
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.160]   But it doesn't do that it it surfaces on the front page your top five stories
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.760]   But if you go deeper they said specifically we we try not to do it algorithmically
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:04.200]   We give you all the different possible sources on that. I'm honestly i'm going back to rss
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.160]   But other complaints with the magazines in news plus
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.840]   I may be wrong about this, but I couldn't find a back issue
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.360]   You get you get that week's issue. Oh, that's not good
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.960]   Renee had the same problem. I've I have been able to access back up to a year's worth of
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.640]   Content, I think some of it depends on the magazine that you're looking at because
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.120]   Everything that I've that I've looked at gives me all the way back to march of 2018
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.200]   So i'm not sure why texture which is based on used to give you back issues
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.440]   Yeah, i'm not sure why some people aren't able to access back issues of stuff
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:43.160]   But that's that's not a that's not what everyone sees for some reason that's what you're saying in that
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.800]   Here's national geographic april march february january
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.880]   Looks like I can go pretty far back not as far back as in my grandma's basement
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.440]   But but I can go back to a year
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:00.680]   I'm looking at time march 2019 can't seem to do that. Oh, I'm gonna do you have the uh, the
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.480]   the oac cover of time there. I mean, let me let me find time
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:11.560]   Maybe that they made uh deals with individual magazines that are different
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   Well, you have a different cover than I do
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.040]   Oh, I see okay. Here's the new one
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.680]   All right, so then you click the
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.240]   Periodical
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.360]   Period then now I can go back to time. Yeah. Yeah. There's the aoc cover but going farther back than that
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.000]   Which is honestly, that's a pretty
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.160]   It's a pretty revealing thing that it's not as it's not as usual user friendly
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.120]   It's not intuitive, which I think that will get better
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.560]   Apples gonna, you know make this work a little bit better for us
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:49.800]   But there's been quite a few people who would say things like I don't I don't know where to find how do I favorite a magazine or
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.280]   Just like what you're saying. How do I find back issues?
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:58.600]   It's not intuitive right now and the app definitely needs a lot of work to make those things more
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.040]   Friendly for us as as readers and users, which I think apple will definitely work on throughout
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:12.280]   Then the months they're gonna figure out what works and what doesn't work and change that accordingly as best I could tell news pluses is really just a reskinned
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.840]   Texture and I think you'll for instance
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.480]   one of the things I really liked when they showed it off was
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.760]   At least in some
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:29.640]   Periodicals you're going to get a kind of apple news layout and others you're just going to get the old pdf layout and
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.760]   Right, I guess who was it that did
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   Vittichi did a
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:41.800]   Vittichi he looked at every single one of them and about half of them have have the new apple news
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:47.880]   Production and half of them don't so right now so if time I can scroll the magazine cover up
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.320]   By the way, they showed all the motion covers. I don't find very many of them
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:56.840]   You could scroll the cover up and see it a simple table of contents or scroll it left
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.640]   Oh, maybe I can't do that. I could do it on the iPad
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.200]   And I was getting the pdf version of the magazine, which is basically
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.720]   a let me see
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.640]   Yeah, it does that here with pc world
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.920]   Basically a scan of the magazine, you know, so I don't I don't know
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.000]   Leo before we move on out of this and this is not
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.920]   gonna make you any happier, but you can
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:26.760]   Send a link or share a link outside of apple news you just have to make an extra step by
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:32.520]   Click tapping into show in safari. Oh, you have to open safari and then you could right?
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.600]   I know that that still just
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:39.240]   Does it's not what it should be and what you would want it to be but just you know, it's there
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.720]   It's just not as convenient. No, I knew that there was an open in safari and of course once you're in safari
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:50.680]   You're in the real world again. I just I think really what i'm saying is it's a walled garden and apple really is
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.800]   To me this is damaging to the web. I made this argument you were there lorry on tuesday
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.080]   That this kind of walled garden of content is
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:02.120]   damaging to an open open web
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.920]   I don't know. Maybe again. I'm just an old timer
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.800]   No, I think you're right and the the difference between this and tapestry
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.240]   Maybe such a reskin tapestry with two new newspapers, but it's in a billion pockets y'all
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.720]   That's right
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.480]   And obviously that's what the magazines thought when they you know said all right we'll stay
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.720]   uh wall street journal
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:29.800]   Uh, is there in a some oddly limited form although there's some debate over how much of the journal you get
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:35.320]   Uh, but the new york times in the washington post are not there there as the regular news, but not part of news plus
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.640]   And la times is which is interesting. I think it's an opportunity
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.360]   I think this is what you're going to see as la time says well
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.400]   We would like to be seen as a national newspaper. Maybe this is a way
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.400]   To get that kind of national profile. Oh, smart news. Yeah, I think it's smart for them
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.480]   Yeah, I hope the san francisco chronicle does something like that. That would be great if they could
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.080]   Put me participants in the in the national news cycle like that
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:03.160]   I think anti-anachama the very good point which is that local papers are less than tights to be part of this because they give up so much
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.640]   Not merely revenue, but a customer information that it just doesn't make sense
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.520]   For them because they're local
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.640]   Uh to be in a national play like news plus
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.840]   You know what though if if there were more national news organizations that participated in the in the news app or in news plus
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.000]   I I think um
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.760]   We might be more inclined to spend money on those digital subscriptions for our local newspapers
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.800]   Um, like the second minnow bee has a has a paywall after you hit your five
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.840]   Five paywalls paywalls are not a good solution. Are they?
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:45.640]   No, well, it's it's it's I they need they're trying to figure out a way to make money in this new digital world
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:51.480]   So there's going to be a lot of hits and misses and a lot of kind of experiments with how to how to make money off of this stuff
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:58.520]   But if I'm only paying $10 a month for a bunch of international news or national news organizations
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:04.920]   I'm going to be much more inclined to spend that extra $10 a month for my local second run. Obie. Let's say or whatever your local
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.840]   um organization is just because you feel
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:13.240]   Well, this is my community and I want to read more about my community
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.920]   But I also want to continue to learn about everything that's going on in the rest of the country
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.640]   So it could be good. It could help sort of level the playing field and kind of
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.800]   um provide more opportunities for organizations to grow
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.360]   It's possible damn, you know the facebook tried to
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.480]   You know kind of position itself as the benefactor and savior of publishers clearly
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:41.640]   That was a double edged sword. Do not work out is that is this good for news? Is this good for?
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.520]   uh, journalism
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   I don't know. Uh, I I think we will find out in the future
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.680]   Uh, like I said earlier, my concern is that this could commodify news
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:59.400]   Uh, and we've seen that happen in the past with facebook and other outlets. Uh, it could be good
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.080]   uh, like
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.160]   I don't know that I'd be more inclined to spend money on local news if
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.920]   Uh more national news outlets were included in apple news
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:14.280]   But I do like the idea of elevating the profile of outlets like the leitimes and maybe this
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.440]   inferences go chronicle and offers
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   Um, I I don't know I
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.240]   I'm very conflicted. I don't know if I'll continue to spend money on apple news
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:30.680]   But every month a significant portion of my media diet and my budget goes to supporting news because it's incredibly important
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.560]   Now more than ever that we vote with our pockets and and say hey look
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.800]   News local and national is incredibly important
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.560]   vetted news reported news
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.400]   Yeah
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:52.360]   Um, I I think we can defer discussion of apple arcade and apple tv plus till they actually appear
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:57.720]   Because there's a lot of question mark so I you know a lot of things we don't know
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:04.840]   Uh, I think the only thing I might say about apple tv plus is while they've got all those people on those diocese and on those pedestals
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:10.760]   And it's pretty impressive. Uh, I think there's a lot of question about whether real whether creatives are going to want to go there
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.800]   uh, given apple's uh apparent interest in making it a family
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.880]   platform
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.760]   Um, you're not gonna see a breaking bad there. You're not gonna see
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:26.680]   Uh, true blood there. You're not gonna see a sopranos there. You're gonna see wholesome entertainment
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.640]   Right and they've been reports that the reason there's nothing to show. Yeah, this because
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:39.560]   Tim Cook and eddy q have been incredibly or someone has been intrusive and telling people what they can and can't do and you know if you
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:46.200]   HBO is smart. They hire really good people and they say okay, you're on your own. We're not gonna interfere
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:52.360]   Right and that's what hollywood got some while I hear absolutely creative celebrate hbo for that reason. I don't know if the new
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.080]   time Warner
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:01.160]   Will be the same in fact. I think hbo's might be different. Yeah, yeah, I think it's about to change which would be sad
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.720]   But goodness knows creatives have many places to go just because apple's waving a checkbook
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   Doesn't mean amazon and netflix aren't and uh, I think ultimately creatives are going to choose the place where they can create
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.240]   Their vision as best as they can
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:21.160]   Um couple more apple items then we'll get off this at this is not supposed to be the apple show
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.800]   Um airpower is dead
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.120]   Yeah
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   Wasn't that crazy
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:33.080]   I was actually in the middle of actually at the end of the the imore podcast show
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.160]   We were we were winding down and we were actually had been making jokes about
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:42.680]   You know will apple launch airpower while we're in the middle of our our podcast
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.800]   So I had twitter uh just in case, you know
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   There was a sudden announcement while we were talking and we were saying our goodbyes and sure enough that tech crunch article popped up
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   And you know we're all just like aha and I said wait wait wait
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.280]   And then we were just stunned the three of us just kind of said they're almost not talking for a second like
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.440]   What just happened?
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:11.480]   It's not I mean let's face it. This is not a major prod project product apple did announce it two years ago with the iphone 10
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:18.360]   Uh in fact when they announced it there was no, uh, there were no air pod wireless charging cases
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.080]   So we knew they'd have to do that too. They did do that
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   In fact that people are starting to get their new air pod twos already
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:33.720]   Uh, but apparently it was difficult to make the airpower. I fix it had an article that that guessed that the problem would be fcc approval
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.200]   Because apple you know most
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.400]   Uh
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.240]   Chee chargers wireless chargers have one or two coils
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:47.640]   Those coils are matched to a coil in the device and charge device via inductance
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.760]   Uh, but apples airpower wanted to have many coils up to 32
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:59.640]   Uh, so that you could put the phone anywhere any position or device any position or device on the pad would work
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.640]   Problem with that according to engineers is when you have multiple coils they interact
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:10.600]   You get standing waves and suddenly you get a lot of radio noise coming out of these things and so I fix it is it is
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.920]   Uh
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:17.160]   Guessing that the problem was you can get bad enough that can stop somebody's pacemaker
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:24.040]   So or short circuit a hearing aid. So, uh, I fix it as guessing that fcc approval apple was supposedly
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:31.000]   Manufacturing these they were already in manufacture, but getting fcc approval might have been right. So yeah, so if you take
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.360]   I fix its article at its word, which really does make a lot of sense then this idea that apple
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.400]   Um, you know, they failed to make it that's wrong. They actually did it. It's just that it's dangerous
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.280]   So it could kill you but it works
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.840]   Right
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.800]   According to groover, uh who heard from his little birdies six months ago
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:01.480]   Uh, there was a just a heated debate within the apple engineering community and half of them said it ain't they looked at it
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:05.240]   And they said it ain't gonna work and they're very smug right now because they were right
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:10.840]   You know, I don't this is one where i'm not gonna hit apple for this one at all because they tried something
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.400]   Yeah, and they didn't ship a bad product and they didn't ship something that didn't work or killed people
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.480]   Two thumbs up on that good on them. Maybe they shouldn't have announced it two years ago
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.000]   This is something I don't know that i've been noticing a lot in the tech community
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.480]   I raised this with the on windows weekly a lot of vaporware is back, baby
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:35.960]   Mm, google stadia. I mean not till the end of the year apple announced two products
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.760]   That won't be out till the end of the year. What another product won't be out till the summer
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.400]   Uh, they actually
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.600]   Google's known for announcing things and then never following yeah google you expect that but apple
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.840]   It's been pretty disciplined about not announcing stuff
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.560]   They iphone they announced the first iphone in january
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.360]   And it shipped in june, but that's because they had to get fcc approval and they didn't want anybody to know about it
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.880]   I understand that typically though apple is pretty good about this
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.160]   Why did they announce it so soon
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.560]   So yeah, especially
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.280]   It that's that is something that seems to really strange about that if they weren't 100
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.760]   Sure that this was going to happen. They could have just kept it to their to themselves
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.320]   Need to announce this at all
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.400]   especially when um
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:29.080]   If they if they would have eventually let let's say instead of it being canceled they announced it and it and it launched on friday
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:36.440]   At this point there's been so much hubbub about whether or not it will happen that a lot of people would have been disappointed in any way
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.560]   That it's just it's just another charging pad
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.440]   And sure it would have had great features, but because apple took nearly two years to put it out
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.960]   Everybody would have just kind of been like well who cares now?
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.320]   so
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.440]   You know
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:57.240]   Announcing it two years before it was going to be available if if it you know in in a different universe it did become available
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.760]   really was kind of
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:05.800]   Odd that they wanted to get everybody excited about this charging pad that they were making and then just not do it
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.560]   Instead of keeping it secret established that they were serious about wireless charging. So serious
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.960]   I think that's it. Yeah, they they announced it at the same time they took away the
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.280]   uh
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.240]   the
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:24.840]   Air earphone plug earphone. Yeah, so yeah, so they had to come up with an alternative solution to the
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.840]   To that plug and that was because it's because lost your power
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.720]   You lost your ability to both power and listen to music at the same time. Right. Yeah
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.120]   But you know, I think
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.000]   Well, the other thing that might have happened is in the in the two years or the year and a half that we were waiting for it
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.480]   all these cheap
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:52.280]   Discs came out and the the fields become commodified and one thing we know about apple is that they don't like to put out products that they don't make a lot of money
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.840]   So this before apple went wireless there were a lot of wireless
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.360]   Chargers
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.040]   Yeah, they were the last to the market with a charge wireless charging. So I don't know if that's changed dramatically
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.040]   But what but phillip you've been around you remember the early days of the computing industry where vaporware was very common
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.280]   Sure, and you did it for a couple of reasons one was to chase people out of the market
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:20.200]   Um, you know, let them know that you're going to come out with a killer product and it's going to come out in six months
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.280]   And it just kills the competition
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.000]   If you know if you're the right kind of company, uh, it's the kind of thing dale tried to do
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.080]   Uh, well, the famous one was Osborne computer. You probably go back that long. He asked warned himself
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.160]   Yeah, it became the term. That's what you say. They were Osborne
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:43.560]   At a body spawn it was selling a computer I wanted everybody's drooling over because it was
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.800]   So affordable at $2,000 and so light at 32 pounds
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.320]   And
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.960]   And a screen that was literally this big but you wanted it because it came with all that software
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.120]   And then he said and by the way in six months the Osborne tool will be out and sales just disappeared
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.360]   And the company literally went bankrupt. They went out of business. Yep. He was a knight. I liked Adam, but
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.560]   His name lives on unfortunately
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.520]   As a cautionary tale
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.920]   Um, there are no s
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.680]   Theranos if you watch the Theranos documentary yet, Dan
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:25.000]   I have and I read the book but uh, a red carriou is reporting when it was coming out. Yeah, me too
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.800]   Yeah, I haven't read carriou's book. We had him on uh
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.640]   Triangulation at my wife's reading it. She says she won't watch the documentary because she says I don't know what happens. Don't tell me
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.560]   I said
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:41.320]   It's uh, Alex Gibney did the documentary. He's the same guy. He's a famous super size guy. Yeah
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:47.880]   No, he did the Scientology document. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, so
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:55.000]   But what what this documentary does is show how the process of
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.200]   vaporware or taking the tech approach to problem solving uh has
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.120]   become a streamlined component of the industry. It's a really good
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.760]   I thought documentary
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.720]   Uh, it's called the inventor. It's all it's really about
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.440]   Um, not just really Theranos, but Elizabeth Holmes and and who she is and and what happened there
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.800]   And while it doesn't answer any questions, it's still fascinating
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.520]   Yeah, it is about wink
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:33.640]   That's true. She does how the tech industry has a particular approach to problem solving and that it might be permissive of vaporware
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:41.480]   And in this case vaporware on the scale that could harm human beings, but I mean we see this process through the entire industry
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.640]   Well lift just had a fantastic IPO
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.800]   And is now valued at 22 billion dollars even though
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.720]   It's never made any money. It's a big money loser as is uber
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.360]   And in both cases
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.920]   It's not clear how they could ever make money
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:05.960]   And yet the stock market has embraced these companies. This is this is silicon valley writ large
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.280]   lose money for years to build a customer base
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.640]   And figure you'll make it up in volume
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.760]   Yeah, that's yeah
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.400]   I mean that that's what amazon was, you know amazon kind of was the yeah, but they did it
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.600]   It showed every yeah, exactly they showed everybody that it can be done
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.320]   Which is why I think these companies are valued so high is that it can be done
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.400]   And so if you project into the future
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:37.160]   What your what your current user base is then you can kind of look at then say yeah, they're gonna make a lot of money at some point
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   We just got to figure out how
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.720]   I looked at that lift thing
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:48.920]   Wondering oh, you know, is there a buying opportunity should we be buying lift and I and and what it went up?
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.320]   23%
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.080]   in in a couple of hours and the next day I looked at
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:02.200]   Who who was made a billionaire who made a billion dollars plus on on that IPO?
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.400]   And there were five companies or five individual and I think there were investors who made more than a billion dollars
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.440]   That's the smart money
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:15.880]   They got their money and then with the IPO they're gonna sell it to the dumb money because you can make anybody
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.840]   Knows that the best way to profit from a pyramid scheme is to get in early
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.800]   I'm not saying this is a pyramid scheme by any means, but
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.560]   Yeah, it was it all VC firms that made made the big bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.760]   Not the drivers
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:40.440]   Yeah, well
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.840]   Congratulations
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.480]   You have to wonder though why people are buying the stock when there's such challenges in the future of ride sharing
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.720]   Uh, I think they're I think are they betting on uh autonomous?
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.080]   Vehicles becoming commonplace. I think they're betting on the gig economy is what they're calling it
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.480]   And that's a whole but there's a whole bunch of gig economies about the IPO, right?
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:09.880]   Gee, I had a list and now I've I know what I did with it. Um, but uh, I mean uber is coming up
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.760]   Oh, there's a bunch of them. I'm pinched. I think it's coming up, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh,
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.000]   Spotify did that already happen. Yeah, I think it did so
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.880]   But these are it's funny. It's I feel like we're going back in time and and worse
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.960]   We're going back in time and haven't learned
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:38.280]   The lessons of the previous iteration. Maybe that's just the way life is and when you get older you start to notice it
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.400]   I don't know
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.800]   Does it feel like the dot-com bus to you?
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.560]   I wouldn't I wouldn't say that only because
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.320]   This has been a 10 year bull market
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.160]   and against all sense
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.280]   It seems to be continuing
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.600]   I don't know
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.320]   It's above my pay scale. I don't know. Uh, yeah, I
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.240]   I'm you said it. Yeah, uh
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.800]   Finally one last apple story then i'm not going to mention the word apple again
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   Uh, but you have to have loved joanna stirns
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.240]   fantastic piece in the wall street journal
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.120]   Apple still hasn't fixed its macbook keyboard problem and of course
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:30.840]   Notice the problem is apparent in the headline in the article, but even better. She's put switches in
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.920]   So read with the ease on or off
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.040]   Read with the ours on or off because I guess her keyboard's malfunctioning
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:46.120]   Oh, maybe you'd like to read it with double ease and other problem people are having my wife has a double space bar
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.760]   On her macbook. How about double teas? You can have double ease and double teas
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.120]   And and on and on and on apple. I should turn all these off so I can read the damn thing
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.040]   Uh read with ease and ours, but do not read with double ease and double teas
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.280]   apple
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.160]   Told her because it's joanna stern running the wall street journal
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:14.360]   We're we're aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third generation butterfly keyboard
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.080]   And for that we are sorry
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.200]   The vast majority of mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the keyboard
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.320]   That's it
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.080]   Yeah, no, I mean a movie
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:35.560]   She made a movie after that a little video where she she actually puts on butterfly wings and a little butterfly antenna above her head
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.560]   I love joanna stern. She used to be regular in this show, but now she's too big time for us, but
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.680]   I think she's just great. We love you, jana. If you ever want to come back on twit, it's okay
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.920]   We would welcome you back
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.960]   Uh, they're doing great a great production job on the wall street journal. She's a worthy successor to wall moss berg
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   Let's let's put it put it that way
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.360]   Um, does apple have a problem with these keyboards
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:03.720]   Yeah, I think when the macbook pro with butterfly keyboard first came out in 2016. I think
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.760]   it immediately there were problems and
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:14.840]   I get that it's a small portion of people but there were enough people that it should have been recognized immediately and
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.240]   Something should have been done about it. And then sure they they put out the third generation
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.960]   um butterfly keyboard which had the little
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.160]   membrane that helped protect from from
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.680]   um dust and dirt getting in so it was supposed to improve it
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.000]   um, but
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.560]   there for apple to be so dismissive about so many people and again
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.880]   Obviously they they've got their numbers and it's a small portion of people
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:45.800]   But it's a large enough portion of people. I have it my macbook pro has double teas and double eyes
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.320]   really
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.520]   Yes, so there's two out of four of us. That's 50 of us that have problems with our macbook
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:58.600]   My wife it's three. Yeah, so it's big. It's big enough that there should be something done about it
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:04.040]   And there's certainly um like Joanna was saying there's a point at which they keep putting out
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.680]   More macbooks with this keyboard even though they know that we're all having
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.600]   There's a lot of us that are having problem with it
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.320]   They're not they're not just throwing it away and starting from scratch. They're trying to
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.640]   Incrementally fix it, but it's still a problem and at some point
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.880]   Nobody's gonna want to get a macbook pro or a macbook or a macbook air because they're not they're too worried about whether or not
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.520]   They're gonna have a keyboard that's got some kind of fault to it. So
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:37.720]   It should be fixed. Yeah, they really have lowered the quality of the macbook air
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:44.440]   My pet peeve is the magsafe, which was a really nice innovation
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.600]   Um, and they you know they have all these excuses for why they got rid of it
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.640]   Um, but the fact is it now it takes two hands to to push in the plug
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:14:01.000]   Uh, where it's used to be able to just snap it in and and it's you know, the risk of tripping over it is is increased
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.760]   It's a cheaper computer. It's kind of cheaper keys. It's got cheaper power plug
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.480]   Um, and it costs more
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.600]   Well, here's good news the mac pro is just around the corner and
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.240]   You can choose your own keyboard and still spend a lot of money. So
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.000]   So must they can't make a mechanical keyboard
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.920]   I and you know, I have to I broke my heart. I bought the I9 macbook pro with a touch bar. I hate the touch bar. It doesn't work
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.320]   Yeah, uh, I you I don't send me emails saying oh you should try a better touch tool
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.160]   That makes it somewhat more usable, but it's still a goofy waste of space
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.840]   Uh, I never had any problems with the keyboard, but I never liked using it
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.080]   So I gave it to my son and I'm buying a thinkpad
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:51.560]   Uh as much as I prefer macOS windows 10 isn't that bad and at least the keyboard works. Well
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.680]   It's fun. What you're saying is exactly what a lot of consumers are going to be going through
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:06.280]   I've if they haven't already is there's now three different types of of laptops from mac across three years that have

[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   You've done such great
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.520]   Coverage in the past. Are you going to get to do some election coverage? This cycle because your election coverage is great
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.520]   Well, that's nice of you to say in 2016
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.200]   tech republic which is also a part of cbsi we covered
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.480]   Not the horse race not the politics of who's up and who's down but the big data
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.360]   And what we discovered was this company called kambridge in a little bit. Yeah, uh, yeah
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.080]   Cruise campaign and I had these weird exchanges with this guy named
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.000]   Alexander nix in fact they invited me to their holiday party and what?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.640]   New york city opening party for their office. Yeah, uh in fact one of their
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.280]   PR people who was a former flag for them just emailed me his
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.120]   His experience working with them, but I knew them when they were on the cruise campaign
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.880]   And somebody said hey you should pay attention to this company. There's a little something fishy going on here. Wow
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.960]   And and we've been covering the the data involved
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.400]   with
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   Politics for a long time now. We'll continue to do that through
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.920]   2020 again not the partisan horse race
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:10.360]   But but the big data and the technology we're calling it election tech. It'll be on cbs news and cnet
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.760]   Uh for the next 18 months or so
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.840]   By the way
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.520]   Phillip I was going back to look at previous articles featuring this map
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.840]   And in 2016 you're on twit and the headline was apple is doomed
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.120]   So la plusa shan
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.160]   La plulumam shows
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.400]   I guess i'm just a broken record
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.040]   Uh, i'm sorry
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.520]   I love apple. I I really do I have i'm wearing an apple watch. I have an iphone. I'm using a surface studio. Oh, wait a minute
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:46.920]   Uh, actually this is making excellent ipad if anybody would just make a 30 inch ipad. I'd buy that
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.280]   Our show today brought to you by a fabulous
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.600]   my mattress
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.960]   Casper
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.360]   The sleep brand that continues to change the mattress world. They were the first
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.000]   to to realize
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.680]   That there was this huge inequity in mattress buying
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:10.920]   The mattress manufacturer would make it then sell it to a middleman a mattress store
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.680]   Where they would inflate the price by more than doubling it
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:22.280]   And and all for the privilege of lying on that mattress for five minutes in front of a sales person looking at you funny
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.640]   And decide because you need to lie on that mattress before you buy it
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.520]   Now perhaps that's true, but wouldn't it be better?
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.920]   To buy direct from the manufacturer at a fraction of the cost and then have a hundred nights to sleep on the mattress
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.960]   Before deciding that's the Casper
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.360]   Revolution
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.160]   They're cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.400]   Passing that savings on to you and they know that you want to try before you buy
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.560]   So you get free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:57.400]   You don't have to lie down in a showroom ever again. My goodness. These are nice mattresses. I love our caspers
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:02.120]   We had the original Casper mattress which combined multiple supportive memory phones
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.760]   for this kind of wild
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.680]   Sleep surface with but it has both just the right sink and the right bounces both soft and firm at the same time
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.440]   And it's breathable so you sleep cool and regulate your temperature throughout the night
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:20.120]   As you can see in the video it comes in a very compact box. That's a queen size. This is our guest room
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:27.160]   We just I just love these mattresses. Look at this and unlike any mattress I bought before there's no time to air them out
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.400]   They smell fresh as a daisy from the moment you open the box
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:37.000]   And are they comfy? You will love your Casper mattress buy it easily online
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:42.760]   Completely risk-free long lasting comfort and support we've had ours for several years now
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.600]   In fact, we've bought many more. I got one for my son when he went to college
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:52.760]   And uh, and it was so affordable after four years as you can leave it there. We'll get you a new one when you move into your apartment
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.720]   Casper knows

[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.000]   uh
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.560]   pled guilty to us wire fraud I aggravated identity theft and money laundering charges
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.360]   he had stolen
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.920]   122 million dollars from facebook and google between 2013 and 2015 how
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.720]   Sending him a bill
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.960]   He sent him a bill and they paid it. That's it. It's kind of genius
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.680]   Just you know what? I'm just gonna say I'm this company and I'm just gonna send you a bill and we'll see what happens
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:14.280]   Just he returned he returned $50 million
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:21.320]   But $73 million are still missing. They said he was a prolific and broke money launderer
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.000]   Well, someone else I know is a broke money
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.960]   prolific
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.240]   Did you see the article about that trumps cheating a golf?
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   Oh my god
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.600]   I don't play golf, but oh my god
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.720]   Anyway, uh, this guy is this guy's a punter compared to that uh scrolled cashway in cypress lithuania
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.360]   hungry slovakia and latvia
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:52.440]   Uh google says we recoup the funds were pleased this matter has resolved. He's facing up to 30 years in prison
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.160]   So it didn't work. Oh
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.040]   Um, he he faked that he was an existing company, right?
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:06.520]   And he said he was quanta quanta computer, which is a name. You know, it's a very well-known time Taiwanese manufacturing company
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.360]   He it turned out. They didn't have a registered trademark and latvia
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.080]   So he registered a company with the name quanta computer incorporated in latvia
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.960]   sent bills
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:23.480]   Apparently nobody matched up the pos and the bills into the accounting department. Just said
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.320]   must be quanta. Uh, we know that name and they they
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:34.120]   sent him checks what I wonder is if he had made up a name of a company and
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:40.280]   The exact same thing and the and you know facebook and google just paid the bills because they're you know
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.760]   They have such so many bills to pay. They weren't paying attention
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:48.040]   Maybe would he have just not even been in trouble for that because he didn't lie about
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:53.800]   Trouble. No, I think I think I think you can't just send broad. I think it's fraud. Anyway
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.360]   I don't know. I'm not a lawyer
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.440]   Why don't you try it laurie and see
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:04.120]   Just send a sick burn bill to google facebook and see what happens see what happens, right?
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.760]   Oh, I pay it that doesn't seem like that should be a little like incorporated. Yeah
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.640]   Just for services rendered
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.400]   Yeah
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.960]   You know if a company's big enough and they're not paying attention
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.640]   Maybe they'll just pay those bills and not even not advocating this. I'm just saying definitely not
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:28.680]   Definitely not. I I just thought it what I thought was so interesting was how he so easily managed to steal so much money
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.680]   and
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.920]   And I think partly because there were just people on the other end on the accounting end that were just writing the checks
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:42.760]   Writing the checks running the checks and not not you know kind of like putting those together for for however long
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   Was it two years? Is that what it was?
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.400]   There's a long time
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.400]   $122 million
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.800]   A lot of money. I caught someone hacking my mom's
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.240]   Checking account
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:01.000]   And I noticed when they took out nine thousand dollars in one day
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.160]   Uh, oh my goodness. Oh, and then so I went back
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.480]   I went to the bank and she said oh you better sit down because this went on a lot longer than this
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.880]   And we traced it back to
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:18.360]   Six months ago someone started making PayPal deposits little PayPal, you know, 47 cents 32 cents
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.800]   Which I didn't notice because I do that kind of thing all the time and I'm trying to transfer to a new bank
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.880]   And they send a couple of checks, you know
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.920]   But you know and they waited and waited and started just taking money out
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.400]   Um, wow, I got it all back
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.560]   Uh, but it it
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.160]   Um, it's a reminder that you really got to check your credit card statements
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.440]   Uh, and look for those little PayPal deposits. Yeah, because that's how they verify the account
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.120]   Yeah, they're
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.120]   Test it to see is there a real account here?
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.800]   Will deposit some money and take the same amount of money out and if that works then they'll step it up
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.040]   So, uh, dan Patterson, I figure of all the people you've got connections
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:07.080]   I don't know about that. Do you know gavin de becker? Do you know of of gavin de becker and what do you know of gavin de becker?
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.000]   I do not know gavin de becker. So this is the guy. He's been around for a long time
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.200]   He's writing in the daily beast. He is
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.160]   Jeff Bezos's security guy
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.760]   For 40 years. I've advised at risk public figures and government agencies on high stakes
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.840]   Security matters
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:34.600]   My careers included working with the cia fbi at the ragan white house counseling foreign l foran leaders advising on controversial
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.160]   murder cases. He's the guy who bezo sprotin when
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.280]   am I the publishers of the national enquirer
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.320]   Said started publishing texts from bezos to his girlfriend
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.120]   Sexts I should say
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.960]   Am I by the way, this is an opinion piece
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:58.280]   But uh, so we're gonna have to consider it that uh break it down
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.000]   am I the national acquirer publishers
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.080]   We're very quick to tell de becker in not quite in so many words, but apply to de becker
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.800]   that they got the texts
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.440]   from bezos's
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.160]   girlfriend laren sanchez's estranged brother
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.360]   who who didn't like bezos and
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:28.440]   de becker says am I I practically pinned a kick me sign on michael sanchez. Well, this is the guy
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.960]   but
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.200]   De becker's dug a little deeper
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:40.840]   And bezos now believes in de becker uh confirms that in fact it was saudi arabia
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   That sold this information to am I
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:52.200]   And that fact saudi arabia bezos says has been inside his phone and bugging him for a long time
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:29:02.440]   Now I guess you know, I mean we I don't know why anybody would make that up
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:09.080]   Um, I think de becker. I don't know how credible de becker is. I've heard his name for a long long time
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.680]   um
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.000]   He's he's considered a very serious private eye. Yeah
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.480]   You know, he's not lying about his record. I thought that the distinction was between the the
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:26.360]   texts that the brother
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.520]   may have had access to
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.440]   uh because
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.160]   I don't know, but then
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.480]   How did someone get ahold of the pictures that are in
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.400]   um
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.520]   The iPhones and that that's not something
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:48.920]   A nation's iPhone. That's a nays state. Yes. Is that confirmed? It was an iPhone. They never mentioned the phone model
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.120]   Well, it wasn't a fire phone. I can promise
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.760]   Maybe it was
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:01.160]   I've seen references to an iPhone, but I but they weren't uh, it wasn't the guy himself saying it so I don't know for sure
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.600]   Yeah, the key there is what you said leo
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.040]   That it was a nation state or allegedly a nation state actor and whether these allegations are true or not
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.240]   We do know that Saudi Arabia has played an increasing rule
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:20.200]   Uh in silicon valley and we know that nation states are often threat actors
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:25.720]   and that the targets are often asynchronous at least in terms of
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:31.800]   Their ability to counter these strikes. Uh, we see the rise of iran as well
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:36.120]   uh, israel for sure is a powerful nation state actor
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.120]   China
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:47.160]   and uh russia are all acting on the national or international stage and their targets can be anyone raising raising
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.720]   ranging from basos to
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:57.000]   Other large nation states or other large companies cyber war global cyber war is simply a fact of life now
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:04.600]   Uh, de becker says he's handed over the evidence, uh to law enforcement. He said this is my last public statement on the matter
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:10.200]   Um, he says we're not clear to what degree if any am I was aware of what was going on
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:15.000]   Um, but it was interesting that they so quickly threw sanchez under the bus
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.760]   And of course you may remember a new york times said that the soutis had a embedded
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.800]   Uh spy, I guess inside twitter twitter fired that person
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.520]   um
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.920]   That you know the soutis have targeted
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.000]   Um
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.200]   Bezos has already been reported by cnn and bloomberg and the daily beast so it's not this is not new
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:45.480]   Uh, in fact, there have been public calls for boycotts against amazon and the it's soutis subsidiary suke.com
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.520]   Um
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.800]   And it's interesting. I don't I mean I don't know what to say about it. I bring it up
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.800]   Uh only because I think we're going to hear more and more stories of nation states getting involved in
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.200]   politics
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:06.120]   Yeah, the motivation here would have been that the washington post has been going after the murder of kashoggi
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.640]   Uh full body work for the washington post. Yeah
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:17.400]   So bay and base of sones it so that he would be the target. Yeah. Thank you for yeah for connecting those
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.960]   thoughts for us
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.040]   speaking of hacking asus
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.080]   is being uh
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.160]   accused of
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:32.920]   Using having its updater used to embed malware on asus computers
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:39.640]   This uh first came from kaspersky labs the russian security researcher later confirmed
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:44.280]   uh for mother board by uh, I think semantic
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.680]   the
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:53.400]   Story is kind of interesting because even though thousands of computers tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of computers
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:59.000]   asus computers had this malware installed signed certificate
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.520]   Uh from asus using the asus updater
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:06.760]   But only 600 machine on 600 machines was it activated
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:11.880]   And it was activated if you look if you look at the malware was activated by mac address
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.160]   So the perpetrators of this and I don't think it was asus
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:20.920]   I think it's much more likely that asus had an advanced persistent threat a hacker inside their network
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.880]   That uh was able to sneak this into a payload of an update
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.000]   Which is why asus signed it and pushed it
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.560]   But where did they get the mac addresses and why were those mac addresses particularly
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.960]   Chosen I think is very interesting. I think this is pretty clearly another
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:46.360]   nation state and I proposed when steve gibson talked about this on security now at an example scenario
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.960]   let's say
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.240]   North korea learned that the uh, uh, uh
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.840]   Korean embassy in washington had just taken an order of
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.960]   I don't know 600 asus computers
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:06.120]   It wouldn't be too hard to figure out what those mac addresses are and then try to infect them to put malware on there
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.040]   Or the israeli government took 600 asus computers and
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.720]   the souties
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.680]   Perhaps there you could think of a lot of scenarios where
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:21.240]   You would spread malware everywhere with the aim of merely targeting a handful of machines
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:27.560]   Any thoughts about this or is this just just yet another one to put in the folder?
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:35.080]   I think that would the reason would I go ahead and then the fear that that comes to me when I read something like this is how
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.680]   dangerous it is that um the supply chain is kind of a
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:48.120]   Ground zero for what becomes a future attack a lot of times when we hear about viruses or um cyber attacks
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.720]   A lot of us um in the tech world that we can say to you
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:59.640]   Don't freak out. The only way this will happen is if somebody has access to your physical computer and nobody's has that access
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:05.960]   You're fine and then when you when you read something like this you're kind of like oh wait that this could happen
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.000]   It in the supply chain that could then eventually
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.880]   If effect us in the future even though
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.880]   Nobody's you know sneaking into our house and turning on our
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.480]   You know cameras at at night or something like that. This is
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:25.160]   Something that could infect us um in our hardware, which could then eventually affect us in our software
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:32.200]   And the I mean the scariest thing and I don't really know what to think about it is the allegation that
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.240]   Huawei is that how you say it? Yeah, Huawei? Yeah Huawei
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:42.920]   Uh, which provides the servers that are the backbone for a lot of countries internet
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   That they've got uh spy chips in there already and that you know, that's the reason why the us has banned them and the rest
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.320]   They have the canadians arrest the c
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.560]   F. Oh, um
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.560]   I have no idea whether it's possible and I don't even know how you
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:02.520]   Make sure how would you test?
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.760]   Uh one of these servers to find out if it was spying on you know was was
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.240]   Was looking at every piece of traffic that went through it. How would you find out?
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.480]   Dan you were going to say something?
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.280]   Well, I I think you know to laurie's point in the supply chain the reason you
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:31.160]   An attack like this exists is to obfuscate the intended target and you know, we as consumers might not be as at risk from threat actors
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360]   performing behaviors like this
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.600]   but certainly those in
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.920]   government and
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.680]   Contractors with the government are particularly vulnerable and you know scattering this
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.960]   across the supply chain is
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.520]   Has a potential for
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:55.000]   A lot of distributed access by what you said there initially leo in the abt
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.640]   It's interesting because you may remember when sea cleaner
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:06.120]   Which is a very popular although I think of dubious value cleanup tool that pc users use
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.040]   uh
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:13.320]   In 2017 was delivering malware to customers via a signed software update
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.200]   But to connect the dots in a weird way. This is from the motherboard article
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.800]   Uh that it may have been the same attackers
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:27.800]   Behind the sea cleaner attacks and it is thought that asus. This is according
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:34.200]   uh to one security researcher was one of the primary targets of the sea cleaner attack
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.840]   So this is this is really important to understand
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.600]   how uh
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.440]   Persistent
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:50.920]   And clever as nation state attackers can be and how long term their goals can be if they
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.720]   perpetrated a malware
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:58.360]   Payload in 2017 with the intent of getting into asus
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.800]   So that they could then later after sitting on asus's network for a while and figuring things out
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:10.600]   Baa, you know target 600 amir 600 asus computers two years later
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.360]   That's a pretty this is a tough thing to be
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.480]   This is going to be harder and harder and we're going to see a lot more about this now
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.840]   There is some question about what is asus's culpability
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.520]   If anything asus was slow to tell people about this
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.280]   Uh, they were warned about it in january. They took their time
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:35.800]   I understand, you know, sometimes it's embarrassing to talk about this stuff. Sometimes you want to research it before you talk about it
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.880]   Uh, they took a long
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.280]   Time to tell their customers about it
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.640]   That's got a change and that's one thing I like about gdpr
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:51.080]   Is uh time, you know short time frames for revealing breaches and things like that. You can't keep this stuff secret in the eu
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.000]   Um, we're we're to see a lot more of this and then of course, uh, when you talk about supply chain larry
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]   That brings up the famous bloomberg super micro story, which is never proven
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.640]   Uh, uh, a supply chain attack hardware supply chain attack on super micros computers. I think there's
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.560]   I think there's I always look to you dan. I don't know why it's not like you're a hacker
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.160]   But I feel like you have you have you have your feelers in this community
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.000]   I feel like this is just known that the supply chain is vulnerable
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:27.560]   Yeah, the supply chain I mean it's it is my community and as much as it's my beat. Yes security is but um
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:34.680]   I I mean the supply chain is vulnerable and we will continue to become more vulnerable as it becomes more diverse
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.240]   And especially as I I feel like a broken record every time I talk about the internet of things
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.760]   But this is the next coming hardware, uh thing and edge computing and as we have
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.360]   uh
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:54.840]   Millions or billions of more devices come online and how many of them have a default password of password or admin or made by some
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:02.600]   Strange vendor somewhere. We can just assume that a certain percentage of the connected device ecosystem
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:09.560]   uh ranging from an iot device to a mobile device to a computer to who knows what is going to be vulnerable
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.720]   Yeah
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:18.280]   Well, just I'll get a cautionary tale and if you have an asus computer asus is sending out firmware fixes patches or something
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.280]   I'm not sure what but they are fixing this
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:26.200]   Um, and that's a good thing if you missed any of our programs this week on twit you missed them
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:31.160]   You missed nothing because we have no promo this week is that right?
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.680]   You're just gonna have to guess
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.040]   Normally we have a promo
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.360]   uh our show
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.280]   I should have asked ahead of time before I started that tease our show today brought to you by
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.200]   Hot wasabi wasabi is hot cloud storage good to remember right wasabi
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.480]   That's that green ball in the sushi platter. You don't pop in your mouth
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:59.560]   But on the other hand wasabi is the hot cloud storage alternative you really do want to consider
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:05.240]   I know when people are moving to the cloud of course and everybody's moving to the cloud in one way or another fact
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.320]   the uh estimate is that there'll be 163 zettabytes
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.080]   in the cloud by 2025 in the next five years
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.000]   That's that's 163 followed by 21 zeros
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.800]   That's a lot of data
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.320]   There are a lot of companies vying for your data the big three of course
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.200]   But I want to tell you I want you to add a fourth to your shopping list wasabi
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.720]   Wasabi was founded by jeff flowers and david friend two guys. I've known for a long long time
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.840]   They found a carbonite and the thing that they discovered when they in fact patented
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:46.760]   When they created carbonite was a revolutionary process that lays data on discs sequentially as opposed to in blocks
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:53.480]   However, everybody else does it that results in storage that's 80 cheaper and 600 faster
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.200]   than amazon's s3
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.280]   And that means wasabi can do it better for less for you wasabi
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:08.680]   Is going to provide cloud storage that is in most cases more secure than your on premises storage
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160]   That's faster
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.840]   It's very simple. There's just one tier of service and unlike the other guys free unlimited egress
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.760]   So you don't have to budget for well, how much download are they going to want?
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   No, you don't have to worry about it
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:29.960]   And and and I have to say it is really secure hipa finra and cjis compliant. That's important
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.160]   And if you want to move a petabyte of data up to the cloud you can do that with the wasabi ball
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.040]   It's awesome. He's they sent it to your premises. You copy your data over you send it back now
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:45.560]   You're in the cloud wasabi's awesome. I understand you've not heard of them before unless you've been listening to our show
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.280]   But I want you to at least check them out w as abi.com
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.440]   Add them to your shopping list check them out. There's one more feature
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.320]   I really love the ability to say some data is immutable. That's so important. That means
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:06.840]   No fumble fingered employee. No ransomware can modify that cloud data. It's immutable. It's safe
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:14.520]   Enterprise grade cloud storage a fifth the price of traditional vendors up to six times faster
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.960]   No hidden fees for egress. Oh one more thing
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.520]   The api is the same as amazon's s3. So you already know how to use it
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.280]   It's basically plug compatible with s3 for a lot less
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.280]   Go to wasabi.com and use the offer code twit for a month of unlimited storage just to try it
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:40.600]   Copy everything up there wasabi.com is the offer code twit or contact sales to find out more about wasabi
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.640]   Bring that to your boss say boss
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:50.360]   You never heard of him. I know but this company's 80 percent cheaper six times faster. They've got immutable storage
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.840]   It's s3 compatible
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.640]   We got to at least try them out wasabi
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.760]   Dot com
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:05.880]   Well, I don't know whether to say this is the end of the world as we know it or just the beginning of the end of the world as we know
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.800]   I'll let you be the judge. The EU has
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.840]   approved the
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:15.960]   Copyright directive. We were all afraid they would approve
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.920]   including article
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.480]   11 and 13 now cast as article 17. So they might might fool you
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:30.600]   But a very scary bill now it won't be law. It's a directive not a law. It won't be law till all of the
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.560]   countries in the EU
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:40.280]   Incorporated into their own legal code, but that will happen quickly. I think in some countries like france who really wanted this
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.480]   article 11
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.480]   Is the snippet article
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.320]   And this is something that was tried both in spain and germany with not the best effect
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:58.040]   They don't like it that google publishes snippets of content they being axles springer and the other publishers in the EU
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.920]   That google publishes snippets of their content and search results. They say knock it off
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:08.520]   Uh, so that's article 11. I'm much more worried about article 13 now 17
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.400]   because that says that
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.440]   Sites like facebook twitter
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:19.960]   YouTube have to proactively monitor for copyright violations
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.000]   Proactively that means before the content is posted
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.560]   They have to make sure that the copyright is unencumbered
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:32.920]   and
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:37.720]   Honestly, this is very scary to companies like mine where almost everything we do
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.400]   Including playing those apple clips is uh comment on
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.520]   copyrighted material. There is no
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.120]   Allowance for for fair use in the new law
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.040]   Five million petitioners, you know, five million people signed petitions against it
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.240]   There were hundreds of thousands of protesters on the streets of europe last weekend
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.760]   But it passed
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.640]   So now what am I am I over am I overly worried?
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:11.400]   Well, it's things like this
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.040]   that caused
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:14.840]   Brexit
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.640]   I mean they the the british felt like decisions were being made in Brussels. Oh interesting
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   They had no control over
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.880]   And uh, this this that's what this feels like to us, right?
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:31.640]   I mean the eff points out that maybe courts will uh will modify or change it
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:37.160]   That countries may modify before they make it their law one hopes that some sanity will prevail
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:42.440]   But there will be at least a few countries france for one in the EU that will adopt the most
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.920]   draconian interpretation of this new copyright directive
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:55.800]   When when the internet exists like start sort of started when the world wide web became more publicly
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:00.520]   Available to all of us. I remember thinking this is the wild west right now
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.760]   There's no regulations. You can do what you want. You can start a website with any name
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.480]   There's nobody out there who's regulating it or owning it and making you license or buy anything
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.760]   And I knew then and this was a long time ago
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:17.960]   That this would not last and frankly, it's lasted a lot longer than I thought it would
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.200]   it's it's like when when um broadcasting radio
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.240]   First started you you could just as long as you had something that could handle a channel
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.560]   You could make your own radio station. There was nobody
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:32.680]   Telling you that you had to buy or rent or license
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:35.720]   You know wh yz or something like that
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:41.160]   It was just open to everyone and then regulations started coming into place people started owning the airwaves
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.360]   And I think that's what we're seeing now with the internet. This is just one step in that direction
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.520]   You arguing this this is a good thing?
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.760]   No, absolutely not
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.000]   And I wish this wasn't happening
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.520]   But I I knew from the beginning that it was never going to be as perfect as what we've had all along
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.600]   Not that what we have as perfect, but the openness that we've had all along that
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.760]   I'm not surprised at all that this is a step down that path where
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.480]   We're not going to be able to just
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:15.640]   By the domain www.loryiserockstar.com and then you know have a blog on it
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.720]   That's not the happy part. Sorry
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.600]   The future of internet is splinter net splinter net tell me about that
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.120]   Those splintered internet, right? Yeah
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:33.480]   Different regulations for different territories, right? But ultimately doesn't the lowest common denominator win? I mean
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.040]   Well china is a splinter to internet
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:44.120]   They they block all kind of news all kinds of yeah, we don't have to block the rest of the world. Yeah. Yeah
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.600]   But I'm kind of surprised that the internet companies
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.920]   I mean obviously there's there's two parties here. There's the internet companies that
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:59.480]   That like that they get to do it and then if if they do something wrong they can then correct it
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:05.400]   And the copyright holders who say no, no, no, you can't put it up and if you put it up
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:13.000]   You're liable. I'm surprised that the internet companies didn't have enough power politically financially the number of pull
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.720]   To to get their way on this it does seem that that's the trend in europe, right? I mean the
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:24.840]   Google hates this snippet this as this jeff uses the german term, which i'm not going to attempt
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.440]   Like tung jig trekters. I did attempt it by mistake
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.400]   but
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.560]   It's it was kind of a failure in spain
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.160]   And it's it's not been a success in germany, but it doesn't it's not doesn't seem to stop them and the reason
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.040]   It's one thing for china to have its own internet. It's another thing
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:50.200]   Well for us for instance, are we going to have to block our podcast from listeners in the eu because we could be liable to prosecution
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.600]   because we comment
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:50:00.760]   Everything we do every one of these stories i'm pulling up an article from an a newspaper or magazine that we're referring to that's what we do that's commentary
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.200]   Do I have to block the podcast from the eu?
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:11.720]   I want to have to go to jail in the eu of course if it's a france the food will be pretty good. Yeah
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:20.120]   No, it's it's terrible and unfortunate and I think you were saying the beginning of the end
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.920]   Um, I I think that's very true. It's a state of innocence. I guess and yeah put it. Yeah
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:33.720]   Yeah, it's the end of the the wild west of the internet that we've been so lucky to have this whole time and it to me
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:40.440]   It was inevitable that it was going to happen and and I you know, I hoped that that you know sort of commerce
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:48.200]   um at would out win would win out and that you know, we could just continue to have it be open because so many companies can easily make
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:54.760]   A living off of it, you know you being able to make a living off of just talking about news that pops up is
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:03.400]   Amazing and wonderful and the fact that we're able to do something like that is so incredible and only exist because the internet has been so open and
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.680]   Those doors shuttering is really disappointing and I think
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:11.080]   I don't know it's it's very possible that this is just one
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:17.800]   That we're going to see this happen in more in more companies in more countries if if they succeed
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:24.280]   A little closer to home. We've got Elizabeth Warren talking about breaking up facebook and google
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.760]   and and
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.600]   You know, you got to say wait a minute those they've created so much value
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.080]   um, you know that that's a
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.760]   Yeah, I don't know billions trillions of dollars of value created
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:44.840]   And you're going to target it and break it up. I think though that that answers your question earlier about why the big boys aren't fighting
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.920]   This as hard as they could
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.080]   Uh, they're already
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:55.560]   Running a rear guard action. Aren't they mark Zuckerberg in the washington post the internet needs new rules
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:01.560]   Yeah, this is the last guy you would say expect to be saying oh, we need more regulation
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:05.160]   Uh, but I think it's a defensive action. It's like, um
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:12.200]   What do they call that when the firefighters start a burn going in the other direction to keep the town from burning up
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.920]   It's a backfire
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.080]   Uh
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.520]   You know, dandy have a thought on the uh articles 11 and 17
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:27.080]   Um, well, I mean, I think we are headed towards a splinter net and I certainly thank you with mr
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:28.280]   zuckerberg's
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:33.240]   Um commentary the other day that this is what the entire tech industry in the united states is doing
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:40.600]   Yeah trying to defend itself by getting ahead of itself. Uh, you know, uh, we've spoken with warren's camp
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:47.960]   Uh and interestingly, although he's not in the field yet, uh john k six camp has some fairly sophisticated thoughts about regulation
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:53.240]   Um, and so it'll be interesting to see the the rhetoric evolve over the next year and a half
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.640]   During that campaign cycle. I don't know that we're going to see
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:05.880]   Uh, federal regulation anytime soon, but I think that we can absolutely expect state regulation, especially from california
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.800]   Yeah, we already have state of new york a very extreme california privacy bill
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:13.480]   Uh passed into law it won't take effect for a couple of years, but
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:18.840]   Uh, I think what's happening at this point is people like zucker hoping to fair a federal regulation
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:23.560]   Which as I remember ted cruz or is it no marco rubeo's already proposed
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:32.920]   Yeah, rubeo has proposed that you know, um, it for those of you who would like a fairly good example of what regulation might look like
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:38.120]   in a form that still allows uh tech innovation to happen at rapid scale
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:44.920]   Uh, but protects consumers. I would highly recommend reading uh, robert maknames book zucked
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:51.880]   It's not just a takedown of zuckerberg. Uh, it's and it's not just a biography of makname
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:54:00.440]   It's a really good examination of what consumer privacy regulation might look like and what the posture of consumers
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.680]   might want to have
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:05.960]   going forward, you know instead of looking at data as this kind of
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.840]   amorphous, uh and
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.440]   And uh abstract thing that different companies own
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.640]   Uh thinking about data a lot like your health care records
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:23.000]   I think that we could see regulation look similar or take similar shape to what uh makname has proposed
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.600]   Yeah, I don't I think I would love to hear in fact we should get roger on our show
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.960]   Uh, I would love to hear what he thinks about yeah, he's a character. I actually went to school with him. He is a character
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.880]   Uh, uh, I would love to know what he thinks about marx
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.120]   Op-ed on the washington post calling for more regulation
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.280]   Because it's really a jiu jitsu move. I mean he's basically saying
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:53.000]   Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power. We facebook has too much power for speech frankly, I agree
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:59.720]   I've come to believe we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:06.440]   So we're creating an independent body so people can appeal our decisions and working with governments including french officials
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.800]   Ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.880]   I think mark would love to pass the burden on to
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.280]   Government
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.720]   You decide we don't want we don't have to decide
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:27.560]   Didn't didn't google this week also announced that they were creating some kind of council that was going to um advise them
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.480]   I was about ai but but it yes similar thing. They're looking for a fig leaf
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.400]   Um, this this council for google was going to meet once a month
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:45.560]   And and that would be enough to make sure that that ai didn't infringe. Thank goodness. That's all it takes. That's awesome
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.600]   Yeah, that's once a month
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.360]   Yeah, yeah
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.440]   All right, we've been arguing the trolley problem for 25 years and have a
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:01.080]   A conclusion. I don't know if once a month's gonna do it. What's the trolley problem? Oh, you know that self-driving car
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.640]   conundrum
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.560]   Where the the car I've you know, it's been stated in a lot of ways
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:13.640]   But but essentially the car is forced to make an ethical decision between let's use the most
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:20.200]   dramatic case killing its occupants or running over a grandma and two young children
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:21.720]   and
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.720]   What should the car do?
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:27.800]   And you know some say well should always protect the occupants. Yes, but those young children
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.200]   Have a life ahead of them and you're an old man driving the car. We should kill you
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:38.280]   And and there and and there that's at least one meeting right there
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:45.320]   That's a month's shot right there on that subject alone
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.040]   um
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.440]   Let's take one final break
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:54.360]   And then we'll we'll run through a bunch of smaller stories to wrap this
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.920]   Thing up our show today brought to you. Oh, I love where's my quip? Do I have a quip here?
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.840]   Oh, I have it at home my quip toothbrush
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.880]   I'm about to go on a vacation in Hawaii and I will pack the quip the quip electric toothbrush
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.480]   Is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the american dental association?
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:14.360]   It was designed to make brushing your teeth easier
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:22.600]   More enjoyable and more affordable created by deaths loved by people it uses gentle sonic vibrations
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:30.520]   Dentists recommend people brush too hard. You don't want a brush that's too hard. This is gentle on sensitive gums
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:33.320]   Many electric toothbrushes are too abrasive
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.600]   Bad for your teeth not the quip. It's built in two-minute timer pulses every 30 seconds
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.520]   So you know when to switch sides make sure you clean your whole mouth evenly
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.560]   90% of us don't do that
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:47.320]   shocking
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:50.520]   I do i've got the quip to remind me and I love the cover
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:58.040]   Which can either work as a stand or I it has a little strip on the back that you could adhere it to your mirror or and then that way
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.840]   It's uh, I never forget to brush. It's right there staring me in the face
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.040]   And also declutters notice. There's no charger
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:11.560]   One of the things I love about the quip and the reason it's up the best travel toothbrush ever it doesn't have a charger
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:18.600]   It has a triple a battery inside when it dies. You don't charge it. You just get another battery in fact
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:25.960]   I love this brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just five dollars
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:31.160]   Friendly reminder when it's time for a refresh to put a new head on it. Stay committed to your all health
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:38.840]   Quip is one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the ADA. They have thousands of verified five star reviews add my name to that list
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:46.760]   Backed by over 20,000 dental professionals and here's the best part if you've looked at electric toothbrushes at over a hundred dollars quip starts
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.920]   at just 25 dollars
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:55.960]   It's so affordable. We actually got an extra quip with a couple of extra heads for sleepovers because you know what teenage boys when they come for sleepovers
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:59.080]   I've learned this never bring a toothbrush, right?
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.240]   never
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:05.400]   Too bad aton. We've got your toothbrush your name's on it too bad
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:13.160]   I love quip and you will too if you go to get quip g-e-t-q-u-i-p.com/twit
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:19.480]   Your first refill pack is free when you purchase any quip electric toothbrush. We at least I have his and hers
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:24.520]   That we she has silver and I have copper I think so that we know who's who's
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:36.680]   Get your first refill pack free at get quip.com/twit. Please use that URL so they know you heard it here get quip.com/twit
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:40.120]   It's the bane of teenage boys everywhere
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:46.920]   Actually the quits the qu- they like the quip toothpaste have used that it's really tasty. They like that
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:51.880]   Amazon is working on a free fire tv news app
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:59.640]   Nothing more to say here nothing to see here just thought I'd mention it
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:07.480]   Actually, this is the hot thing. I saw that is it mclatchy maridith no scripts
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.280]   advertising heavily for
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.280]   a news app
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:16.200]   Is this the hot new freshness? I don't know why it's very odd
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:22.440]   Doesn't seem like everybody everybody gets their own news app. Is that the idea? Yeah, you get a news app and you get a the
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:27.960]   Scripts one. I was curious because they advertise it in msmbc and they say something like
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:35.240]   I want to hear from both sides and I thought oh, okay, who's this who's behind this but scripts is pretty
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.160]   You know reasonable news operations. So I thought oh, that's good
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:44.520]   And here's one you and I and every tech journalist will celebrate
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:48.680]   Chris capisella who's chief of marketing
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.280]   at
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:53.080]   Microsoft and a and a good friend of the network by the way
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:59.160]   We have them on every year on windows weekly has sent a memo to all microsoft employees leaked out to the verge
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:02.600]   Saying do not
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:07.640]   Do an april fools joke this year. Hi everyone Chris writes. It's that time of year when tech companies
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:11.800]   Try to show their creativity with april fools day stunts
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.160]   Sometimes the outcomes are amusing sometimes they're not
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:23.720]   Either way data tells us these stunts have limited positive impact and can actually result in unwanted news cycles
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:28.840]   I'm asking all teams at microsoft not to do any public facing april fools day stunts
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.720]   Now I want to say a memo from sundur pachay to the google folks no april fools
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.560]   It's too late right monday's april fools. I bet you google has 15 pranks already planned
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:48.680]   Wasn't gmail april fools. Yeah gmail last year they had despicable me characters in my mail. I don't want that
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.800]   I'm against unwanted news cycles. I'm I agree
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.000]   no unwanted news cycles
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.680]   But every one of us has to
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.920]   Wade through stories just a reminder monday is april fools
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:07.960]   And you're going to read stuff that's not true
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:13.240]   And how many people have gotten bit by reprinting or republishing or talking about
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:16.680]   I
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:24.600]   Yeah, we should all just take tomorrow off tomorrow is going to be a personal day. We're just take everyone's just going to take it off
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:27.240]   Well, i've got jury duty tomorrow, you do
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.520]   And I hope the judge says april fools go home phillip
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:37.400]   Wouldn't that be funny you were talking about elizabeth warren and I think her misguided and obviously
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.120]   you know
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.120]   attention seeking
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:48.520]   Recommendation of break up the big tech giants. I have to say I do I am pleased to see her come out in support of
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.360]   A national right to repair law for farm equipment
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.120]   Right to repair even apple. This was a fascinating story
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.800]   apple
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.280]   Just in case these right to repair because apple's been fighting it state by state
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.520]   Just in case it should happen that a national right to repair
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:15.320]   Bill comes out apple apparently has a like emergency sealed plan
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.560]   For what to do in case right to repair becomes the law
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.200]   They've they've apparently allocated
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.600]   resources
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.680]   overall of this
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:34.200]   Anybody here on the panel want to stand up for the right to not repair
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:38.600]   No, but i think we would
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:45.800]   Would apple would change all the screws and take the glue out of the battery no they actually
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:51.000]   In fact, I thought it would let me see if I could find this story
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.520]   Did we have it in the rundown or did I just read it and not bookmark it? I probably should have bookmarked it
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:01.640]   They apparently have budgeted a certain like 20 million dollars. They have
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:04.360]   Uh, yeah, here it is
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.680]   This is actually from november
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:11.480]   Nope, that's not it. That's not it. I searched for plan b and I found a different plan b
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:15.400]   I'll find
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:20.920]   But with the problems right now apple's fighting at state by state because they want all repairs to go to the apple store
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.960]   Or to apple directly. They don't want third party repairs of iPhones
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.160]   They have their some merit in that they one of the things they say as well
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:32.680]   If you if you let a third party repair your iphone, we can't guarantee its security afterwards
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:35.560]   Sure, but then by by
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:38.760]   The way and I think apple is doing
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:44.280]   They're doing some really good things toward helping people who do uh want to repair their device
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:49.720]   But if you start saying things like you can't repair your device, we're not going to give you the schematics for how to repair your device
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.800]   We're going to make the screws
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:58.680]   You know proprietary what you're doing is this is my phone that I paid for and you are acting like it's your phone
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:03.160]   You're you're treating it like it's something that i've rented from you instead of something that i've purchased myself
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:06.600]   I should have the right to make it less secure
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.240]   That is my right as the owner of this phone to make those decisions
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:14.200]   Um, that's why I think the right to repair is a really great
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:20.520]   A really great thing because we need to be able to write right now, especially with with iphones and apple devices
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.760]   They're completely unrepairable
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:27.240]   Without going directly to apple or by using these really expensive things
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:33.400]   They're difficult to figure out you have to know what you're doing. I fix it as a great organization that helps us learn these things
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.640]   but those kinds of um
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:40.920]   User guides don't exist from the company themselves and so we do risk potentially ruining
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:46.200]   Our devices by just trying to do something as simple as fixing a cracked screen that shouldn't be the case
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.200]   I should have the right to get a screen fixed without worrying about
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:56.760]   Um, you know with or just to be able to do it at all. Here's the story motherboard once again. They're good boy
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:02.520]   Internal documents show apple's capable of implementing right to repair legislation
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:07.000]   They prepared a report in april 2018 a year ago
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:11.960]   Uh that would make it possible to buy apple genuine parts
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:14.920]   to certify independent repairs
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:19.880]   And place no restrictions on the type of repairs independent companies are allowed to do
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.880]   Um
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:25.640]   Kyle wienes that I fix it who is a big right to repair advocate in fact
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:32.920]   He uh has the site right to repair.org says this looks to me like a framework for complying with right to repair legislation
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:40.600]   Right now they're only offering it to a few mega chains. It seems clear to me. It would be totally possible to comply with right to repair
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:45.000]   My reading is it's a plan b just in case
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.920]   You get pregnant. Yeah, just in case
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:53.400]   Uh interestingly warren did not mention apple but did mention
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:07:01.000]   John dear and the and farm equipment, which is a big issue and i'm sure an issue in the heartland where obviously
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.480]   A lot of voters live
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.360]   Where the where the hippie farmers live the hippie farmers
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:11.560]   chal sanderg says facebook's looking at ways to restrict access to facebook live
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:17.960]   They don't want everybody to be able to do it after the christ church shooting in the video that was posted there
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:24.840]   My question on that is my question to that is what do they mean by restricting who can
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:31.080]   Yes, do how who can use how are they going to determine that is and they did there's a little comment on that
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:36.280]   it's based on um whether or not they're complying with community standards and things like that but that
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.760]   You know bad things are going to show up on facebook live
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:46.600]   Just they're just going to show up that way and good people are going to not be able to post things on facebook live
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:49.800]   You know, there's it's how are they going to do it?

[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:23.960]   Who made the you know the the swatting call to police in 2017. Oh, yeah, that caused a death
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:30.280]   And two suicides afterwards. Oh, no, really? I didn't read about that. Yeah, the the
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:34.840]   Knees of the guy and then it was in the people read more of that story. It came up
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:38.920]   It was the shooting death of an instant canons this resident who just was at the same address
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.720]   Tyler bares who's what was his uh?
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:47.720]   Twitter handle something like uh mr. Swatter or something uh 20 years in jail
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360]   Just a little word of warning
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:52.440]   uh 20 years in jail
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.000]   He had done it
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:02.120]   Many times. Yeah, New Hampshire, Nevada, Massachusetts, Illinois, Utah, Virginia all over the country
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.520]   It is and the writer of that article says at the end
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:10.120]   He mentions that it happened to him. He got swatted. Oh, yeah, they got
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.280]   We've been swatted. I don't know if it was by yeah by the celebrity swatter
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.280]   but
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:20.040]   We've been swatted fortunately the pedal of the police are not aggressive
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.320]   In there they came by
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:28.680]   They said you got any bombs in there somebody says he's gonna shoot y'all anything going on in there?
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:33.640]   No, they did go down. They went to the SWAT team was it a SWAT team? Oh, it was a couple of
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.800]   It was detectives, right a couple of cops
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.760]   Um, they don't have we don't have a SWAT team here, but they and they did send down
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.120]   Took a while they sent down. I think sander of feller services go for a dog to sniff the basement
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.120]   This is in the old place
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:52.760]   Uh, and that was actually when we went hired an armed guard and had training on evacuations
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:55.400]   I'll never forget the training. Do you remember this where they said?
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.160]   Now the key is if you've got an active shooter in your building you want to wait till he reloads then run
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:06.680]   Ouch, you don't remember that?
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:11.560]   Yeah, wait till you hear him reloading then get the hell out
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:20.040]   You don't run towards him and take his gun away? No, although that is a tragic story. We should actually mention that
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.800]   uh one of the victims of the christ church
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:25.640]   um

[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:54.280]   Actually, I really enjoyed my jury duty. I was on a federal case
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.920]   It was remember do you remember those
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:00.840]   uh really awful uh date line to catch a predator
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:03.400]   shows
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.480]   Where they would set up a fake
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:08.360]   house with a
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.320]   teenage under age girl in it except there was an adult pretending to be an underage girl trying to lure
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:15.960]   predators
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.120]   And they had one of those houses was in padeluma and I was on the trial for that case
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:25.560]   We get through the first it was fun. I was taking notes. You know, they said turn, you know, they would judge is very serious
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.360]   I'm going through the whole prosecution's case paying attention
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:34.680]   prosecution whaps up the judge says go home. This was entrapment. There's no case here at all
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:38.440]   But I want to vote no
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:41.000]   That's it
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000]   I've been on a bunch of juries. I love it
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.280]   I love it
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:49.000]   And it honestly if people don't do jury duty then the only people who you'll get when you get
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.360]   When you go to court is somebody doesn't want you know doesn't have the wherewithal to get off the jury duty
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.880]   That's not good
