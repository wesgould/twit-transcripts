[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   And today we have a nice big studio audience.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.560]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   This is the second of our barbecue.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.480]   And I think we're going to do more of these.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.160]   It's a lot of fun to have big studio audience from all over.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.400]   There's a fellow from Ireland.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560]   Welcome.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.120]   Fellow from Edmonton.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   Welcome, good to have you.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.400]   And the rest of them from all over the US, Los Angeles.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.560]   Great to have you here.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   Our panel today includes, to my left, Mark
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.760]   Million of CNN.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.440]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.000]   The LA Times.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   Good to see you.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.160]   Good to see you.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.040]   Thanks for coming.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   Appreciate it.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.560]   It's been fun.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.160]   John C. Devorek.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.840]   Welcome to you.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.720]   Hello, John.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   And next to John, Mr. Patrick Norton, my urcht
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   while Buddy from the screen savers, famous for his sledgehammer.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.400]   Look at that.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.320]   Look at you with a fancy rip hammer.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   Isn't that a nice hammer?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.440]   That's a California framing hammer.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.160]   This guy here in the front row knows the guy who designed this.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.920]   He says it's a racing hammer.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.080]   What does that mean?
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.560]   Well, if you can race chainsaws, why can't you race hammers?
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.000]   Anyway, feel that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.240]   So Patrick is famous for his sledgehammer.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's nicely balanced, isn't it?
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.840]   I have a feeling that when you find me slumped over my computer
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.640]   with a hammer protruding from my head, it will be that one.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   At least it'll be a quality hammer.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.840]   It'll be a quality way to go.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   Maxwell's silver hammer.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.640]   So Patrick is famous for using a sledgehammer on computers
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.200]   he doesn't like.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.520]   So I thought, just in case anything at this point
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   angers you or raises your eye or you'll have that--
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   That's good.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.800]   Just broke the sat.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.840]   Take him to the studio now.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   That's good.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.360]   Oh, that's good, he says.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   Is that nice?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   Yeah, put it down before you hurt somebody.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   This is from Douglas makes these high-end tool maker.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.680]   That's very nice, thank you.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.160]   I'm excited.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   Oh, you want to see a shot of it?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.240]   Look at that.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.720]   It feels like it's got a longer handle than normal.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   I don't know why that means.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   It's a framing hammer.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.800]   It's had really long handles.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.920]   So you can get a lot of momentum going there?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   All right.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.240]   16 penny nails suck.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.600]   Do people still use nails?
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.920]   Yes.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.280]   Yes, they have to.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.160]   Anyway, the big story today--
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   As opposed to what, Leo?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.320]   I don't know, fasteners.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.080]   Glue.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.600]   Glue.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   What they're using.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.280]   It seems so primitive that the way we join two pieces of wood
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.160]   is by driving a steel spike in home building is primitive.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.000]   I guess it's a very basic fundamental thing.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.480]   And it employs people.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.800]   So I think we should start with this carrier IQ story
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.760]   because I need some clarification.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.720]   I need to understand.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   What's going on?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.000]   Carrier IQ to kind of fill you in.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   There's a guy who does a security--
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.440]   Actually, I think he's an IT guy named Trevor Eckhart.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640]   He's got a blog.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.080]   And he noticed a lot of outbound traffic on his company's land.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.360]   He said, "This is odd.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.920]   Where is all this traffic coming from?"
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.880]   He looked into it and it was coming from employees' smartphones.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.200]   He looked into it a little bit further and found that there was
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   a program on many of these smartphones called Carrier IQ
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   that was phoning home.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   Now, when he first announced this a couple of weeks ago,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   Carrier IQ said, "No, no.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   In fact, the carrier said Sprint in 18.2.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   We're using it said, "No, no, no.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   This is software we put on the phones.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   We monitor the network.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   We monitor usage anonymously.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   It helps us design better phones, make our network--"
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   And that actually makes sense.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   You want to tailor your network for where the usage is.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   So they said it's helpful for that to improve network and
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   handset performance.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Now, Eckhart did some more research, looked at some debugging
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   software, and according to the video that he posted this week,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   all activity on the phone is recorded and sent back to Carrier
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   IQ, including keystrokes and actions.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   Let's pause for a moment because at this point,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   this story hits the web.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   The web goes berserk.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   Berserk.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Senators, Al Franken.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   Other Senators are--
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   Has demanded a report.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   Right.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Because it's literally, you know, it's one, it's, okay,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I like to tease Android owners because it's easy.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   But it's pretty much on all Android phones.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   It's on BlackBerry phones and people freak out.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   If he's built into the iPhone software too for us,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   which Apple was like, "We've disabled an iPhone 5,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   we'll be clearing other of us at our product software later."
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   So, you know, it is a commonly used tool pretty much by everybody.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   So the $64,000 question, which you were bringing up before,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   is, did Trevor make a mistake using debugging software?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   Or--
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   Which one?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   Security researcher said he did.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   He said, "No, no, no, it's scanned.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   It says it's scanned.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   The keystrokes is not sending them back.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   That's the--
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   He's misunderstanding what the log is saying.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   Right.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   Or the log captures every single character you enter on your phone,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   which is a little more terrifying.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Including during SSL sessions where you're typing your bank pass,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   where the dude captures that, and Trevor says, sends it back.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Now, we asked Trevor to join us.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   He did not respond, so he doesn't have--
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   We don't have a way of asking him this.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   But there is quite a bit of dissent over it.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   Lance Hulinoff writing in Mashable says,
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   "Carrier IQ is misunderstood, not evil.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Carrier IQ themselves say, 'We don't do this.'"
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   And in fact, even if--
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   No matter what they say, why would any company
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   collect every keystroke from every phone that it's running on?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   It'd be insane.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   What would you do with all that?
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   Analyze it.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   But not steal passwords.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   Look for spelling.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Well, no, everybody's laughing.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   But look for spelling mistakes, because it's--
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   Apple's--
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   Apple's really--
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   No, you're right.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   --in order to improve your predictions.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   They're like, "Google does."
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   Yeah, I mean, we stopped supporting Carrier IQ with iOS 5,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   and most of our product will remove it completely
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   in a future software update.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   It doesn't matter if they wanted to or not.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   They're going to do it now because Apple's playing a game
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   to try to keep ahead of Android.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   We're the good software, not that open source stuff.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   But it says, "With any diagnostic data sent to Apple,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   customers must actively opt in and share this information.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   If they do, the data is sent.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   It is in an anonymous and encrypted form.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   It does not include any personal information."
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   So the other thing we don't know about Carrier IQ
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   and certainly Carrier IQ is not going to be answering
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   a lot right now is, although actually they did do a--
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   They said they're not collecting this stuff.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   Right.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   But that doesn't mean somebody else isn't collecting this stuff.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   Well, it does raise the issue.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   If it's stored in a log on the phone,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   then a bad guy who gets your phone might be able to find all that stuff.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   The bad guy gets my phone and actually manages to crack
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   the security on my iPhone before he erases it.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   Not everybody puts security on their phone.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   I understand that.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   But everybody should put security on the phone.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   And everyone backed up this week?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   Who's backed up today?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Oh, you're--
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   Okay.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   Who's backed up this week?
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Who's backed up this month?
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   Everybody who hasn't backed up, you have something to do
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   on Sunday night when you get home.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Because one of you is going to lose a hard drive in tomorrow.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   It's your PSA announcement.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Sounds like your PSA announcement.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   Yeah, really.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Lance's position is that, look, all computers have diagnostic software running on them.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   Well, I think the problem was that this was just sloppily coded diagnostics,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   whereas they didn't necessarily need to log every keystroke into the log.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   Right.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   They could--
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   If they're doing that, we're not sure they're doing that.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   Well, they're logging it locally onto the phone,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   but they're not necessarily sending it to the network.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   They're probably not.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   Well, this is all-- this is a supposition that's apparently people have not ignored the fact
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   that Gina Smith, who's got a new-- she's got her-- she's-- I don't know what she's like,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   the pied piper.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   She's got all these people working for her, and I'm going to help her under a new thing.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   But does she uncovered the fact that she recalled a press release from these guys that was put
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   up with the Nielsen company, and that was taken down, and she called one of her friends at Nielsen
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   and had to resend these old press releases.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   And that's where the IQ guys apparently show all the functionality.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   They brag about the fact that they do collect every single keystroke.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   They brag about the fact that they can map what you're doing and what you're thinking
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   and how you're thinking.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   Wow.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   And this was produced as a press release within the last two years about what they're up to completely,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   and it's just now getting picked up.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   These guys, this is a-- it turns out exactly what they're doing may, in fact, be an incredible violation
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   of US law.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   It would be illegal if you--
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   Totally.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   If you don't opt in.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   There's still some issue here, because a lot of the stuff they're doing apparently is pretty
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   sketchy.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   Now, that said, as somebody else pointed out to me, what is the difference between this
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   and what Echelon is doing, or what they're doing in that big AT&T building where they're
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   basically taking everything, the US government, the National Security Agency for one, is looking
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   at every single moment that you're on the phone looking for keywords, and it's basically
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   what we're being spied upon in every which way.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   What?
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   Well, one, if you're transmitting information on the internet, it's unencrypted.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   It's public anyway.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   It's the back of a postcard.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   You can make privacy assumptions, but they're really pathetic assumptions that you were wrong
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   about.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   So-- but two, the idea that your carrier has the ability to look on my phone and see the
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   pictures I took last night, that scares the hell out of people, because they assume they're
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   phone and its contents is private, even though if you get pulled over doing something stupid.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   I assume that my land line is private.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   You're so cute.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   I assume my land line is private.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   Well--
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   You need to play around with some phone and something.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   I think-- I think-- we all-- do we all understand anybody who listens to this show would
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   understand that, for instance, you're internet service provider-- I mean, people worry about
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Facebook and Google.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   Your internet service provider sees everything you're doing.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   Your internet--
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   Your internet provider can see everything.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   One of my favorite lines, one of the guys who works with--
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And that cell phone's even worse, because, you know, I mean, your carrier, your cell phone
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   carrier is the person who-- is your internet service provider on your cell phone.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   So they can see everything you're doing, plus the cell phone itself reports back with your
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   location.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   A lot of information.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   Who is surprised that this stuff is being sent back?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   Isn't it a little naive to assume that it's-- you know, I mean, this is-- if you don't-- if you
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   want to be private, don't carry a cell phone, right?
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   Could you pick up the hammer, please?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   Oh, no.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   It's OK.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Just pick up the hammer, please.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   OK.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Now, is this a hammer for driving nails and a principal tool used in construction and home repair?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   Yes.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Or is this a murderous weapon used almost weekly to destroy human lives and create suffering?
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   OK.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   Because carrier--
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   HTC says, HTC says, hey, yeah, we use carrier IQ.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   Somebody has a problem.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   We tell them to hit this button.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   If they opt to hit this button, it sends us information.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   We can fix their phone.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   And that's why they're logging keystrokes.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Because it's a diagnostics program that responds to, you know, star 2-2 or whatever.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   It's looking for a string of characters that you hit on the keyboard and then it activates.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   By the way, that's a dragon slayer.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   Just I just wanted you to know.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   How much is the--
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   [SINGING]
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   I'd like to know how much are the bandwidth that these crazy things are chewing up, doing all this
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   calling home.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.600]   And by the way, there's a company up in Canada called SpyCop, who is one of the earliest key
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   logger breakers.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   I mean, they essentially have software that allows you to find spyware, not the Trojan
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.880]   horse generator and stuff, but stuff where somebody goes on your machine and sticks a
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   key logger on it.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.280]   Are chatt-- something in the chat room is saying, well, the reason this is a problem is because
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   carrier IQ is not your phone company.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   I don't see why this would be any worse.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.960]   It's not your phone company.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.040]   So we assumed the phone company knew everything, but now the third party also knows everything.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.720]   I guess that makes it marginally worse.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.800]   But carrier IQ also says, we're not collecting the information.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.680]   This is a tool that we sell other people play with the tool.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.160]   What they do with the hammer, what they do with the tool may be up to what settings they
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.800]   use, how they employ it, what the end user opts in on.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.640]   And the truth is, this is going to take a lot of work to try to figure out what everybody's
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.040]   doing with this and if anybody's doing anything with this.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.880]   I think jail time should be involved.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   Really?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.160]   Oh, we did such a great job challenging the people that took out the economy in Wall
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   Street.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.520]   Let's go after a small company that's screwing around with cell phones.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   Why not?
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.000]   I don't think we have the full story yet.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   That's what I'd like.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   My understanding is--
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   It's not going to be good.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   It's not going to be pretty.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's going to be worse than they're not sending the information over the way.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Well, apparently that's--
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.640]   That's just sloppy and they're storing weight too much information.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.000]   You have a positive attitude.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I like that.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.480]   He's here to counterbalance you on the other side of the table.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.000]   I thought I was being chipper.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.800]   So well, all right.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.600]   What do you think is going to happen?
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   Carrier IQ says we collect data for performance information which we sell back to the companies
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.880]   that subscribe to our service.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.400]   We don't care what SMS message you send.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.560]   Do you think that they are gathering other data on our use?
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   I don't know.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.720]   There's going to be a Senate hearing.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.160]   Frank, it'll be in that committee because it's one of the ones he's in.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.640]   And there's going to be a lot of blather and we'll find out it.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.560]   I kind of agreed with the other side of the table that the--
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.200]   There's more to the story than we know.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   The story we don't know.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   I think what we know we know which is what minor.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   There is, of course, a class action wiretap suit saying they violated federal wiretap laws.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:55.640]   The suit is against Carrier IQ, HTC, and Samsung.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   Could be-- you might want to get in on that.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   You probably get a check for $10.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   $10.43.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   This is free money.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.120]   140 million phones and tablets have this stuff on them.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.480]   Yeah, that's actually a funny point of the $10 because there's been some research that,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.360]   you know, into the idea of actively selling your personal information, you know, because
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   companies--
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   Well, they're going to collect it.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   Let's do a fair trade.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   Don't just take it.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   The problem with that is that--
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   That's what we do with Facebook, right?
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   Right.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   Really?
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   Well, maybe.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   I get a free service.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   I know they're getting some information.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   That's fair.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   So the phone should be free.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.320]   The people vastly overestimate how much their personal information is worth.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   How much is it really worth?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   A couple of bucks.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   Probably a few dollars.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   Depends on whether--
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.960]   If you're a stock market trader, this worth quite a bit of money.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   I mean, it's worth something to Facebook.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.440]   Facebook's evaluation--
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.880]   By the way, an aggregate though.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   An aggregate.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   With millions and millions.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.240]   Not the end of-- yeah, they have 800 million users.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.640]   They're worth, apparently, according to the rumor that they're going to have an IPO at
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.120]   $10 billion that will value them at $100 billion.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.400]   That's a pretty valuable company based on collecting people's data smog.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   So I mean, it's worth something, but you're right in aggregate.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.080]   So actually, if you do the math, if they're worth $100 billion and they have 800 million
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.320]   users, reach worth about $58.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   Sounds about right.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   It could be worth a lot more than that.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   I mean, I was just listening on the way up, as a matter of fact.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.920]   If some guy, discussing-- he was one of the guys in the news of the world who just was
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   in front of a hearing.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.760]   And he says, everybody tapped the phones.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.400]   He says, it was worth a fortune.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   You hear all these messages.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.640]   You find out what you're doing.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   You could blackmail people.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   This is the murder.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.680]   You could do all these different things.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.360]   And it was like, that information was quite valuable if you're a celebrity at some level
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   and you can collect this information.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.640]   So I don't believe that only an aggregate is this stuff worth anything.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.760]   And why did Carrier ID record these keystrokes if it did?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.800]   And again, I think there's some question.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.960]   But if it did, why did it record it to this log?
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.000]   That's not something you would normally do as a record.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.080]   Well, Carrier-- in the Verge article, Carrier IQ basically says, it's not our log file.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.720]   It's the manufacturer's log file or it's the carrier's log file.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.520]   Do we put stuff in there absolutely but only after the carrier or the manufacturer?
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   Aha.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   What is it about?
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   The sergeant's Schultz that said this?
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   I know nothing.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   All right.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   Well, it's a great story.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.920]   What happened to being benign?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.960]   Now you brought fascism into it.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   That's it.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960]   By the way of bad '60s comments.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   That's actually quite good '60s comments.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.520]   Actually, I agree with you.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.240]   Holognes Heroes?
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   Come on.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   I can't laugh at those.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   I don't want to--
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.880]   Lawrence Marks, one of the greatest TV writers in history.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   Who?
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   That's--
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   Lawrence Marks.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   Lawrence Marks.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   The guy who wrote that.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.880]   And I wrote most of the good episodes.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.880]   They could wind four stories.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   How did this happen?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.520]   Four stories together like nobody else.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   What?
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.520]   Holognes Heroes.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   You ever watched Holognes Heroes?
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.400]   Apparently, I didn't pay attention.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.600]   It's a structural-- it's amazing structural product.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.600]   You're kidding.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   No.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   I'm kidding.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.200]   There's actually an interesting article in The New York Times last Sunday about the
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.400]   death of television comedy that nothing new is happening.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   Because guys like you--
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.960]   Since Sherwood Schwartz.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   Or what's his name?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   Sergeant Schul--
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   Sergeant Schul--
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   The guy who created the--
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   The wrote these.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   Lawrence Marks.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   Lawrence Marks.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.000]   We're going to take a break because this is just--
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   AT&T.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.320]   We'll talk of AT&T mobile.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.400]   Sopa on the rope.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.600]   But now the movie industry says, "Not a worry about it.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   We'll fix it.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   We'll make it better.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   We'll bring it back."
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   Kindle Fire.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Doing well.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   Spotify.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   Big announcement.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.400]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.800]   So we got the one topic.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   And we're already going to go break?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   That's a pretty big topic.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.320]   We spent 15 minutes on it.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.640]   You want to talk more about this?
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   No, I'm done.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   You want to do something?
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.000]   Enjoy-- I wanted to give you some time to enjoy your red vines.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.520]   Are those with these yarn?
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   I told you.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   There's two types of people.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   There's a red vine.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.920]   Twizzlers, yeah.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.440]   Oh, are those-- I don't know.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   They might be twizzlers.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.000]   These are red vines.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   You can tell.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.080]   You can tell because the other kind, no offense to the twizzlers
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.520]   or eaters, are terrible.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   They're waxy.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Red vines are waxy.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Mm-mm.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.040]   Twizzlers are inedible.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.200]   Red vines are waxy.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.800]   Trit-lizz are inedible.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.280]   You should have left it at the--
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.120]   That's the--
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   Hogan's heroes.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   It's actually gone--
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   it's gotten worse.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   I didn't think it could.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.520]   Would you like to borrow the hammer?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.320]   Let's talk a little bit about go to my PC.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.480]   The holidays are here bad.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.880]   Weathers, sick days, travel.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.320]   You may not be in the office very much.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.160]   I think I'm only in the office a couple of weeks in December.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.760]   It doesn't mean you can't get work done.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   Go to my PC.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.320]   It lets you use your iPad to access your office computer.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.520]   So here's what you do before you--
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   What size pockets do you have?
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   I'm like Captain Kangaroo.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   I got all sorts of stuff in here.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   I got hammers.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.080]   I got iPads.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.800]   Before you go away for the break, before you get sick for the holidays, before you decide
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   that you just don't want to work anymore, install GoToMyPC from Citrix on your office
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   computer.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.640]   You can actually do it free for 30 days at gotomyPC.com.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.640]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   There it is.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.640]   TWIT for the promo code.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.240]   Now, you got it on your PC.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   Now, hit the road.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.400]   You can use the free iPad app.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   You can use any computer you log into.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.920]   Securely connect to your office computer Mac or PC anywhere you're online.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.320]   You can run any program, access any network resource, send and receive any email.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.040]   It's just like your work, even on the iPad.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.160]   It's so weird and wacky to be using a desktop computer on your iPad, but it works great.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.040]   Your office computer, just a click away.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.160]   You don't have to work, but at least you know if you need to, you can.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.000]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   No.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Click the orange button.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.920]   The Try It Free button, and then, enter TWIT in the offer code and you can try it free
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.120]   for 30 days.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   Big fan.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   It wouldn't go anywhere without installing.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.280]   Go to my PC first.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.200]   We are going somewhere, by the way, tomorrow.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.800]   I'm heading to France, Eileen Rivera.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   The producer of this show is already there.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   Sarah Lane is already there.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.360]   We are getting ready for the web conference.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.560]   You can find out more on our blog.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   TWIT in Paris.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   Wednesday, December 7th.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   We begin our broadcast today.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.480]   Now she's giving it in Paris time at 12.15, which is 3.15 in the morning, California
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.760]   time, 6.15 East Coast time.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.520]   Early in the morning on Wednesday, tune in.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.640]   We'll probably chop this up and put it on specials, maybe even rerun it.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   We're going to be interviewing Kevin Rose on the main stage.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.040]   Sarah and I will be doing that.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.000]   Then more big names.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.600]   People like Dave Moran, Eric Schmidt, Marissa.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   What's her name?
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   What's her name?
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   You know.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   And that other guy.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.560]   What's his name?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.440]   You can watch the stream at lowweb.net.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.640]   They have a stream of their speakers and then they will pull them into our...
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.880]   I want to see the studio.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   I haven't seen this yet.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   Our lowweb studio.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.280]   They're building it right there.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.520]   Oh, no, no.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   Go to my screen.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   My screen.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.520]   Oh, you got it?
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   There you go.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.520]   See?
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.080]   These are lowweb IBM studio.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.920]   They're tilting up the walls even as we speak.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   That should be a lot of fun.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   I can't wait.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   It's another size of this thing.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   I know.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   It's huge.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   This is life.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   No, this is life.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.200]   Do you have like this French Union workers are going to walk out on you?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.840]   It'll be done in August, just in time.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:42.520]   So join us as we talk to some of the biggest names in technology, all Wednesday, Thursday
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   and Friday morning.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.840]   Do you want to do some big to do like this at the CES show, Big Giant Studio?
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   We won't do it something like this.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   We have a skyboose.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.760]   Why is this so hard to give you all this room?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.560]   It's Le Week.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   They're French.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   They do it up.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.400]   You know, Wednesday I'm meeting President Sarkozy.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.800]   We're going to, we're having a reception at the palace.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.600]   You're going to get to meet his wife?
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.360]   I hope, I hope Carla's there.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   She's some.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.960]   You did some kind of internet summit there.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.000]   We were going to do, I was going to do the E8 summit and I couldn't make it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.920]   We sent Jeff Jarvis in my place.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.160]   I don't hope that the President Sarkozy doesn't remember that.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.640]   Jeff, because Jeff was, Jeff really was confrontational.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.080]   He said, "You're ruining the internet."
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.720]   And he said, "You're ruining the internet."
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.120]   He did, he said that.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.800]   So anyway, that'll be interesting.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.720]   So that's coming up next week.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.480]   I won't be here, but Tom Merritt will be holding down the fort.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.520]   And then I, next, what are we doing for Twit?
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   Is Tom going to do Twit?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   I guess next Sunday Tom Merritt will host Twit.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.360]   But obviously I'll be using Go to my PC to stay in touch.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   AT&T, T-Mobile, AT&T says the FCC document on the T-Mobile by Lax, all credibility.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.720]   They're fighting hard to keep this alive, even though they've already taken a $4 billion
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   charge.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.280]   Is there any hope for the AT&T T-Mobile merger at all?
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.800]   Is it over?
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   I hope so.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   I think they still have a shot.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   Really?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   I do too.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   They can redesign it and...
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.000]   No, they're already playing this game where, well, like, what if we do this?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   What if we do that?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   What if it's a joint venture?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.960]   What if the thing was established from the beginning with this thesis?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.720]   We're not going to make this deal happen.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   So here's what we'll do.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.160]   We'll ask for too much and then we'll have a fallback position where we can give away
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   a bunch of stuff and then they'll tell you that's...
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   That's how you negotiate.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   That's how you do it.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.720]   It's quite possible that they're going to be still doing this deal soon.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   Well, the latest option that The New York Times reported is that they would sell off
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.960]   some of T-Mobile subscribers to leap wireless and turn them into the new T-Mobile, kind of
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.000]   boost them up a bit and then take T-Mobile Spectrum.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.240]   Yeah, which would have been planned in advance.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.280]   They come out smelling like a rose and saving money.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.560]   That's usually what happens to these things, right?
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.960]   The government objects, the company's regroup and they come back with something the government
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   can agree to.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.000]   Yeah, but this is also...
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I...
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.320]   Now, see, I don't know why...
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.960]   If you're sitting in the audience watching the show, you would need to listen to it.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   Like, I want a ball game.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   This is like baseball game.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   I'm like, "What did John say?
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   Let me listen."
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   I mean, I'm not a...
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.640]   Despite the fact that I've been giving the money ever since I bought an iPhone, I'm not
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   a big AT&T fan.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   Who is?
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   AT&T.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   Yeah, I don't think anybody is.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.320]   AT&T's done a spectacular job of slowly reassembling the monopoly that was broken up
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   you know, a thousand years ago.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   They've done...
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   Right.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   They've done...
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.720]   They have technical engineer or like engineering...
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.880]   I can't remember the name of the people that generated the report, but a few years ago,
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:46.520]   when everybody got upset, that you're paying for X megabits per second of download capacity
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.760]   and they were like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.600]   no, we do that like a webpage at a time, but if you really want full speed, this is what
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.280]   it would cost you per month.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.800]   And it was like $400 versus like $50 for DSL connectivity.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.880]   It's like, "Wait, we're selling you like a webpage at a time.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   We don't want you to actually do large downloads.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.080]   We're not selling you 24-hour access to this internet speed."
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.880]   AT&T's so fundamentally slimy in Washington.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.600]   AT&T and Verizon spent over $11 million lobbying on the Hill.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.360]   And lo and behold, the FCC decides not to regulate wireless internet, you know?
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   Right.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.000]   AT&T has been the highest spender of lobbying of any business in the country for at least
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   the last year.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.880]   Because they think their interests are in the, you know, that's not because they want what
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.720]   they want and what they want is higher profits.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.040]   And they don't really care about what goes down.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.760]   And T-Mobile, I mean, I'm not arguing that T-Mobile doesn't have issues, but T-Mobile has
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.400]   forced other carriers to step up their game.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.840]   And it's messy.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.480]   That's why I always like having this scrappy little underdog, the AMD, who's keeping intel
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.680]   on us, or the T-Mobile who's keeping AT&T on us.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:04.240]   Now what's now, you're going to have to explain this to me, Verizon is buying billions of dollars
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.200]   worth of spectrum from Comcast's Time Warner, unused spectrum apparently.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.280]   Well, first of all, why do these cable companies have this spectrum?
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.920]   And what is Verizon going to do with it?
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:26.800]   They're paying $3.6 billion for spectrum licenses from Time Warner, Comcast, and Bright House
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800]   networks.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.600]   Well, spectrum's a rare commodity.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   There's a question.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   There's a question.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   We are out of spectrum.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   Right.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   Right.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   We've taken the spectrum back from Antelong Television.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.040]   We've auctioned off the last of the spectrum.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.480]   You know, who knows what, you know, the cable companies are planning on doing with it.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.680]   Maybe they thought they were going to do wireless internet delivery.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.160]   Maybe they thought they were going to start doing so.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.240]   So they've never really used it.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.160]   I don't think so.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.760]   And maybe this is the whole reason, at least according to this article in CNET written
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.520]   by Marguerite Rydin for the AT&T T-Mobile merger.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.280]   T-Mobile, according to Craig Moffatt, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, poor team pity, poor
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   T-Mobile.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.240]   Verizon just ran off with the last pretty girl in the bar.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.400]   It's a good line.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.400]   What does it mean?
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.600]   Well, it means that there's no more spectrum.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   Are they done?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   The cable companies, you know, a bunch of cable companies basically, a bunch of companies
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.280]   created a consortium to buy this spectrum.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.600]   They paid about $2.4 billion for it.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.240]   They're selling it for what?
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.120]   So they picked up a billion dollars.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   That's always good.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   And some spectrum.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.440]   I think Verizon realized, I talked to the CTO just maybe eight months ago and he said,
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.600]   "We're in no spectrum crunch at Verizon.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.680]   We're fine on spectrum."
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.960]   But I think Verizon probably realized AT&T might not get the steal.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.880]   And the next place they're going to look is to buy it's on a spectrum.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   Right.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.800]   So if we don't get it now, it's going to be a lot more expensive.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.640]   Pulled it off the market, in other words.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.560]   So would you use it for LTE, for existing technologies or would you set up something
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   else?
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.440]   It's another frequency, right?
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   Right.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.600]   So Verizon said the airwaves would open up access to 259 million potential customers
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   for its newest generation 4G LTE service.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.840]   So they would use that for LTE then.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   Presumably.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.480]   I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just so unclear.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.200]   So spectrum is some frequency.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.400]   Chunk of bandwidth is chunk of bandwidth.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.760]   So do we ever say what bandwidth this is that they're buying up?
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.120]   I don't see it as high as low as at the 700.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   Is it the...
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.480]   Verizon's going to get 5 miles and you're just...
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.000]   20 megahertz, which is quite a bit.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   That's 4 TV channels worth.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.020]   It doesn't say where.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.360]   What I don't understand is your 100 megahertz bin.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   Okay.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.600]   So this phone doesn't have 1700 megahertz.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.640]   So you have to make new phones, you have to...
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.740]   Your towers, you have to put in new cell sites with new frequencies.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.740]   That's okay.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.740]   That's okay.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.240]   That's a tax write off.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.000]   So they buy the spectrum and now they have the spectrum and they can read jigger their
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.040]   entire LTE rollout to use this spectrum instead.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.160]   Well, part of the reason they bought T-Mobile was because it's already a GSM provider.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   I'm talking about AT&T.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   It's all right.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   T-Mobile's already GSM.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   That's easy for them to accommodate.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   Same frequency.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   They can push all of their 2G traffic onto T-Mobile's equipment and then use AT&T's existing sites
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.760]   for LTE.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   Right.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.120]   It was just an easy transition for them.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.960]   Verizon, you know, probably saw an opportunity.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.720]   They probably saw that the spectrum that the cable companies hold would get a lot more expensive
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.400]   when there are more buyers looking for it.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   They bought it now.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.160]   Maybe they'll use it for 5G.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   Maybe they'll...
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.880]   It feels like such a Machiavellian chess game because okay, here's another thing.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.400]   These companies Comcast Time Warner were partners with Sprint on Clearwire.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.240]   Sprint's YMAX based 4G.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.720]   Now they're going to pull out a Clearwire.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.080]   So Sprint's left holding the bag with this kind of crappy 4G that didn't work very well.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.840]   Everybody in Portland says it works fine.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.680]   In Portland it works.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.640]   I've tried it in Vegas the only place I've tried it.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   I've never...
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   You said it was good.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   No, I did not.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   I thought you did.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   No, I was underwhelmed.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.080]   Anybody like Clearwire, Sprint's 4G?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.600]   Does anybody get it?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.000]   I've Sprint's 4G from Sprint, not from Clearwire.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   But it's clear...
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.080]   I mean, Clearwire is about to fold for all intents and purposes.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.760]   They're also probably going to end up in their own class action lawsuit because people
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   aren't getting the speeds.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.880]   They were promised or the bandwidth they were promised and their pro-family pissed off about
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   that.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.480]   So Sprint's 4G.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.240]   They just took unlimited Sprint 4G so I'm walking away from Sprint after using them for half
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   a decade.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.480]   Sprint now will have 110 MHz of Spectrum.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.680]   AT&T has 90.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.760]   That's something I can understand.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   That's 20 more.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   Wow.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.440]   We've gotten to the bottom.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.360]   We go to 11.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   This is so complicated.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   We're going to...
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.960]   I've had offers in the past and I know that...
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   I know that...
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   It's like Sasha Sagan from PCMag.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.000]   Well, there are telecom experts out there who listen to the show and they go, "You guys
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   just don't understand this.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I don't."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.080]   And so we're going to get somebody on and they can explain to me what the hell is going
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   on.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   This week in telecom.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   Oh, it'll be fascinating.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   All right.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   Something a little more fascinating.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.120]   Herman Cain dropped out of the race this week.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.800]   Were you following the tweet storms?
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.560]   He quoted from the Pokemon song.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.080]   That I did see.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.320]   When you quote from a Pokemon song, you know you're going to get it from Twitter.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   Right?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   And I think he was...
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.400]   There were a lot of funny tweets.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.240]   Let's see here.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.320]   These are collated from the Mashable collated.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.360]   Rumors of extra merit affair and campaign of presidential candidate who...
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   Okay.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.560]   Herman Cain asked the Secret Service to stay on a few weeks until credible threats from
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.600]   his wife subside.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   President...
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.080]   These are going too fast.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.880]   I believe these words came from the Pokemon movie.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.960]   Cain said, "Pika, Pika, Pika, Chew."
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.600]   Did he say that?
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   No, no.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   He quoted from a part of the song.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   Yeah, that'd be funny.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.400]   And he said a great poet once said, "It wasn't like a gothic coach."
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   A great poet.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   But it was from the Pokemon.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.520]   Just Annamari Cox who writes for a...or is NPR reporter.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.960]   Not to be out on Rick Perry, just put out a press release citing the Teenage Mutant Ninja
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   Turtles.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   The hashtag, by the way, "Cane Wreck."
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   Ouch.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.160]   There were quite a few.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.560]   It was very active.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   Newt Gingrich.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.600]   "Frankly, if I want Herman Cain's endorsement, I may start quoting my little pony.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.280]   Friendship is magic."
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.120]   That's actually his feat.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   Yes!
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.920]   Glenn Fleischman, another journalist.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:53.000]   Cain's campaign is suspended as in the way of Rick when dropped suspended itself in the
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   air.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   They used that, Bradley.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.160]   We're going to suspend our campaign.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   John Fugelsong.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:06.480]   Herman Cain tells the crowd it's time for...I can't read this.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   Plan B.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   Plan B. And half-America replies, "That's what she said."
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.640]   I don't get it.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.920]   But I like it.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.840]   Anyway, the Twitter verse was enjoying.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.720]   So my point is that that was not Newt's feed.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.920]   It was a Newt clone feed.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   Oh, it was a new clue.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   Okay.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Too bad, because that was a good line.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.000]   Yeah, you're not going to get a good line from Newt.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   No.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   That's a historian.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.840]   Really, that's not his feed?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   That's what the...
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   Somebody in the chat room is...
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.920]   Which I believe the chat room is the...
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   They are never wrong.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   It is the Greek chorus.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.480]   Oh, and I get it now.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.800]   Plan B is a day after birth control drug.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.160]   Now I get it.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   New subject.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.560]   Well, I wanted a little interpretation.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   That's all.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   I know.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   All right.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   Enough.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   New subject.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   We'll move on.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   Incredible threats from his wife's side.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   I like that.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560]   I get that.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   That's a good one.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.600]   Um, Wayne Gretzky speaking of Twitter closes his daughter's Twitter feed.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.400]   You don't want to scroll too much farther.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   It gets naughty.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   I clicked.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   I saw the link.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   Twice.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   What happened?
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   Apparently, she's posting pictures.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   She's posting pictures.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   She's posting pictures.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.880]   You mean sexting?
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   Can't...
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.080]   Should I look at this one?
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.720]   No, don't show my...
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   Interesting.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   No, it's not that bad.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   Sexting is kind of...
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   How old is she?
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   Yeah, there's an issue.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   How old is she?
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   You're 22.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   How old is she?
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.480]   How could she even shut down her feed?
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.920]   She's 22.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.560]   And the Toronto Globe and Mail said the pictures were saucy.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.560]   Well, apparently, apparently...
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.040]   The Toronto Globe and Mail...
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.480]   Gretzky apparently doesn't want to have the fourth Cardassian daughter.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.080]   He's probably right.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.520]   How he can shut her feed down is completely inexplicable.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520]   Twice.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.680]   All right.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.560]   Well, we'll move on to a tech subject.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   How about that?
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.120]   Yeah, there's a thought.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:02.600]   So, the guy at the Motion Picture Association of America says, "We'll fix SOPA so that it's
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.160]   OK."
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.680]   And then you'll like it.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   There's a...
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   I thought the SOPA thing...
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   I heard the guys on NPR, the great "NewsHour" show, grilling...
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Or not grilling.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.640]   They weren't grilling anybody, but it was the guy from the US Chamber of Commerce going
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.120]   on and on about how this was really about, you know, stopping all these counterfeit sites
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   at the Rolex system.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.760]   Enforcing the law against criminals because these jobs that...
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.160]   All these Americans that make Rolexes are going to be out of work.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:36.320]   Well, look, if you were trying to get SOPA or IP Protect passed, that's what you would
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320]   say.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   That's the whole point of it.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.800]   It is a whole complete bull crap.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   But isn't that what it is?
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.400]   I mean, from their point of view?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   It's also...
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.760]   It was interesting watching the Senate hearing that was staged for that where it was like,
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.520]   you know, the Chamber of Congress, Union representatives, Hollywood representatives, and then they
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.520]   think they got like one...
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Was it Google they chose as the voice against SOPA?
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   Right.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.120]   And Google walks in basically buying...
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.480]   You know, Google assembles a massive consortium of tech companies that employ tens, if not
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.880]   hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   Right.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   And they're like, "Really?
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   Let's talk jobs."
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   You know, let's not talk about hypothetical.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   It's...
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   I mean, it's funny.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's like, "Well, this is going on.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.800]   We basically have Homeland Security taking websites, you know, seizing websites from
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.480]   people that are posting links to...
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.320]   I'm pretty sure it's Department of Homeland Security, you know, seizing websites for
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.280]   companies that are selling counterfeit goods."
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.120]   Or I believe they're also still going after BitTorrent feeds.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.680]   And it's kind of funny.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.560]   I mean, it's like, you know, it's not that I don't want to protect American industry.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.800]   I'm just like, "Isn't Department of Homeland Security supposed to be doing things like scanning
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.320]   containers, you know, for nuclear devices and helping out with the war on terror and
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   all the other stuff?"
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   Well, you know what the problem is.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.200]   Bootleg movies could have hidden messages.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   If you have...
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.400]   What you do is you find the agency that has the most...
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   Money.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   Money.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.360]   Effectiveness and the least oversight and you say, "Hey, you guys, you could help us."
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   And that's exactly what they do.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.200]   And like any government agency, they like to take on more and more responsibilities because
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.880]   then they get the bigger budget the next year and they get the grow and grow and grow.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   That's the way it works.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:21.380]   Was it the Motion Picture Association that ran the ad saying that like pirating movies,
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.880]   fun terrorists or something?
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.240]   I mean, also one of the more interesting things that happened...
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.320]   They may be right, by the way.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.320]   Well...
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   I mean, all sorts of...
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.160]   Or any kind of crime can be used to fun terrorists.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   Fun terrorists, right?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   Soak and running casinos.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.200]   That's absolutely soak and donut chops.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   Yep.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   That's no problem.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Now, the MPAA...
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.080]   The MPAA basically wrote SOPA.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   Yes.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   They actually...
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   The language is there.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   Really?
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   I thought it was really about counterfeit roles.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   Exes.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   That's weird.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   No, it's about motion pictures.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   Huh.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.720]   So the MPAA who wrote it in the first place say they will be toning down the bill and
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.520]   addressing some of the legitimate concerns.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.720]   Michael O'Leary is the head of the MPAA, the Motion Picture Association of America says
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.360]   he has been huddling with politicians from both parties.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.040]   That's such a bad image.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.080]   The head of the MPAA is huddling...
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.600]   They talk about the back room deals.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   Well, I've been...
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.760]   It's holding a lot of cash.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   I went...
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.240]   Yeah, that's pretty much what's going on.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.320]   I mean, I went off on TEXA a couple, three weeks ago about this because one of the companies
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.800]   that's hired to flood torrent hosting sites basically to do DNS sites saw that there
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.840]   were bit torrent hosting being done in Mission3.com.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   I know.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   Therefore, beshocking.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.640]   And there's large video files.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   It was blocked.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   Hey, nuked our website.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   And then, you know, we finally tried someone down there and basically they were like, "Oops."
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.040]   And at that point I looked at Jim, like, "Come on, get the lawyers.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   Get the lawyers.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   Get the lawyers.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   Get the attack lawyers."
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   He's like, "Let's just walk away from this hole.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   We still can."
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   I remember when that happened.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.760]   But this is, you know, and these are the people who want to be like, "I want to be able
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.640]   to turn off the DNS hosting for any website that I'm pissed off at."
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   Right.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   Hey, guys.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:16.320]   DNS, black hole DNS listing, fundamentally breaking the integral heart of the Internet,
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   or at least in terms of HTTP exchanges.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   That creeps me out.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.200]   Because these people, you know, they make great movies sometimes.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.560]   They make crappy movies sometimes.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.920]   They're great at movies.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.160]   They're really an incredible financial organization that uses movies to gather money and distribute
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   it.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.120]   But man, I do not want them holding a kill switch on any portion of the Internet.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.080]   It's certainly not re-architecting DNS.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.640]   I am with you.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.600]   And the senators that are backing them probably shouldn't be allowed to change how DNS works
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   either.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.040]   But, you know, it's just a bunch of tubes.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.840]   You just re-knot trucks.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.800]   You just, you just not a big truck.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.320]   You re-steer the tube.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.640]   So how many of you have Kindle fires?
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.120]   I reviewed one and give it back.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Really?
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   No interest.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   You didn't like it?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   I bought one. I like it.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   I like everything.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   I like the tube, actually.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   I think it's like the one that is-
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   Do you have a wiggly-leo?
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   It fills a sweet spot.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   Where is it?
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Let's see it.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   It's in the other room.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   Can you bring the Kindle fire out?
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   Yeah, would you bring the-
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   Oh, yeah, he's got one right.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   Bring out the Kindle fire.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   Well, I have mine.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.120]   We don't- All right, go ahead.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   Go ahead.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   You hadn't played with it yet.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.520]   First of all, it's the best Android tablet out there because they've highly customized
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   Android.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   It doesn't feel like Android.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520]   I like it.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.520]   It just turned itself off.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   It's in the drawer to the left of my-
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   On the left there.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   The bottom of the bottom of the top.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.960]   I don't think it matches the iPad in any respect, but I think there's definitely a market for
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.720]   a tablet that caught- You could buy two of these and still have honor bucks left over
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   for apps and movies and-
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   Right.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   There you go.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   Empty bookshelf.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.320]   You can play Plants vs. Zombies.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.120]   You can play Words with Friends.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Angry Birds.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   You can play Anqui Boots.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.080]   Well, it's also- I mean, this is kind of also given away-
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.520]   Racers to sell blades because this is all about creating a portal to Amazon.com.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520]   Right.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.080]   Which is- Although they're not- Totally locking.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.520]   You know, Netflix has an app for this now, so they're not locking out competitors, which
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520]   is good.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.000]   All right.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.240]   I can read the New York Times on it.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.880]   I think they're going to sell a ton of these for the people holiday season.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.000]   Well, they say too that they are.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   It's got a Herky Jerk Quality.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Yeah, see, that's what people say.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Well, it has a junkie processor.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.240]   I mean, inside this thing- Where's the Herky Jerk?
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   What am I?
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   I'm a Herky Jerk.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   Herky Jerk is terrible.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.640]   I see no Herky nor do I see any jerking.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.160]   Yeah, it's jerking and Herky- Where's the Herky- Mate?
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.040]   You know, I'm not for the opinion of the must- Let me play with that because I'd be
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.080]   curious to see if- What's the- What's Herky Jerky about this?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.880]   Go to the main- Go to the home.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   He goes on the main.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   Go to- No, well, he's not now.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.520]   Go to- Well, okay, if I do this- It's Herky Jerky.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   What?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.520]   Here, give it to you.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   Come on.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.760]   Well, maybe it's you- What's Herky Jerk-
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   What John wants you to do is go to the home page.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   Go to the home page.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   And then you flip the cover flow?
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Do the cover flow?
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   This is terrible.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   What's terrible?
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   Look at it.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   What are you talking about?
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   It's a Herky Jerk- Look at that.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   You are a man of superior aesthetics, John, and apparently this is not the tablet for
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   you.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.640]   It's slowly like pops it.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.840]   Can you play movies on it?
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   Yes.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   Do they look good?
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.400]   Well, they're all actually- The movies are somewhat Herky Jerky.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.840]   I don't know if that's a- The problem is I can't tell if that's a bandwidth thing or
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.760]   if it's- You bandwidth?
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.400]   It's not a bandwidth thing.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.280]   I think we have a lot of bandwidth here.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.200]   You have so much bandwidth, it's ludicrous.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   So what do you want to watch?
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   There's a black helicopter flying around.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.200]   So if you're a prime member, which I am, you get- These are all free, which is nice.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.600]   Here, let's watch Little Family.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.520]   Actually, that's not good because it's not- Let me- I'm sorry.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.800]   Let's not do- No porn, no porn.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.080]   No, no, it's just- Let's not do animated.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   Let's do something with video.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.080]   Action.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   Action.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   Okay, I watch- I just watch this.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.080]   Great documentary.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.160]   Dr. Bronner's magic soap.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.880]   I love Dr. Bronner's soap.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   Don't you?
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   Everybody loves Dr. Bronner.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.120]   Here he is with his wife, Mrs. Bronner.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.280]   Well, that's not a very action-packed scene.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   It's moving nice and smoothly.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   He's watching a documentary.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   Look how smooth that is.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.040]   Look how- Okay, I'll jump- I'll jump ahead.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   I'll jump ahead.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   Maybe there's more.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   There's nothing more.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   This is a documentary.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   All right.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   That's a good test to the processor.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.560]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.000]   You want an action movie, right?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.960]   See, this doesn't feel- this feels pretty snappy.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.640]   This is all jumping around.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.600]   You want an action movie.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.000]   Let's see here.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Let's see.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.040]   Top 10.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:44.120]   In the name of the father with- that looks like- what's his name?
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.480]   Daniel Day-Lewis.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Let's watch that.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.080]   That's Irish terrorists, right?
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.160]   Isn't that- Yeah, should we-
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.760]   Get to the gun shooting scene.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Look at that.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   This is good.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Maybe it's a little hurricane.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   Look at it.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   Oh, it's stopped.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   Oh my god.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   It can't even do a logo.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.120]   Now, I don't know if that is- if that's the bandwidth.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.560]   I think that might be the processor.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   I don't know.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   I think it probably is.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.880]   But it's really not that big of a deal.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   I think people are willing to-
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.800]   If you don't give a crap.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   For 200 bucks, I think a lot of donut.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.640]   You know, I do know a lot of parents that are getting this- I don't know, it's black
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   now.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   A lot of parents that are getting this for their kids.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.480]   I thought you've moved in and then you came up with me.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.720]   I mean, this is usable.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   I love the form factor.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   I'm not saying it's not usable.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.760]   I'll take this on the plane to watch movies on the plane.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   I think that's good.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   I'd rather have my laptop.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   Look at the difference in screen size.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.360]   If I want to watch a movie, I'll watch it on a big laptop screen.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.680]   Yeah, but you know, if you think about it, John, if you hold it like this, oh, you got
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   to just hold it like this.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   Yeah, you get closer.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.920]   And then it's wide screen.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.600]   So really, it doesn't- it's just how close it is.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.520]   This is starting to sound like the advertisements for the little glasses that contain the equivalent
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.160]   to a 77 inch.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.160]   I don't know.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.000]   I don't know why, but I feel some affinity for this.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And I hate- I feel like I want to defend it.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.680]   It's a simple- it's basically a simple, easy to navigate user phase.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   It's because you hate Apple.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   It's tight in Amazon.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   I don't hate Apple.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.400]   I'm not fond of it, but I have everything I have as Apple.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   I have an iPad.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.800]   It's stuck in my butt right here.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   Look, I show you.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.040]   Yeah, you showed it a minute ago.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.440]   So, I mean, but you know, there's $2,000 worth of Apple hardware within freaking 18
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.760]   inches of the man that belongs to him.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.840]   I think it's safe to say, even if you hate Apple, it's a complicated relationship and
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.200]   they're getting this money.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.840]   But the thing is, oh, is this is also- this is the gateway.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   They're going to release one for $250.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   It'll get better.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.800]   They'll sell a ton of them and within two years they'll have a $99 version and then
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.440]   they'll be one that you basically get with a freaking Amazon Plus membership in three years.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.080]   You know, about 50 years from now they're going to be fantastic.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.200]   In 50 years now it's going to be a jack.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.360]   Well, look how- look how fast Amazon iterated the original Kindle.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.960]   The first one was really kind of ugly and funny looking and now they're really quite
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   slick.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.640]   I mean, the promise is when Amazon dropped a Kindle it was a pretty revolutionary piece
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   of hardware.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.400]   Not because other people weren't using eink but because they had kind of a super easy,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   well thought out system for getting books into people.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.000]   It was kind of like the iPod for books.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   It was clever.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.660]   And I know my wife, for example, like I handed it to her before we took this like seven-day
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   road trip.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:19.140]   Yeah, she'd read three novels on two of which she downloaded in literally the middle of
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.980]   nowhere in Nevada and Utah.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.340]   And she was like, this is amazing that she's getting her blog feeds on it.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.340]   She's super excited.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.340]   Let me ask you this.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:31.380]   If, okay, so for 50 bucks more you can get one without hesitation which is called the
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.820]   nook tablet.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.980]   It's a double the ram.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.220]   It's faster and it doesn't have that hesitation but it's from Barnes and Noble.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.780]   Would you buy that or this?
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   I would get this.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.060]   It has the movie store and it's more of the complete package.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.580]   How long is Barnes and Noble going to even be in business?
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:55.740]   Even the $500 Android tablets don't have some of the great movie store and TV streaming
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.260]   services and bookstore all of that built in.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:04.900]   Now have you played with Patrick with the Asus transformer?
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   I have not.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   It's quite beautiful.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.180]   It's an Android tablet that has a dock.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.940]   It goes on a keyboard.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:17.380]   I don't think Android's ready really to be honest with you.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.140]   You know, Noble has something fairly simple.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.300]   I think only Android tablet I would use to be honest.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.300]   What is that?
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   Oh, that's it.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.220]   He's browsing casually through the new Oxford American dictionary.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.580]   Does it feel somewhat stuttering and hesitating?
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.580]   Yeah, look.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   It's terrible.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.180]   I should also point out the part of what he's doing is something that you can't do.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.180]   You can do this a lot when you're using it.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.180]   Nobody does that.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.180]   Nobody does that.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   Son of a bitch.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   I can't use this.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.180]   Exactly.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.180]   Actually, some researchers I saw.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.340]   Can I just do one way?
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.340]   Look, it's still stutters.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.860]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   You flip the...
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.260]   Do you read the page while you're turning it?
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   Yes.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.260]   That's impressive.
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.260]   Here, give him the hammer.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.260]   No, it's this guy's machine.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.700]   I know, I'm starting to scare him.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.700]   I'll give him back to him.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.700]   Put that back there.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.580]   Well, okay, let me ask you this.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.300]   So I think we'd all agree that the iPad is the...
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.220]   If price were no object, that's the one to get.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   Definitely.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.540]   But price is an object.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.180]   I mean, we can't eliminate that from the equation.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.020]   And I think that for some people, this is a better choice than the iPad because it's
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.020]   seven inches.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:30.980]   Well, I wrote in my review the iPad's tagline is a magical and revolutionary product at
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.220]   an unbelievable price.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.220]   Yes.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.420]   So, the qualifier is going to need to be removed.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   Can't say it.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   Because now it makes sense.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.420]   Look at that.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   They're pushing up to $1,200.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.980]   Do you remember though that we all put...
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.020]   You know, on January 2010 when they announced the iPad, we all predicted it to be $1,000,
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.020]   800 bucks.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.020]   I was shocked.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   I'm sure everybody was.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.020]   It was $500.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.020]   But it's been almost two years.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.020]   Yeah, it's not the same.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.100]   Well, I think it's also that it's going to be interesting to watch what happens whether
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.580]   or not Apple starts chasing more of the low end.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.580]   No, it's Steve Jones.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.540]   No, I can't imagine them doing that.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   Why should they?
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.820]   At some point it becomes a battle, at some point in the next five years it becomes less
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:09.780]   of a battle over hardware distribution than over music and movie and content distribution.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.780]   I was talking...
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.580]   Because Google, I mean, Google's got the capacity.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.700]   It's interesting to watch what may or may not be rolling out at Google in kind of the
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.900]   back in terms of what they're doing with movie distribution and other form of content.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   I agree.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.620]   I think that Apple has not yet demonstrated it, understands the cloud at all and understands
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.620]   hardware very well.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.140]   And I don't know if going forward hardware is going to be as important as understanding
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.140]   cloud network.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.340]   Wait, Google doesn't understand cloud or Apple doesn't understand cloud.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.580]   Google understands it very well.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.540]   Well, Google, yeah, Google also has...
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.940]   Look at mobile me and look at iCloud.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.860]   iCloud's done okay, I think.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.180]   I mean, they signed up 20 million people in less than a week and it stayed up.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   It hasn't...
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   It's not bad.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.820]   It's just that it's kind of opaque what it does, how to use it.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:57.380]   Well, a better example of Apple fail at kind of social media or cloud would be...
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.380]   Ping.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.380]   What was the point of ping?
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.380]   It's bad.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.380]   And find my friends they've done nothing with.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.380]   Right.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.460]   I'm a social network and barely mentioned anything.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.540]   I think that Steve Jobs...
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:11.780]   I've said this before, but I think Steve Jobs' real talent was physical.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.780]   It was goods.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.220]   He was brilliant at that.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.820]   And I think that he didn't really understand cloud and internet as well.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.020]   And as a result, Apple doesn't have that kind of knowledge.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   They can acquire it.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.980]   In fact, they're trying to hire executives for their cloud initiative.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.220]   But I just think that that's where they're going to need to get good if they want to...
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   I don't think it's low end.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.220]   I think they got to know cloud.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:38.220]   Okay, the other $64 question is cloud going to get kicked to the curb in the next 18 to
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.260]   36 months as the major...
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:45.740]   Well, compared ISPs are starting to shove lower and lower caps on home internet usage.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.940]   Well, that's another issue.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.340]   I think in the long run that's going to lose.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.580]   That bothers me a lot more whether I agree with you.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.740]   Whether it's Amazon or Apple or Google as a source of content, it's much more irritating
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.980]   to me that the carriers seem to be able to pretty much shove through.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.700]   The ISPs seem to be able to shove through whatever caps they want.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   Well, that's where push is going to come to shove, isn't it?
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.860]   Because all of the stuff, including the stuff we do today here, require bandwidth.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.300]   And more and more bandwidth is not going to be less and less bandwidth.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.220]   And it's going to be Netflix and everybody else who are saying, "Wait a minute, you can't
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.220]   cut back on our bandwidth."
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.300]   And that is, I think that's a big fight that's still to come.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.900]   There's actually, I'm going to see if I can find the article.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.500]   Because John and I have had this battle before.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:31.180]   My essential position is that bits are basically free.
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.180]   Remember that battle we saw?
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.180]   Oh yeah, yeah, as far as you're concerned, it doesn't cost anything to do any of this.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.180]   It's all free.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.940]   Well, here's a great summary, by the way.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:41.940]   Essentially.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.340]   Here's a great article from ours technique on Nate Anderson.
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:52.140]   He's quoting a researcher named Benowitz.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.140]   What is his name?
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.140]   I'm going to find his name.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:53:01.580]   But it's his position that in fact, data consumption, it's Benowitz-Feltin, chief research
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.940]   officer at Defraction Analysis.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.980]   Data consumption is at best a poor proxy for bandwidth usage.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:13.380]   Now this is not intuitive, so you'll forgive me if that may sound like a confusing thing.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:20.300]   What he did is he asked internet service providers to provide him with raw data so that he could
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.220]   test his thesis.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:27.860]   Finally, a mid-sized American DSL provider gave him fine grade detail over the course
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.460]   of a single day, 5,000 users.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:38.900]   They broke that down, analyzed it, and essentially came up with the solution that controlling
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:47.020]   real-time congestion by going after high data monthly users is ineffective.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:53.180]   Going after the quote, "Benowitz Hogs" is not how you solve congestion.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.980]   Data caps, he says, are very crude and unfair tool when it comes to targeting potentially
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.540]   disruptive users.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.180]   The correlation between real time, and this is why these caps are bad.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:08.540]   The correlation between real-time bandwidth usage and data downloaded over time is weak.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.420]   In other words, just because you're using a lot of bandwidth doesn't mean you're using
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.420]   a lot of data.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.420]   It could be, I could be using 20 kilobits per second, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.860]   And suck a huge amount of data even though your bandwidth is not very hard.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   I mean, I had an interesting conversation.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.500]   I never thought that, sorry, but I never thought bandwidth and data.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.860]   I don't thought that was the basic argument that we were having.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.140]   We were having a data argument, not a bandwidth argument.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.140]   Well, right now the restriction is bandwidth.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.140]   So you got a big bandwidth.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:38.060]   Okay, so I got 200 down and 100 up, and I'm sitting there doing email.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.060]   I'm not using anything.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   I'm not doing anything.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.060]   Which is exactly what AT&T wants.
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.500]   But if I'm down and you pay for 200, I don't care about that.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:51.860]   It's like if I'm downloading movie after movie after movie 24/7 on even the lesser connection,
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.740]   that seems to be the problem.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.460]   The issue is not excessive use is it's when you're using it.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.380]   If I'm using four megabits downloading a movie along with everybody else in my neighborhood
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.300]   at eight o'clock it, that's the problem.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:09.140]   I may only be using 30, I may only be going through like 100 gigabytes of data, but I
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:14.740]   can do a lot more damage overall to bandwidth capacity than somebody who's basically downloading
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.740]   in the background.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.220]   So we keep operators already throttle that.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.060]   I mean at peak times you'll get slower.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.940]   Which means everybody gets sucky performance and we can't watch Netflix.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.700]   So they're hitting it in two different directions.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.620]   They're going after the 250 gigabyte plus users.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:34.060]   Even those guys may not in fact according to this data are not impacting congestion.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.500]   They're doing it in the morning.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   Think about it.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   If you're one of these guys.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   In the morning.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.060]   If you're downloading a lot of data.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   You got it.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.060]   That's the problem.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.820]   That's a no agenda listener right there.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   There's one.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.500]   He's also by the way the same guy who plays Skyrim eight hours a day.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.500]   Well, it's part of your audience.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.460]   Part of what to do.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.260]   But I think this is important because they're going after these big bandwidth hogs.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:04.300]   Bandwidth hogs are smart enough to use it in off hours because they want fast downloads.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.300]   But part of what's interesting.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.380]   Barbara and reports DSL reports.com.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.940]   One of the things they point out is that the Bloomberg article that was the source of
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.940]   this.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.460]   Watching Netflix could lead to higher cable bills is basically quoting one Wall Street
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.460]   analyst.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   And this is a Wall Street analyst.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.820]   It's basically been going, you know what?
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.580]   It's time to lower those data caps and get more over its charges because that worked for
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.100]   credit card companies.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.500]   It works for cell phone companies and it'll work for cable companies.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.420]   You'll get more money without having to deliver any more services to the customer.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.500]   Well, I'm not sure where you're going with this, Leo.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.460]   But what's your point?
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:42.220]   My point is that the cable companies aren't really interested in congestion.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.820]   They're really interested in being anti-competitive.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   They don't like it.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.060]   What are you giving that?
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.060]   Of course.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.060]   They're always anti-competitive.
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:54.860]   Well, but they're using bandwidth caps as a way to fight companies like Netflix.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.060]   Only what they don't want is they don't want you watching movies on your internet stream.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.700]   They want you to pay for HBO.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.700]   Of course.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.700]   And they don't want you using Skype.
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.700]   They want your 127 channels.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.580]   I actually like the way the big dishes have it where you can buy by the hour.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.260]   I'll take HBO for two hours.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:19.780]   I guess my only point is that we really don't get the internet we deserve in this country.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.660]   There are plenty of places where you get much better internet quality for much less cost.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.380]   Although our mobile networks tend to be better.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.940]   Our mobile networks are faster.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   Is that true?
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.900]   Yeah, I wonder if that's from lack of use that we aren't yet saturated with, you know,
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.140]   I'm sure in Japan, per user, they use more now.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.300]   I don't think so.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.300]   What is it?
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   Why is it better than?
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.820]   I think our network tends to be pretty competitive because a lot of people, you know, we're the
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.300]   one of the highest rates we want.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.180]   Smartphone adoption and we're using a lot.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.740]   Yeah, we want it.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:54.340]   So back to the point, what is the point?
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340]   What do you think?
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:01.940]   I think we've got a big push come to shove coming here because users want not only no
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.620]   bandwidth caps because bandwidth caps are really ridiculous.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.620]   We want all the bandwidth.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:09.300]   We want unlimited data and we want to pay as little as possible for it.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   And it's possible.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.300]   I'm limited data.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.500]   I'm talking about just mobile you're talking about.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.980]   I'm talking about terrestrial.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.500]   Mobile is another problem entirely.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.100]   Yeah, so we just not unlimited data.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.100]   That's what you're going to get.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.420]   We're not a strange resource.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.380]   That was Google's point where they're, which is that these bands, you know, the headends
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:28.620]   to the cell to cell sites are, you know, one and a half megabits and we've got a thousand
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.300]   people all hitting at the same time.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.180]   That's a much more constrained resource.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:36.860]   It's my opinion that is not a constrained resource in terrestrial and land based internet.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.940]   It's artificially constrained because they truthfully, they just don't want us using
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.100]   it that way.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.300]   There's plenty of bandwidth.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.300]   Bits are cheap.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.300]   It's even more.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.700]   They have to deal with the fact that we're going to slowly evolve to IPTV as the main
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.700]   they don't want right.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.700]   They don't want it.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   So they're going to this way it is.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.420]   That's my point is they're going kicking and screaming.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.540]   They're using bandwidth hogs as a straw man.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.900]   So this is what they're really issue with the real issue is they don't want us doing
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.700]   the things we want to do with the internet.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.260]   They want us to use the internet to, you know, shop at Amazon.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:09.340]   Well, it's also the Bloomberg article basically quotes Craig Mothad who's at San Francisco
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:14.860]   Bernstein company quote, you know, Cox communications charter or time order cable may be first to
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:18.460]   charge Web access to customers for the amount of data they consume, not just transmission
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.460]   speed.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.460]   Right.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.460]   Which that's coming.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:22.460]   We're going to have tears.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.460]   Absolutely.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.460]   Right.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.020]   No, by the way, it's what they do on the cell phone, right?
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:28.020]   Essentially it's per bit.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.660]   You get five gigabytes ago more than that.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.300]   We're going to pay per paper gigabyte or maybe they're going to do it like an electrical
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.700]   building just going to flat charge you for every bit you down.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.100]   And that's my biggest fear.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.540]   I think it's going to be like water.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.580]   The water bill, the electrical bill is a utility.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.340]   But water is but water is a limited resource.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.700]   Bits are not.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:44.700]   Bits are infinite.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.220]   You've built out the infrastructure to serve infrastructure is the only cost.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:53.020]   Water is the I was the argument you and I always have the water get rains.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.020]   It goes into the bucket.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.020]   It goes back into the market.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.500]   You know, like a man you do not with a patchy water.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.300]   You do not go to a part of the country that did I don't care about your stuff around here.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.900]   Yeah, but water is different.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.460]   It goes into the house and you go down and it goes back into the sky.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   Comes back into the infrastructure.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   So what you're saying is government should do water delivery.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.380]   I know I didn't get it.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.900]   If by his logic water should be free.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.500]   Actually, government should do internet delivery.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.660]   What should happen is the municipalities should provide the transport.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.300]   There's a lot of Philadelphia.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.620]   Philadelphia did that Verizon got pissed off their legislature.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.620]   Exactly.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620]   I think I don't know what the final number was.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.020]   They shut down municipal Wi-Fi for that reason.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020]   Because they don't want the competition.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020]   State legislature level.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.620]   When they didn't even want a wire Philadelphia.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:46.700]   We want competition and I think that these guys are using straw men to basically be any
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.940]   competitive not because there's a real issue with congestion.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.500]   Maybe this is the opportunity for Google to come to the world's waters.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.740]   Water is free somebody says Greg.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.180]   Water is free it just costs to get it same with bits.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.420]   No, nobody's producing the bit.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.940]   You don't get the bit by going outside saying come on bits come on over.
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   They do.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.940]   That's exactly what happens.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.940]   They come.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:10.940]   Yes.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.140]   What you're doing is you build the infrastructure as a capital expenditure.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.340]   It's one time only.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340]   There's some maintenance costs.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.340]   It is not.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340]   It's one time only.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.740]   But no water has to be made.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.740]   No water can't.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:25.220]   Do you think they just get it from the sky?
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.820]   It grows on trees ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.380]   This edition of Twit is turning into like a Bill Maher show.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.500]   So somebody said this edition of Twit is brought to you by Ford and the great Ford
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.500]   Sync.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.500]   I parked my Mustang out there.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.020]   I came here to see the electric focus.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   It's not out yet.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.860]   But I promise you when we have when I get the focus because I got on the list, they're
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.860]   all leaving.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.860]   Go ahead.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:49.860]   You can go to Mark.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.860]   Just take a walk.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:51.860]   Go ahead.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.780]   No, I'm fine.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.780]   All right.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:01.740]   Any three of you come sit down.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.020]   You, you and you come here sit down.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   All right.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.900]   And I won't feel so lonely.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   Do you like Ford?
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.900]   I love Ford.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   All right.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   Of course you like.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.900]   How about Ford?
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   I drove a Camaro here.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.900]   I don't want to talk to you.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.540]   My first car was a Ford.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.540]   What kind of Ford was it?
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540]   It's a Ford Escort.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540]   Oh, you, yeah.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.020]   You got to see what they have done.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.820]   I'm going to go take the three of you for a ride on my Mustang.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.060]   Screw these other guys.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.020]   And we'll do this again when the electric focus comes out.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.620]   The 2012 focus, amazing.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.460]   And I want to show you the Ford Sync and the My Ford Touch.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.860]   You can now, I got to warn you, you can play videos or display photos on this, on this
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.300]   beautiful screen from your, right from the digital camera, your portable game device,
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.420]   but you can only do it when it's in park.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.780]   I don't want you doing it when it's driving.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.980]   The whole idea here is we keep our hands on the wheel, our eyes on the road and talk
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.980]   to the car.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.860]   You can say what song to play, what genre, what track.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.220]   You can say play, twit, you know, and it will automatically find it.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:04.460]   If you've got your smartphone has Pandora, Stitcher, Slacker radio, it's amazing.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.700]   And now with the Sync with My Ford Touch on the HD radio, if you like the song, you're
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.860]   listening to a radio station and HD radio sounds beautiful.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.980]   I like this song.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.860]   You can actually tag it and then go back when you get home, buy it on iTunes.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.100]   It's things like this that just really are state of the yard.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.420]   I like the Camaro.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.580]   Don't get me wrong, but you can't do that in a Camaro.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.580]   You can't.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   There's no GPS.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   There's no GPS.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   Is it a rental Camaro?
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.580]   Oh, well, that's, you know, there you go.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.580]   It's a convertible.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.500]   Next time, well, Mustang, I'm telling you Ford.com/technology.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.100]   You can go to that website, you can find out a whole lot more about it.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.220]   Camaro's a nice car, but it doesn't have sync.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.220]   You know, it's funny.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.300]   I think in many ways, sync sells cars, sync in my Ford Touch sells cars.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.220]   I know you buy a car to get around, but this stuff is so cool.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.220]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.860]   There's the website.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.120]   Take a look at it.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:53.180]   Get to know what they've got and then drive one and afford dealer today.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.180]   What's your name?
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180]   Lisa.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.780]   Lisa, you came with this guy who's a Skyrim player, right?
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   I did.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780]   Where are you guys from?
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.780]   Oh, that's great.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780]   Well, it's nice to have you.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.100]   So you were saying, what's your husband's name?
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.100]   Glenn.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.900]   You said when Glenn plays Skyrim, you get a girl's night out.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900]   Absolutely.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.900]   Yeah, I think that's a good deal.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.900]   That's fair.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.900]   I think it's Lisa time.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.900]   Lisa time.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.740]   That's what you should call it, Glenn.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.940]   You say, hey, it's time for Lisa time.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940]   Linda.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.740]   Who's Linda?
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   Lydia.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]   Oh, Lydia.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   Yes.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.260]   My Lydia died right away.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.260]   Has your Lydia survived?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   You know why?
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.420]   Because you keep making potions and crap.
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.540]   You've got to get out there and fight.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.540]   And what's your name, sir?
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.860]   Michael, you're from Edmonton.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   Yes.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860]   And what does this say?
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.860]   This says--
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   Beak from Yoga.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:37.860]   That's a great tattoo.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.860]   In the mission.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   Yes.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860]   Mission San Francisco?
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860]   You got it.
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860]   You're not really from Edmonton.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   I am.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   I just visited.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.860]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.860]   And you did beak from Yoga?
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.860]   I do.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.860]   My wife owns a studio in Edmonton.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.860]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.860]   That's the hot yoga.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   It is very--
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.860]   How hot is it?
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   40 degrees, 105 Fahrenheit.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.860]   40 degrees Celsius.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.860]   Wow.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:57.100]   And 40% humidity.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.100]   And then you, sir, your name?
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.100]   I'm Jason.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.100]   And where are you from?
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   San Francisco.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.100]   Great.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.020]   And why do you have a bandaid on your forehead?
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.020]   Wow.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.420]   Did you fall when you got here?
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.660]   No, all right.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.660]   I won't pry.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   If you don't want to talk about the bandaid--
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.660]   Last night of November.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.660]   --Movember, you shaved and you grew your mustache.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.660]   I did shave after I--
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.660]   Did you do Movember?
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.660]   I did.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.460]   How much money did you raise?
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.460]   Zero dollars.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460]   Oh.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.460]   But you did it for awareness.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.460]   Awareness.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.460]   Awareness.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.460]   Awesome.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   That's great.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   Well, congratulations.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   But you did you shave it off right away?
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.460]   Actually, today.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.460]   I knew I was going to have a cameo.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.460]   I'm going to shave his mustache.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   No, I like it.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.460]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.340]   But the problem is, November, he can't grow it.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   He's starting.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.340]   He missed out on Movember.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.260]   Anyway, great to meet all of you.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.420]   Thank you for being here.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.180]   All right, I think our hosts are back.
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.180]   Thank you.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.180]   Yeah, really nice to see you.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:47.820]   40 degrees and 40% humidity.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820]   Yes, sir.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.820]   Wow.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.980]   Actually, the best Yelp reveal I ever read was something
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.660]   that's like, I went to this beakroom yoga and it was hot and they had a bowl of carpet.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.660]   I mean, how can you do yoga and it's like--
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.660]   Why do they do that?
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.660]   It's fucking copyright.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.660]   They did.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.820]   So you're going to have a big party back there.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.300]   I mean, what?
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.300]   What?
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.300]   That.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.300]   What?
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.300]   There's stuff going on back there?
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300]   What's going on?
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   Shh.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   It's gone a long way.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.300]   Shh.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   It's gone a long way.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.300]   They have the-- for people that are going to--
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300]   Spoons?
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.340]   They have-- you have all the Lagunitas and the people who have not had Lagunitas ale should
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.140]   make sure to check it out because it's one of the best areas in the world.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   What's the story, Chad?
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.140]   Is that for later?
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.580]   There's-- we have catered food for later.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.460]   I thought it was Twizzlers and Popcorn.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   No, no, no.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.460]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.460]   I didn't mean to disappoint you.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.820]   Some of these people over ate Twizzlers and Popcorn.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.100]   They thought that's all they were getting.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100]   So we're going to feed them.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.660]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.660]   That's nice of them.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.820]   Thanks to Lin Fu for working around.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.300]   Lin Fu who produced that.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.380]   Who catered it, do you know?
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.380]   The local folks.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:50.540]   You know, I'm going to end up with more people showing up just to eat.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.540]   That's awesome.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540]   I had no idea.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   Well, please after the show if you want to eat.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.540]   Well, thanks, Leo.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.540]   Thanks.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.540]   He's already broken up.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540]   Did you already open?
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.060]   Well, I'll fade off, didn't you?
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.180]   I had checked some of the wines out in there.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.580]   Chefs and Loganese, what is that?
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:06.460]   This is the season that the special brew for the Christmas
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.540]   thing, yeah.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.860]   Is it good?
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   You know what we drink most of the time?
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.180]   It's not as good as the real deal.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.300]   We drink the something something.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.020]   Have you ever had that?
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:13.540]   That's really good.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.260]   They have that back there.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.100]   A little something something.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:15.620]   Have that.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.540]   That's a good one.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.220]   Spotify has created a platform.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.460]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:26.700]   I immediately installed the Spotify stuff.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.220]   Third party apps, people will be also able to include Spotify
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.220]   in their app.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.220]   What do you think?
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220]   It's not available yet, is it?
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.220]   It's like a week or two.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.220]   Well, there's a beta.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.220]   Okay.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.340]   So if you download the Spotify app beta, see this is not the
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.100]   beta, but I have it on my other computer, you can install,
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.900]   I'll give you a good example.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.820]   WikiTunes will do the lyrics as you play the song and it
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.820]   syncs the lyrics.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.900]   So it's almost like karaoke.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.940]   You can see, I think it's just great.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.980]   Is Spotify going to be the dominant music platform going
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980]   forward?
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:58.980]   Is iTunes?
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   I just heard somebody say back and go, "Yes."
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.980]   Really?
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.980]   You agree?
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.100]   I see, I love it.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.660]   And then I see these people in the front saying, "No."
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.620]   And I'm thinking Patrick, who is the guy who likes to buy
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   music.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.380]   I don't, sorry, I just, I want a copy of my music basically.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.780]   I want a hard copy of my music.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.780]   I want the best quality.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.260]   I mean, you know, I love Pandora and stuff like that.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.300]   I get Spotify, but most of my really serious music listening,
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.860]   I do with a lossless copy that's off of a hard drive.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.340]   I think that what's changed.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.660]   I think that you can do more.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.660]   What do you say, there's wave files?
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.540]   No, you probably use Flacker or Apple lossless, depending on
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.660]   which system it's compressed or a lossless compression.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:42.940]   So it would be my guess that people will start to say this is
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   the end of music, that what's happened is music's disposable.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.460]   So it started with an album.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.620]   It's like Bits.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.620]   Yes, like Bits.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.620]   It is Bits.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.620]   It's not like Bits.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.620]   It is Bits.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.100]   It's not like the CEO of Spotify.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.420]   His catchphrase is music should be like water.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   Daniel Eck.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]   And well, we're going to interview him at Loub.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.620]   I'll ask him about this because I think that I'm starting to see,
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.380]   you know, there was a time you'd get the album.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.620]   There was this tangible media.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.260]   You held some of us still buy albums.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.260]   I know I'm a dinosaur.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.340]   No, no, no, it's changing.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.820]   A lot of people admit it's not going to stay that way.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.580]   But it certainly must last prevalent.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.780]   Although we were talking about this last week and somebody told me
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:23.260]   CDs are still the best selling format for music way beyond digital.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260]   There you have it.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.020]   I don't believe it, but that's what they told everybody like you says that.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.020]   I don't believe that.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   Yeah, I know.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.500]   I've also I mean, I've also had people serious people serious, serious
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.660]   technology analysts be like, well, there's I just don't see a difference
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.100]   between streaming Netflix and a Blu-ray.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.460]   And it's like, well, obviously, yeah, you know, yeah, that is funny.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.460]   It's worth the laugh, but it's, you know, most people don't.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.620]   Yeah, I do.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.620]   I understand.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:52.140]   I'm content was I'm always wondering if they're either fooling themselves
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.140]   or they're full of crap.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   They're content.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.140]   It doesn't matter.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.140]   There's still a lot of odd born.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.940]   It's good and the adequacy is sufficient.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.180]   Yeah, the accuracy is sufficient.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.380]   And I'm saying the same thing.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.460]   We went from tangible physical discs where an artist would create an entity that was,
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:09.100]   you know, Sergeant Pepper was 10 cuts that all went together.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.180]   Steve Jobs completely broke that model by saying we're going to sell 99 cent individual
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.180]   tracks.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.180]   He didn't break that novel.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.180]   There were 35 RPM records.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.500]   There weren't that many singles.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.500]   There were singles.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.060]   But now during the 50s and 60s, it was all things.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.500]   I suspect people will buy a few or fewer albums and we'll just buy singles.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   You're right.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.180]   And it was at the four of them during the 78 era was nothing but singles.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.180]   All right.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.180]   Okay.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.180]   You're right.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.180]   Never mind.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:37.100]   But gramophone, the one I still have one of those is a dual gramophone and you crank it
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.460]   and you get to you have 78.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   But there's no.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.420]   I just think I do have a thorough instrument here, but it does.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   Do you?
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.980]   It's the commoditization of music.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:47.980]   The music has become fun.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.140]   Music has been a commodity ever since there've been record companies.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.140]   Funge a music.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.900]   It's been a commodity ever since recorded media started by fungible.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:01.900]   I mean interchangeable commoditized that today's pop hit is evanescent.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   Oh, please.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.180]   I think you got fungible wrong.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.180]   Did I get fungible wrong?
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.820]   I might have because I've always misused fungible.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.540]   I just like saying it.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.620]   It's like the runcible spoon.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.780]   It's the property of a good or commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.140]   such as crude oil, wheat, precious metals.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.420]   In other words, one pop song is much like another.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.380]   They're fungible.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.340]   I think I used it perfectly actually.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.340]   Brother.
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:33.060]   No, that's my point is this garbage.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.980]   People said Sinatra was garbage.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.740]   People said, I mean, people tried to rip the canvases off the wall.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.900]   It was the first, I can't remember if it was, oh God, I can't think of the pain or the
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900]   pain.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:48.300]   I think people who will treat it as you do and as maybe I do as something very, as art,
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.220]   as a unique, wonderful creation.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.420]   But I think things services like Spotify basically say, all you can eat for 10 bucks.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.020]   It's all the same and you don't need it next month.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.020]   It's in another set.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.620]   It's a buffet of greasy food.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.780]   They do that for TV.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.460]   That's how the cable model works and people still value individual shows.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.260]   Lost on ABC versus another network.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.260]   It's a different model.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   Sometimes it isn't, some ways it isn't because the cable-
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.380]   So why do you want to own it?
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:20.260]   I want to own it because I went to watch a movie the other day on iTunes and it's not
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.220]   on iTunes anymore and it's not on Netflix.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.700]   Ah, so it might go away.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.180]   It might go away.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.260]   Somebody gets into a SNIT.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.860]   They might pull their digital rights away from service acts or service-
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.860]   Because that's a good reason.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:31.620]   Own it because it might go away.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:36.660]   In some cases, they aren't delivering it at the full capacity.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:42.220]   It's one thing to listen to a highly compressed pop song, whether it's, you know, and I'm
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.700]   going to call punk pop for purposes of argument.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.260]   But you know, a highly compressed punk song doesn't lose a lot.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.940]   You know, mail or a show-panc gets a little ugly when you compress the hell out of it.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:56.140]   You take a Beach Boys single and you know, it's just, I want the purest example of it
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.580]   I can get, at least in a digital format.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:02.060]   You know, and I'm going to hoard it away in a closet so that when I'm 70 and I want to
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.660]   listen to black flags depressing because I'm pissed off at the world or I'm in cotton
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:09.340]   or whatever the issue is, I can listen to my angry music.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:13.380]   So do you think that you are nuts?
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.500]   No, but do you think that- Okay, what's your relationship to music?
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.820]   You have a basement full of wine.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   I don't have wine.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.660]   I got a basement full of CDs.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.860]   And so I'm wondering how common the music is-
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.420]   I think the sound quality argument is an outlier.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.660]   But the idea that the music, you know, that they may get in a fight with war and then
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.620]   Warner will pull their entire catalog, that's a reality.
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.580]   But most people don't care about what- about any music, enough to care about that.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.820]   I also don't think I buy an album per month.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:44.820]   So why would I spend $10 for- Oh, you don't?
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.100]   No, I probably- maybe eight albums a year.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.580]   How many albums do you own total?
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:52.980]   Do you consider yourself- So Spotify is a bad deal for you.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   It would only be a good deal for somebody who would buy a CD a month because it's roughly
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.980]   ten bucks a month.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.980]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:58.980]   I don't know.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.380]   I mean, some people, they start playing around.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:04.540]   I know people who weren't buying much of the way of music and they stumbled into iTunes
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.540]   when they were digitizing the CDs.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.540]   Yeah, me CDs.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.540]   All of a sudden they're like, "Oh my God, this is amazing.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540]   Remember this one?
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.620]   Oh my God, there's so many albums I've never heard of."
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:16.900]   I actually did that when I discovered Napster, but the same idea.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.900]   Sort of.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   I was the only guy on the screensaver that didn't download everything from Napster.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.140]   Ten gigabytes, baby.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.140]   You missed out.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   You missed out.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.140]   It actually must be the sound of my cast.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.140]   It was the golden age.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.140]   It was 128k.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:32.340]   I was worried about what if some- the Napster goes away.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.140]   And I was right.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:38.100]   So I'm just wondering, back it up, baby, just wondering, yeah.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.100]   I don't know.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.620]   I'm just wondering what the future of music and music sales holds.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:47.060]   I feel like Spotify is more the future than iTunes is.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.300]   You would hold with Steve Jobs if people want to own it.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.580]   Well, I don't know.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:55.460]   Whether or not people want to own it, the biggest complication in the future of music
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.420]   is the major recording companies, whether it's Warner Brothers or TV.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.420]   And they're history.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.100]   They're not history.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.900]   They're not.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.540]   They may be dinosaurs on the down curve, but there's a lot.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.180]   There's still a lot of people making music who don't want to deal with-
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.900]   So you find a kid?
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.900]   ... in promotion.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.900]   You find a kid.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:16.540]   You know, there's a lot of people who want- it's so funny.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:19.260]   Who's the guy at the lyricist for "The Grateful Dead"?
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.260]   Barlow.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.900]   John Kerry Barlow, yeah.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:26.380]   You know, and who's- I think it was Barlow, and this is some of- I have a lot of respect
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:30.580]   for the man, but you know, I believe it was him who was like, "Smash the record companies."
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.740]   It's like, "Well, sure, smash the record companies.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.340]   If you've got frickin' zillions in the bank, you're done.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.500]   You made your money.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.780]   Why not smash the record companies?"
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.100]   It's easy to be like smash the record companies when you're the rolling stones and you've got
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.140]   a billion dollars in annuities and half-lundered in your trust fund.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.660]   On the other hand, you can make the argument that anybody who's ever worked with record
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.940]   companies hates them more than those of us who've not worked with them.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.420]   Well, but it's interesting.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420]   Look at it.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.780]   There's a lot of people- there's a lot of whether it's country artists or folk artists
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.500]   or punk artists or classical artists who never expected to make a bunch of money and never
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.100]   expected a record deal and they're perfectly happy.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.420]   And make all their money off of touring.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.060]   There's a lot of companies like the Mike Watquot.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.980]   Well, the albums were always kind of a flyer to get people to the shows because they make
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:15.980]   the money off the show.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.980]   That's never gonna change.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.980]   Yeah, that's never gonna change.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.580]   I'll tell you one thing.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.820]   Nobody wants to buy.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:21.820]   Yahoo.
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.660]   Great transition.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.660]   Wow.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.260]   There's the segue of the day.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.620]   I want that into the end of year collection.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.380]   That was the best segue of 2011.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:40.140]   So now they're trying to put together a pipe, a private investment in public equity so that
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.940]   if it's below 20% Yahoo can avoid a shareholder vote on this.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:53.300]   So Silver Lake actually does, which is an investment firm, has offered $16.50 a share
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   for Yahoo.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:17:02.380]   And they would buy 20% of Yahoo.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.740]   Raise a little cash, I guess.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:08.420]   Is that why Yahoo is doing this?
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.980]   And from, I'm sure Microsoft will be part of this and part of the reason Microsoft wants
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:20.380]   to keep this around is because of Bing and they're kind of like the last Bing customer.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.700]   Yahoo.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700]   One of the...
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   One of the...
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   One of the last and first.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.460]   First and only.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.300]   Under the plan from Silver Lake, three board seats on Yahoo as well as another one for a
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.460]   CEO of its choosing.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.060]   Another seat will go to Yahoo co-founder, current board member Jerry Yang.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.320]   They'll be six independent board members.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.740]   One of the board members would be Mark Andreessen.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.600]   There was a report that they wanted him to run it.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   Maybe even run it.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.500]   It's like a new one.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   What is going on?
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.400]   It seems like Yahoo should be worth more than it is.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   Or am I wrong?
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.300]   Yahoo's got a terrible reputation.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.100]   But they have a great portfolio of products.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.300]   Well, I had a good column in market watch last Friday.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.000]   You should all read it.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   Does it have anything to do with Yahoo?
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.100]   No, actually it was in PC Magazine.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.100]   Okay.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.100]   One of the two.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.100]   What's it about?
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.100]   Yahoo.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.100]   That's good.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.100]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100]   Very topical.
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.700]   I just thought I'd throw that in there.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.700]   People want to go check it out.
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.000]   What was your point of view in the article?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   Pretty much what you're saying.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Okay.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Like it's a valuable company.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   Why is it being treated like a bird?
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.600]   I think it's a bunch of things that can happen to it.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.800]   It can be busted up.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.400]   It could be it could be chopped up.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   It could be re-or it has a lot of problems.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   Is this the Google goes Yahoo column?
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.800]   I feel like I've been Rick rolled.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.500]   Is that the name of it?
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.200]   Google seems to be following down the path of Yahoo.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.000]   It might want to hit the brakes and turn around.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   What do you say to the board?
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Well, it's the windshield ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   Yahoo is in the name.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   That's all.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.200]   I mean, it's a date on it.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.000]   November 28, 2011.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   Date nine.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   November 28.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.600]   No, this is an older one.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]   That's not it.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600]   Let's see.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600]   What else?
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   I'm buying Yahoo.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.000]   Here are some tactics.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.680]   Potential buyers could try to manage the mess that is Yahoo.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.680]   I guess that's my opinion.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.160]   Is it a management issue?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.600]   That's what everybody says.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   It's a management issue.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600]   Everybody says that.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.080]   And even everyone who goes and visits you guys home, my God, this Play-Pro, this is out
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   of control, this company.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.960]   Nobody knows who's reports to who.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.960]   It's a mess.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.440]   Could you go in to a company that's that messed up in your experience and fix it?
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.480]   Not you, Mark Andreessen.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.080]   Is it fixable or is it?
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.720]   There's been person after person that tried to do fixable.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.360]   Nobody thought AOL was fixable in the late '90s.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.320]   Has AOL been fixed?
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.560]   I'm sorry, AOL was not been fixed.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560]   No, you're right.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560]   But you're right.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.560]   Apple was 90 days away from bankruptcy.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.840]   Yeah, but he had a charismatic leader that started the company, came back and made a big
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840]   difference.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.640]   Jerry Yang tried to do that, but he couldn't pull it off.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   He's not a charismatic leader.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   He wasn't.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.560]   He was also fighting with the board.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.400]   There's internal disputes.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.480]   I mean, it's kind of funny.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:53.040]   It's also, it's experience hit-wise, saying that Microsoft has 30% of the search market.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   Based on Yahoo.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   Based on Yahoo.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.720]   14.32% from Bing.com, 15.69% from Yahoo's search, which is powered by Bing.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.880]   So almost half of it is Yahoo.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   Right.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.880]   How about RIM?
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880]   What about those guys, huh?
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   Blackberry.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.080]   Yeah, they're still in business.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:14.640]   Two RIM executives got so drunk and rowdy on a flight from Beijing to Toronto.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.840]   The pilot had to land in Vancouver.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.640]   He'd already got all the way to Alaska and flew back to Vancouver and said, "You guys
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.960]   off the plane."
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.680]   They were afraid that China was going to impound the plane.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.360]   That's why they didn't want to go the whole way.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.360]   You're kidding?
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   Is that true?
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   Is that what we're afraid of?
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   Yeah, that's in the New York Times piece.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   Oh my God.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360]   All right.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360]   Not good.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   What were they doing?
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   I mean, just drunk.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.440]   George Campbell and Alexander Whistling got so drunk and rowdy in a flight from Toronto
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   to Beijing.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.760]   The pilot grounded the plane in Vancouver.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.680]   It was worth it for the pilot to turn around after heading north to Alaska.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.080]   I guess to save the plane.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.720]   With that, with that happen, the Chinese authorities would just take the plane, huh?
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.480]   I've never heard of such a thing.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.680]   Oh, you never know.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.640]   Meanwhile, we found out that maybe this is why they were drinking.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:08.040]   The playbook fiasco cost RIM $485 million.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.640]   That's probably a lot more manageable than the $100 million that Logitech is riding off
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   against Google.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.640]   Right.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.240]   It's a TV experience, a review.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.760]   Half a billion dollar hit for inventory that must be sold at rock bottom prices.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.120]   RIM announced on Friday the company wouldn't be meeting its financial targets for the year
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.800]   primarily due to the playbook.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.960]   That's kind of, you know, I liked the playbook.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   It's kind of sad.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.960]   Since when?
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.720]   Well, they didn't like it a lot.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.160]   It's the same hardware as the fire.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   Similar on the outside.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160]   It's the same.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160]   It looks the same.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   But it's a play-wise, not quite so.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.960]   But it's been pulled from the best buy site.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.200]   And basically, RIM doesn't want to make any more of these if they're losing that much
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.720]   money on them.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.720]   They sold 150,000 units this quarter, 250,000 the quarter before, half a million.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.280]   It's been going downhill.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.560]   And now you can buy it.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.880]   I can't buy it for 99 bucks or can you?
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   Dramatically discounted prices.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.760]   If somebody has a hack for HP.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.080]   If somebody would hack it, just do something else, I think it'd be kind of cool.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.200]   Well it's interesting because RIM also kind of gave us a roadmap for future blackberry
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.200]   devices.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.000]   And I guess the playbook was running QNX.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.720]   And I guess they're looking at a kind of a hybrid, they're leaving that.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.280]   I blame them.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   It's kind of boring.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:25.080]   Well, where's those guys that set the empty chairs in the back?
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.520]   We need that to chair sitters.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.160]   Like they have the Academy of Awards.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.160]   Yeah, boom.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.760]   Usually that's because somebody got it to get an award though.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.960]   So this is functionally similar.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   But not exactly.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   I mean, if similar.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   But not.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   You got a playbook there?
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   Let's see.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   It's a little bigger.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   Screen's the same.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.200]   It's just a bigger bezel.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.240]   See if it's hesitant to you.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.720]   See if it's jerky.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720]   Quick, low-dictionary.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720]   I think QNX.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   Performance.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.320]   I think actually it turned it around.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320]   It's a little bit there we go.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.320]   See how fast that is?
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   Yeah, actually it was pretty quick.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   It's very snappy.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:02.520]   Yeah, the Kindle Fire specs page says fast dual core processor.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]   Yes.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.400]   Well, it's kind of like the Rolls Royce where it says horsepower adequate.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.960]   That's my favorite car.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   If you have to ask.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   Car brochure of all time.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.040]   It's adequate for the size of the vehicle.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:17.640]   So they've got a new BBX operating system.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.040]   We're going to see the Blackberry Nevada in November of next year.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.800]   This is for 2012.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.560]   March the Blackberry Milan.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.200]   The Blackberry Baron desert.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.280]   The Blackberry nuclear testing site.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.600]   The Blackberry Lisbon.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.120]   And there will be a 10-inch tablet.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.040]   Black Forest is what they're calling that.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:42.040]   And purported to leave the bland playbook looks behind in favor of the angular lines
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:45.240]   you'll see here in the London.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.720]   That's pretty.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.120]   Is that a phone or a tablet?
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   That's a fablet.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.040]   It's like a tablet with handles.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.160]   I don't know if we can get a tone.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   It's a tone.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160]   A tone or a fablet.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.080]   I don't know what it is.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.080]   That's a phone I believe.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.520]   This thing's supposed to work.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.840]   You know the coolest thing is slide up.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   Slide up.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   Slide up from the bottom.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   Okay.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   Slide down.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   Okay.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.840]   Slide.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.840]   Never mind.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840]   Does it slide in?
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   Does anybody know how to use this thing?
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.360]   I remember I haven't used it in a while.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   For good reason.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   Article.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.600]   Actually, let's talk about this Siri in just a second.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.120]   And it's a big birthday for text messaging.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   Oh, really?
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.760]   Do you remember your first text message?
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   Think about it, John.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.320]   We'll get back to you in a moment.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.320]   I think it was Watson.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   I wish it could be.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320]   I think it was Watson.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   Come here.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   I need you.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   I believe his answer.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]   The first received.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   Agist.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   No, actually I think-
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   Liberal ages.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.000]   We're pretty close to the same age.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.840]   By here's a little bit less.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.840]   What color is your hair?
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840]   Is it one?
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.840]   I wonder what myself.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.320]   Is it one color it is?
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   Is it one?
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.880]   You know, John's son is here and he's a spitting image.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.160]   It's kind of cool to see.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.480]   It's really neat.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.160]   That's how my son is about six years old.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   Let's talk a little bit about audible.com.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.920]   Any of you Audible book?
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.920]   Don't use that.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.640]   Anybody in the audience listen to Audible?
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   So I can-
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640]   Half the audience does.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.400]   Well, I think Audible is a really great solution for people who spend time commuting
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.840]   at the gym, doing laundry.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.880]   It is a great way to entertain yourself.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.160]   I'm going to actually ask you because I've been reading on Audible listening, I guess,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.560]   is what people would say.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.440]   The Neil Stevenson Reimdee.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.000]   I'm a little disappointed.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.520]   That's not an unusual reaction to it.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.560]   It doesn't feel like a Neil Stevenson book.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.560]   It feels like an early Neil Stevenson book that-
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.280]   He's a thriller.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.360]   Well, his first two or three books actually were fundamentally thrillers.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.160]   It's just in this particular one.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.440]   Tom and I got into an argument about this where I was like, "It seemed like he just
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440]   edited so much.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:56.600]   Usually he's incredible aside and it just seems so short and somebody immediately broke
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   in.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.880]   That's because you're a freak because it's a thousand pages and I burn so it-
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.040]   It doesn't feel short to me.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040]   I went through it in a weekend.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.560]   Anithm, I'll never read again.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.040]   I don't sleep when I'm reading a book.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.040]   It's an issue.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040]   It's uncontrollable.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.040]   It's been going on for 35 years.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.920]   It's my old band didn't break me up.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.040]   I'm surely not going to break myself of it.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.840]   I actually enjoyed it but it felt a lot softer than I expected.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.320]   I just didn't feel as smart as some of his other books.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.800]   It's a good thriller though.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.360]   If you like thrillers, you might want to listen.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.880]   I think he's trying to sell a movie script.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   That's what I felt like to me too.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.480]   I have to say the technology in it is all right on.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.080]   Reem D is a virus misspelled.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.960]   Read me, which I like.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.040]   It takes you all over the world.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.640]   There's terrorists.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.040]   There's all kinds of bad guys.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.960]   There are at least two twists in the book.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.000]   One at page 400 and one at page 700.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.560]   It opens up it as a Midwestern family reunion involving shooting which is taught when I
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.720]   were laughing hysterically over that and how accurate it was.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.720]   Really?
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.880]   There's the whole feel of a family reunion.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.600]   The Ryu they call it.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.000]   Thirty-eight hours and thirty-four minutes.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.520]   You could get this for free.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.520]   Really?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.520]   I'm going to give you two books.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.920]   You can get this for free in another book.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.120]   These play of course on all the iOS devices on the Zoom.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.720]   I guess I don't have to say the Zoom anymore.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.720]   The Windows phone.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720]   No.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.800]   You still use Zunes.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.560]   But the Zoom, yeah.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.440]   It's on almost any device around there.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.520]   The Kindle Fire of course.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.840]   So that's a great start.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.840]   There's one.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.760]   It's a video game developer.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.600]   There's a game that's like World of Warcraft called T-Rain.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.880]   It's actually, if I didn't know it was Neil Stevenson, I'd love it.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.320]   That's, I guess that's my problem is that it doesn't feel like a Neil Stevenson book.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.320]   But it's a pretty good thriller.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Now here's a book.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320]   I can't wait.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.600]   I just downloaded the new Stephen King.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.480]   I'm hearing great things about this.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   Anybody read that yet?
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.960]   The new Stephen King novel.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:28:00.400]   The idea is a guy builds a time machine and goes back in time to prevent the Kennedy assassination.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.480]   11, 22, 63 and the other.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.320]   This was a family guy episode the other week.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320]   Really?
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.640]   Stewie and Brian go back in time to change the initial, yeah.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.400]   You really think sure.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.720]   It's actually, by the way, it's one of the best of all the family guys ever because they
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.600]   kept cropping up trying to stop each other.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.520]   That's actually a very funny one.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.760]   This is, I'm going to take it back.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.560]   He doesn't build a time machine.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   He finds a secret portal to a day in 1958.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.200]   So he goes through it and then has three years or six years, five years to prevent the Kennedy
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   estate.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   Anyway.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   Can you go back and forth?
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200]   I don't know.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   I haven't read it yet.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   I'm very excited.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.480]   I've destined, my next read, 11, 22, 63.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.600]   Now you could get both these books for free.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.760]   Both of them.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.440]   That's 50 hours of reading, 60 hours of reading, 68 hours of reading.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.440]   Look, he did it.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.440]   Audible Doc, thank you.

[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.040]   That means you can cancel at any time and get two books.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.280]   And there's a couple for you, but there's, the real problem is there's a hundred thousand
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.280]   titles.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.280]   There's so much great stuff at all.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.760]   When are you going to read a couple of these books?
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.120]   Well, I'll be on a plane in France tomorrow.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   I'll have plenty of time.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   No, no, no.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120]   I mean, read the book.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.560]   No, I listen to the book.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.560]   No, I mean, be the voice.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.880]   This looks like a read one out loud.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.360]   Yeah, to be the voice.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   You have a great voice.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.160]   You should have been narrating a couple of these books.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   You've known this.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.240]   You've wanted wanting to do it.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.240]   I have wanted to do it.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.080]   I found out how much they get paid.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   Not enough.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.440]   Yeah, well.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.760]   It's not what you would call a great living.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.080]   Well, actually, you know, it could be a great living if you read a lot of books fast.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   You don't want to read fast.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.560]   This guy, holy crap.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.080]   This guy reads so fast.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:53.600]   That's the only way you can make anybody.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   Here's it.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:59.360]   By the way, the new Bill Maher book is called the new rule, the new new rules, a funny
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.080]   look at everybody, but me has their head up their butt.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.800]   You get that one free on top of the other two?
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   No, you only get two.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.640]   I'm just saying there's other choices.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.680]   It would be a better idea.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.080]   I think well, this one's only four hours, but it'd be funny.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.240]   So it depends what you're in the move for.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.640]   That's the thing as I like to keep.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.680]   In fact, I already downloading books for my plane fright because I want to have a variety
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:21.680]   of different books.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.440]   Why don't you sleep on the plane like most people?
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.440]   No.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   You always want to sleep, by the way.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.440]   It's your tip, everybody.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.320]   You sleep going east and stay awake going west.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.920]   So which way am I going when I'm going to France?
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   You're going east.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.920]   Okay.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.200]   So I should sleep on the way to France and stay awake coming home.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.200]   Exactly.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.200]   And then what?
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   Then you don't have the time.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.200]   You don't have the jet lag?
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.200]   Really?
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200]   No.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   Wow, that would be great.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:50.840]   Like it, the New York Times had an article about a problem.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:55.320]   People talking to their phone and it talking back.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.040]   It's bad enough.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.800]   People just talking on the phone, having phone conversations, but apparently it's become
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.120]   a real problem, especially on those quiet cars on the train.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.840]   They have the commuter Long Island railroad trains.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.920]   Partly because people when they talk to Siri talk in a robotic voice.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.080]   Have you noticed that?
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080]   You have to.
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.880]   It doesn't take up punctuation or intonation of your voice.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.720]   So you have to say happy birthday, comma, smiley face, comma.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.640]   The example I use in the story is how is he doing question mark?
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.240]   How are you doing question mark?
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:30.800]   You know, my kids, my family mocks me because when I dictate to Siri, I use intonation.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.920]   I say, hi Siri, how are you comma?
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.160]   I mean, I will talk.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.960]   And your kids mock you?
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   Literally?
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   Fine.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:40.960]   Fine.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.960]   They say, fly.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.000]   PAPPA, you are speaking with intonation to a robot.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.320]   And then it talks back to you.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.720]   Apparently this article says, talking to your phone is so new, there are no official
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.200]   rules yet.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.860]   Cliff Cola spokesman for Amtrak said that train lines quiet car policy bans explicitly
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.960]   only phone calls, not banter with a virtual assistant.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.520]   Oh, please.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.440]   We may have to adjust the language if it becomes a problem.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:14.240]   It is one of the problems though with dictating to your phone, and especially if it becomes
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.040]   ubiquitous, as I believe it will.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040]   And Apple's going to put it on the desktop.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.680]   People will be talking to their stuff all the time.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.920]   It'll be driving you crazy.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.640]   If you're lucky enough to use Amtrak to commute to work and B, you can get a seat in the
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   quiet car.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.000]   C, you should STF you and enjoy your quiet seat in the quiet car and not play head.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   You saw the board.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.200]   You saw the yellowed angry birds use headphones.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.200]   Right.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.200]   It's a quiet car.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.880]   But the woman got arrested for talking in the quiet car.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.600]   She wouldn't shut up.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.320]   They finally arrested her.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.320]   This is also a sign.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.320]   They arrested her?
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:46.320]   Yes.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.320]   That's great.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320]   She went to jail.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.920]   She was speaking in the quiet car.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.920]   Why can't we do that at movies?
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.920]   Arrest people.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.920]   Absolutely.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:57.920]   Let me see if I can.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:58.920]   Everyone shut up at the movies.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.920]   Let me see if I can.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920]   No laughing.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.600]   Did you use?
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.760]   Is this college humor?
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:05.760]   Where is this?
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.240]   Yeah, college humor.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.760]   You've seen this maybe you haven't.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.760]   It's awesome.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.920]   Do you have audio?
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.920]   We have a flat tire.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.720]   How do I tie a bow tie again?
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.640]   What's the fastest way to Hartford Hospital?
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.440]   Tell my wife I'm going to be 30 minutes late.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   Tell her yourself.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.560]   Tell my wife if she has a problem with my work schedule, she's more than welcome to
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560]   get a job of her own.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   Tell her yourself.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.280]   Tell my wife that if watching Ellen is a job, she should get a promotion.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.960]   Message from your husband.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:36.960]   I appreciate you.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:37.960]   Bullshit.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   What did he actually say?
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.880]   Please don't drag me into this.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880]   It's cute.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880]   It's cute.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   I want to call for my picture.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880]   It's really cute.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.680]   Tell my husband that he said he'd respect my choice to stay at home with our child.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.640]   Tell my wife I would, but she can't even get around to washing his overalls.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.720]   Did you want me to search for flower shops nearby?
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:57.600]   That's what I said on the washing machine.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:03.080]   I said my wife this picture, ask her if your washing machine is the only thing you've
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.080]   been sitting on lately.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.080]   Oh dear.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.640]   Ask my husband what he means by that.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.480]   Tell my wife I think she knows.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.000]   Hey look, I googled anger management techniques.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.080]   Very carefully before he says whatever he's about to say.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.680]   Ask my wife if she's Jim McPherson.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.680]   Tell my husband how dear he.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.400]   Tell my wife that's not an answer.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.400]   Is this my fault?
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.160]   Tell my husband that I will not answer that.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.360]   Ask my wife if she's...
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360]   Okay.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:36.200]   Tell my husband he wishes it was just Jim McPherson.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.200]   Okay.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.720]   We can stop here.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.560]   How did you get the idea?
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.560]   There you go.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.000]   We'll produce you.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.600]   You did this at the studio, right?
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.680]   Yes, at the collegehumor.com.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.280]   One last story that we're going to wrap this thing up.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.280]   No way I got a story.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.280]   I got a story.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:55.280]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.760]   I just ran into the story that just came through.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.200]   U.S. postal service plans to slow down first class mail.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.720]   This is their solution to the problem.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.720]   You know it's just fast.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.720]   Let's slow it down.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.720]   It's just...
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:05.720]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.960]   But read the lead graph before you completely...
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   Slow it down.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.960]   How?
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.960]   Slow it down.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   The U.S.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.160]   plans to save $3 billion by slowing down the delivery of packages, letters, and other mailing
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.640]   using first class postage.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.320]   So how's that going?
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.320]   How's that save money?
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   Well because then everybody...
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   Here's the letter.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320]   Hold on Lee.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320]   I'll give it to you tomorrow.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.320]   That'll save money.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   You know what?
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.920]   This is exactly why the postal service is in trouble.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920]   Hold on, hold on.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920]   He's not reading this story.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.560]   He's not reading exactly right.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560]   Okay.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.200]   First of all, they're talking about cutting $3 billion.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200]   Would you agree that...
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.200]   It's bogus.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   It's bogus.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.880]   But why are you cutting money by slowing down service?
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.520]   No business does matter by making their service worse.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.000]   By the way, these guys are making money.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   So let's get to this.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   Are they making money?
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   They don't...
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   Why are they...
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   What's the problem?
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.400]   They had to pay out their retirement benefits for the next 75 years in advance.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.480]   The $50 billion or whatever was that.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.200]   And the whole thing is designed to privatize this thing so the...
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.200]   Right.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.200]   They privatized it.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.200]   That's what the...
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.200]   I mean, this is...
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.200]   That's what they already did.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.200]   Well not completely.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.200]   Well they want to fully privatize it.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.200]   Yeah, this whole thing.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200]   It's interesting.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.600]   It's the current standard for first-class delivery has been in place since 1971 which
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.120]   is one to three days and they're now going to slow first-class delivery to two to three
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.120]   days.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.480]   And how is that going to save $3 billion?
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.480]   What's the logic?
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.480]   Well and not only that, they're going to lose business.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.480]   They're going to shut down $250 or $500 million.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   Well that's different.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.480]   That's different.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   But that's the same buy slowing down.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   But they're closing up.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.520]   But they have here as a great deck.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.520]   And it's sucked you in the title.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.040]   It's sucked you in the title.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.440]   The title says what it is.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.160]   They're going to slow down service.
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.160]   I think that's angry.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.160]   And save $3 billion.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.960]   And close 250 processing centers and lose all those jobs.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.600]   Including the Petaluma Processing Center which is going to be closed.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.600]   What?
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.600]   Yes.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.600]   They're closing our...
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.600]   Scamos and airposers.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   And you know what's going to happen next?
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   It's kind of like throttling bits.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   They're going to get you...
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.920]   If you want overnight delivery, you're going to have to get overnight delivery.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.040]   I wish I were doing a stamps.com ad right now.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040]   But I'm not.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040]   So Mark.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.040]   Head to the advertisement.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.040]   No we have a stamps.com ad.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.040]   It's just not on this show.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.040]   This should be a perfect show to give.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.040]   I'll go ahead and do it.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.040]   Because you don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.040]   You go to stamps.com and then post office.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.040]   You're giving it away, Leo.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:11.040]   Well the Postal Service ran commercials saying...
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.040]   Don't use us.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.040]   You...
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.040]   No, well use us.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.040]   Don't use email because it's insecure.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.040]   Yeah right.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.040]   And it's slow.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.680]   It just seems counterproductive to make your service worse to save money.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.160]   Because in the long run you're just going to lose more business.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   Right?
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   That would be an issue.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   That would be a problem.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.120]   And isn't that the ultimately the real problem?
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.440]   Not that you're going to save money.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.760]   But that you're losing business to FedEx and anyway.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.640]   You did an interesting thing.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.160]   You made a book.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160]   I wrote an e-book.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   Steve Jobs' email messages.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   How's that going?
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   It's going well.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   It's been out for a little over a week.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160]   It's...
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   Where can we find it?
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160]   Two 99 on Amazon.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   You're making money.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160]   Two 99 on Amazon.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.160]   You're buying it.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.280]   It's called Letters to Steve.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:04.880]   And it's the last 14 years of Steve Jobs' life told through his email interactions with
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]   fans.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.880]   Some of these we know we've seen.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   But this is just stuff we've never seen.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880]   There's a couple of exclusive Z talks about...
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.320]   So can I ask you a question?
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.720]   Technical question is a writer.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   Uh-huh.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.640]   So these are letters to Steve.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   And from.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   Two and from.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.600]   And ones that he replied to.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.880]   And the writer of a letter technically owned the copyright to that letter.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   That's a good question.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:33.560]   And they share it with blogs and then it's been pushed out.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.320]   I just wondering if you're...
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.240]   Well, the ones that I got exclusively for the book were shared with me.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.240]   By who?
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   To be published.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.240]   By the recipient.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.240]   By the people who...
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.240]   By the people who sent him.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.240]   So I...
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.240]   That's not a natural question.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.240]   I think you're going to sell a lot of books.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.240]   That's an interesting question.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.240]   It's one of those interesting questions.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:51.240]   Okay.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.240]   So I send you an email.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   You're not sending anything in there.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.240]   But you got it.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   So can't you...
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240]   You can't give it to somebody else?
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240]   No.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.240]   Not unless I'm a publisher.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.080]   And then it's assumed that's a letter to the editor that's opened to public domain.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.360]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.160]   So just because you have letters.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160]   Private letters.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160]   If you...
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.160]   This isn't a private letter.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.200]   These are emails sent to his apple.com address.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.000]   Well, then you could make this assumption.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.600]   But if it's a private correspondence, and I would assume he gets private correspondences
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.920]   on occasion, it's illegal for you, the recipient, to republish that stuff.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.720]   Now, it happens all the time, obviously.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.720]   It happens all the time.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.000]   And he was asked about why he's sending these emails.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   If you're...
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   Right.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   If there's a public figure, he knows they're going to get published.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000]   Well, no, he doesn't.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   In fact, it's...
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   No, he doesn't.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]   No, he's not alive anymore.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   He knew at the time.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.120]   I don't think he's writing anymore.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.200]   Is he writing more?
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.680]   Well, depending on what fiction writer you're talking to.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.600]   No, but that's interesting because obviously he knew people were going to publish these.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.440]   Maybe not at first, but they were so rapidly published, he must know.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.200]   And it was actually a very clever way of communicating with...
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.920]   Indirectly with the Apple fan base.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.320]   Yeah, I think it provided some good PR for him at times.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.680]   He handled customer service directly at times.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.720]   People would send him an email and say, "My laptop has been tied up in the genius bar
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.720]   for a month.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.880]   What's going on here?"
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.960]   And then he would have the laptop fixing overnight at the next day.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:15.200]   Did you get a sense of Steve Jobs maybe a little different from reading these emails
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.640]   than you might have gotten from other public announcements?
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.640]   Yeah, I mean...
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.040]   Is it more personal?
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.720]   I think at times there's one where a guy sent him an email and said, "I want to thank you
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.800]   for supporting organ donor programs.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.920]   My girlfriend of two years died of melanoma."
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.120]   And it really affected me and he wrote back, "You're very welcome.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.000]   I'm sorry for your loss.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   Life is fragile."
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.720]   It was a very honest moment.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720]   Interesting.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   He had very few of those.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   Was the worst moment, I think this was the worst moment, we was calling back and forth,
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.280]   was it where the writer from Engagit?
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.280]   From Gawker.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.280]   Gawker, that's right.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   Yeah, Ryan Tate.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.560]   Yeah, and at one point he says, "Well, what to Ryan Tate?"
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.560]   After Ryan complains about the fact that Apple's blocking porn on the iPhone, Jobs'
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.400]   retort to this is, "Well, what have you done that so greatly?"
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.600]   Yeah, or do you just feel a little work of others?
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.640]   Kind of a low point, actually.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.680]   Often he'd end with zingers.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.440]   One of the ones I got exclusively for this was from the guy who runs Tap, Tap, Tap, they
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.480]   do Camera Plus.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.880]   And he sent Steve an email saying, "You know, there's a flaw in the App Store system.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.500]   You should fix this.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.920]   People are gaming your rating system."
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.080]   And Jobs responds like saying, "Here's the fix that we're working on.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.520]   By the way, I see your app hasn't gotten great reviews."
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.120]   Oh!
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.920]   Camera Plus actually is one of its best sellers.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:37.920]   That is a weird zinger.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.760]   Well, it was a different app at the time.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.760]   It was a couple years.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.760]   Oh, it was a camera plus.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.760]   Geez, that's kind of personal.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.760]   By the way.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.120]   It's a very rocket people get this book.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.120]   Well, right here, Amazon.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120]   Amazon, just the Amazon.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.120]   What's the deal on that?
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   Does Amazon take 30%?
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:52.640]   Yeah, they take 30.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.800]   I wanted to actually price it at $199, but $299 is the lowest you can go before they
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.640]   start taking 70%.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.040]   Oh!
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.080]   So that would be the kind of sweet spot.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.200]   You get two bucks for every book.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.560]   But they also take a book for his books.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560]   What books?
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.560]   When's the last time you were in the book?
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.560]   I don't know.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.560]   That's not open for debate.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.560]   It's not open for debate.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.320]   I don't want to talk about it.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.920]   I got books that backed up.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   It's a problem.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920]   You got books backed up?
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.920]   Wow.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920]   That must feel good.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   I need those big pockets.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:33.840]   Anyway, letters to Steve inside the email box of Apple Steve Jobs is available for Kindle
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.560]   at Amazon.com.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.720]   And they let you enable text to speech.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.040]   So you can have a robotic voice reading it to you, which would be very interesting.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.360]   By the way, somebody's already written a book called Talking to Siri, learning the language
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360]   of Apple.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:49.840]   That did not take long.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840]   $4.99.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.280]   That's what's interesting about these ebooks is how quickly you can turn them around.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.080]   Well, I was working on this one for about eight months.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.320]   Maybe I couldn't do it on work time, so it was probably just because I was working on
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320]   the weekends.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.920]   But once you get to the publishing phase, it's much quicker.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.560]   You don't need to wait for printing press to get to it and marketing and everything.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560]   Right.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.560]   You just press Go.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.560]   It's available.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:16.840]   Two Wikipedia, the first text message SMS message was sent.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:26.240]   Third December, 1992, 19 years ago, a man named Neil Paffworth used a computer to text
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.480]   to Richard Jarvis.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:33.160]   He was a Vodafone customer on an Orbital 901 handset.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.520]   The message was, and I quote, "Merry Christmas."
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.520]   First text message.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.520]   Unbelievable.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.560]   Here we are 19 years later.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.000]   And look how far we've come.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:52.840]   In 2010, SMS messages generated $115 billion in worldwide revenue.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.840]   Wow.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.840]   Does that do?
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.840]   Look at that.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.840]   That's the one of those things that you'd have to keep here.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   I could put it over here.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.200]   One of those things you'd have to keep on your shoulder with a shoulder bag.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.200]   The thing is so big.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.200]   Can you see that?
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.200]   Look at that.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.200]   Wow.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.840]   But I don't think text.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.920]   When did you look?
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.160]   You're a young guy, Mark Millian.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.000]   Did you, in college, you surely used text messaging.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.400]   How about in high school?
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.040]   I didn't have a text messaging plan, and they were like--
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.040]   It was expensive.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.600]   You couldn't do it from cross-carrier.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.440]   And the real problem was on those old flip phones, you'd have to type AA--
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.440]   1-1-1.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.600]   So I think it was probably 2000.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.000]   I would guess it was when the iPhone came out in 2007.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.320]   Or maybe Blackberries that text messaging really took off.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.320]   Blackberries, for sure.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320]   Blackberries, yeah.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.320]   I had a lot to do with that.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:48.640]   And then I think it was 2009, maybe, when text messaging had surpassed the amount of minutes
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.240]   that were spent calling.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.640]   And it's not changed since--
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.800]   Huge revenue source for cell phone companies because they charge--
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:58.560]   Even if you pay a flat fee, they charge an awful lot for those.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.200]   I use Google Voice for my text messaging.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.200]   I do.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.200]   Love it.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.200]   It doesn't cost you anything.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:04.200]   Right.
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.200]   But the recipient pays if they have a plan.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.200]   I don't have a plan.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.680]   And you can't get multimedia messaging or messages through--
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.240]   From Google Voice.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240]   From big companies that--
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.240]   Right.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:16.440]   You know, those-- if you're texting American Idol or something.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440]   Right.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.440]   Oh, really?
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.440]   You can't do that.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440]   I don't think so.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440]   I had vote with Google Voice.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.400]   It's a bot with bang, bang, bang, and something.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:29.720]   I think the interesting thing is that Google Voice, Apple's iMessage group services, we're
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:32.800]   going to use GroupMe for CES and L'Oeb.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.520]   They all bypass SMS, giving you SMS capabilities.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.520]   iMessage is very-- I can't believe Apple got-- it's a testament to the power of the iPhone
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.800]   that Apple was able to get the carriers to agree to this.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.640]   It will use Wi-Fi or data over SMS.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.320]   It'll only use SMS if there's no other way to send that message.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.280]   And it has a combined inbox.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.720]   So you don't care or no.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:55.720]   I got the text.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.720]   I don't care how it came.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720]   I doubt the carriers are happy about that.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.720]   They cannot do anything.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.600]   But everyone was doing it with BlackBerry Messenger long before iPhone was.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.520]   High school kids love BlackBerry Messenger.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   Someone in the chat room wants to know when the first sexting message was sent.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.520]   It was December 4, 1992.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   Yeah, softball.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.520]   You hit it.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.520]   It worked.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.320]   I mean, the Phil texted back, "F you."
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.200]   Okay, so I think we are done now unless you have any urgent stories that anybody wants
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.320]   to cover.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.880]   We have some food to eat in the back.
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.880]   More twizzlers.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.880]   Mm.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.440]   Sweaty-colm sweaters?
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.440]   Red vines.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440]   Red vines.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440]   John C. Devorek is at ChannelDevorek.com.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:39.040]   This is where you find out his many enterprises, including No Agenda Show.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.960]   Go to GenTheShow.com.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.280]   Take five.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   Take five.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   No.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   No, no, no.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   That's the Merit.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280]   X3Show.com.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   X3Show.com.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:54.400]   And if more funny, your Generation X3 Show.com, which is something you'd like to do.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.080]   You know, speaking of Tom Merit, I think he actually...
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.080]   Is Tom going to be here?
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.080]   I think he's here.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.080]   He's got something on the...
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.160]   Oh, it is funny because I've been wanting to ask him a question.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.160]   Tom?
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.680]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be talking about on Tech News today in the
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.680]   week ahead.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.600]   Of course, today, December 4th, your white galaxy S2 skyrocket for AT&T is there.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.360]   I know you're so excited, John.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.560]   Also Mario Kart hits a 3D yesterday.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.760]   On Tuesday, December 6th, Microsoft confirmed the revamped Xbox 360 dashboard we'll launch,
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.680]   and they also have an event to unveil the Windows 8 App Store.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.440]   On Tuesday, December 7th, the $900 HP Folio 13-inch Business UltraBook lands, and Friday,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.520]   December 9th, the status hearing on the Department of Justice's case against AT&T's acquisition
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.480]   of T-Mobile as finally going to happen.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.440]   Saturday, December 10th, the Nintendo 3DS Slidepad add-on is official and ships in Japan, and
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.280]   the Sony Android Walkman Z launches.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.400]   No time to talk, John, but thanks for listening.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:56.000]   I guess he doesn't have time to answer your question.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   Excellent.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.560]   Tom Merritt, we'll be filling in.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:02.480]   He will be staying here while the rest of us go to Paris.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.400]   So thank you, Tom, for doing that.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.880]   Again, if you go to inside Twitch, or blog, inside.twit.tv, you can see our schedule for
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:10.880]   our low web coverage.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.200]   I hope you will watch that.
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.840]   We want to thank you, Mr. Patrick Norton, the head of Tekzilla.com to find out more,
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.360]   or as Veronica the head, and you're the torso.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   Are you the heart?
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.360]   You're the soul.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.000]   You're the winner of the introducing Tekzilla and making the best program we can.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.840]   And sometimes it rains.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:31.840]   Yes.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.160]   Make it obscure, bolder.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.160]   I got it.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.520]   I got it.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.120]   And sometimes it rains.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.760]   Yes, sir.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.960]   Catch Mark Millian at CNN.com, where he writes about Tek.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.720]   Anything else you got besides the book and CNN?
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.200]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.920]   I've eaten quite a bit of my time in the last year.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.600]   Well, hey, thank you for coming to Accu.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   Thank you.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600]   Yep.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   I guess we're up.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.600]   Thank you for coming up.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:03.720]   We do this show 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2300 UTC on Sundays at twit.tv.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.640]   We love it if you watch live.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.640]   We follow the chatroom and all of your insulting comments there.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.040]   We really appreciate those.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:16.600]   If you want to also watch after the fact, you always can by downloading a copy from twit.tv.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:17.880]   We make audio and video available.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:18.880]   And now, high def.
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.400]   We still do the high def, right?
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.840]   If you haven't downloaded the 720p version, take a look at it.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.080]   It really is gorgeous.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:28.200]   You might even be able to tell what color John C. Dvorak's hair is.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.600]   No, I'm sitting there.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600]   It's unlikely.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.600]   I still can't tell.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.200]   I don't know what color it is.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.200]   Sandy.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.560]   Sandy, the Sandy John C. Dvorak.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:39.560]   We'll see you next time.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560]   Another twit.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.560]   He's in the can.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:54.080]   Hey, thank you.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.400]   Blackberry's rim.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.400]   It's back.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.920]   No, it's not.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.080]   It's all coming up next with twit.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]   Blackberry's rim.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.240]   I'm sorry I screwed it up, didn't I?
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.240]   Huh?
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.240]   You said carry it ID.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.040]   You carry it.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.840]   Okay, take two.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.440]   It's time for twit John C. Dvorak is here along with Patrick Norton and Mark Millian from
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.440]   CNN.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.380]   We're going to talk about carrier IQ.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.520]   How much do they know?
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.920]   And when did they know it?
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:27.600]   SOPA, the motion picture association of America says, "Oh, we can fix that."
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.600]   And rim.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   It's blackberry.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.240]   No, it's not.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.400]   I made no sense.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.880]   Was it all right?
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.880]   *Laugh*
