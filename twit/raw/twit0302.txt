[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.700]   Mr. Peter Rojas from gadget.com.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.800]   Hey Peter.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.500]   Hey.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.000]   How's it going?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.500]   Good to see you.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000]   Nice. How's everything going at gadget?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   You just had a big party in San Francisco.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.600]   We just had a big party in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   and then we relaunched the site about a week ago.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.400]   Oh, 2.0, that's right.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.700]   Yeah, just put it out.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.000]   Looking good.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   Yeah, it's come a long way.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.300]   And the response from people has been really, really positive.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.700]   And you're going to have iPad kiosks on every story now, right?
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.000]   I'll explain what I mean when I get to the news.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.100]   Also joining us from Houston at blogs.cron.com/techblog,
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.700]   Mr. D. White, Silverman.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.900]   Hello, Dwight.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.700]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.200]   How are you?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.000]   Very good.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.600]   Good to have you on again.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I want to introduce a newbie to our midst today.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.200]   Kevin Barradad is the CTO of Johnson School of Business at Cornell University.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   And a long time guy in the tech world, you, when you sent me an email,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.400]   you said, I have sat in the judging chambers of Comdex with Devorek many a time.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.900]   Yes.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.800]   Pull your mic up there real close.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm sorry to say those mics have to be in your face for them to work.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.500]   So what brings you out here, Kevin?
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.700]   Oh, I came out.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.000]   I had some vacation time to use.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.500]   So I came out for Maker Faire.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.200]   Oh, I love Maker Faire.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.500]   We had a little coverage last night.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yes.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.500]   Spent the day there yesterday.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   Sarc attack.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.300]   And it was really great to see all the people learning how to solder.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.900]   Isn't that me?
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.900]   Make things and guys and utila kilts and the steam pog folks.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.400]   We went to Maker Faire Detroit and they had a utila kilt booth.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.700]   I almost bought one.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.100]   My friend Patrick, as you know, is a there's there's skirts.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.700]   There's skirts.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   Well, anyway, it's good to have you.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   Welcome to the show.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   Thank you.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   He sent me an email saying 10 the top 10 reasons why I should be on Twitter.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.000]   I was so impressed.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Ladies and come in.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   So story number one and this is the iPad kiosk story man Apple keeps pulling me in every
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.520]   time we saw the rumor earlier in the week that Apple was going to something big was going
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   to happen.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.720]   The Apple store employees were being told to stay overnight on Saturday night.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.400]   We knew that the 10th anniversary of the first Apple store was this week.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.120]   So it was presumed something having to do with the 10th anniversary was going down.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.840]   They said black curtains will be going up.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.920]   Lots of people will be in.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.040]   So what is it?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.680]   It's Apple store 2.0.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.720]   Basically they've rearranged the store and they put iPads at every place and you can
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   pray.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   Oh, and you don't have to wait for somebody to come and help you.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.880]   You press a button like a like ringing for the butler.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.520]   It wasn't the big news that they're bringing everyone in to let them know they were fired
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   and being replaced by iPads.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.600]   That would have been a good story.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.800]   It reminds me of poncho's at restaurant where you raised the little flag to get more into
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   lads.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.480]   I don't know if Steve Jobs would really enjoy that description.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.840]   Yes, now more like poncho's.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.680]   You know the last time I was in the Apple store just after the launch of the iPad 2,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.000]   all of the geniuses were running around with little claws and every time somebody would
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   put down an iPad 2 they'd have to wipe it off because all the finger grease.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.280]   And so I wonder how that's going to look at the middle of the day when they're going
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   to have to run around and wipe everything off because that gets kind of nasty looking
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   after a while.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   Let's think of those kids in the mall with the sticky fingers in the.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Yes.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   So there's the button talk to a specialist.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.280]   Would you like a specialist to come over and answer your questions?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.440]   Yes, no thanks.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.480]   Every device will have a little iPad kiosk right next to it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.920]   I think that's actually is a good idea from a retail point of view.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   I was in the San Francisco store just yesterday morning and it was so crowded.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.520]   Oh, it's amazing with people milling around.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.280]   I happened to be up walking around being on East Coast time.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   And so I got on the line and got my chit for an iPad and came back later and it was just
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.200]   a madhouse just after 9 a.m.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.560]   Was that 2.0 or is that still the old the old Apple store 1.0?
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.360]   No, I guess it's still the old one.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   Was it last night they're going to do the challenge?
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   How can you change over?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.120]   Yeah, no, just packed with people.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.440]   Still phenomenally successful.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.240]   So congratulations Apple.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Wow, just.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.040]   Although, you know, the ideal thing would be is you're standing next to a product and
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.880]   it's got that little iPad next to it and you tap it and you shouldn't really, I guess,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.000]   even need a clerk or help.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.080]   You just say, I want this tap and one comes down from the ceiling and right.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.600]   And then it comes down from the ceiling or from, you know, one of the the roving Apple
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   store clerks.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Yeah, here's your iPad.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   You're right.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.040]   Yeah, why should we ask a need a specialist?
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.640]   Just give me an iPad right now.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   Give me one.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640]   Jingle.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   Better yet, it's waiting at the door.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.160]   Your house, it's there.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160]   Just go home.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   Go home.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.440]   Actually, there, you know, there may be something to this.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   This was the week of the Rapture.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.200]   I noticed none of you were picked up.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   You're all still here.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.040]   No, I came back for you guys.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.080]   Oh, I realize I had to quit.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   He takes his commuariously.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Glad you put your clothes back on too.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.160]   No, it, you know, was a minimum requirement, I think.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.840]   Yeah, you got to have some clothes.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   So this in Wapshire week, I think it's appropriate to mention this BBC story.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.600]   The BBC had a documentary in which they do.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   I like these.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.240]   This new technology is called a functional MRIs.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.680]   You could do MRIs of people while they're actually, you know, thinking about things,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.720]   doing things, and you could see how the brain is responding to stimulus and so forth.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.320]   And this FMRI is kind of amazing.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.720]   You know, you can, you can tell all sorts of things about how people are thinking.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:42.880]   So this documentary apparently did an FMRI of Apple brains, Apple fan brains.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   They ran a test on an Apple fanatic and discovered that images of the technology company's gadgets
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.560]   lit up the same parts of the brain as images of the deity do for religious people.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.440]   Is this a surprise to anyone?
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   No, not.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.240]   I mean, what would be more interesting is to see how the brains of Apple haters respond.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.360]   It's pretty funny.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.960]   There's been a video circulating for a while of Steve Jobs and the original Apple Store.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.640]   I think let me see if I can find it.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   Because when the Apple Store opened 10 years ago, Apple didn't have an iPod, an iPhone.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.560]   It was just Max.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.680]   It was just Max.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:32.320]   And you know, it's interesting because they did feature other people's MP3 players.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.760]   There's a woman here in Houston who's writing a book about sex and the brain.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   I think it's called Dirty Minds.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.280]   And she has a Facebook page called This Is Your Brain on Love.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:54.560]   But as part of her research, she basically gave herself an orgasm while in an MRI.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   Well, well, well.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.240]   And the story is a new scientist that she wrote you a story for it.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.680]   And she was able to get pictures of her orgasm.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   Of a climax.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.800]   Yes, in her brain.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   And does it look like an Apple?
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.160]   Exactly like Apple.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.120]   I suspect it's somewhat similar.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   Wow.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   That's, these fMRI's are very, very fun.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.000]   I mean, I, you know, these, I don't know how big a story this is.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   It's certainly not news.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   Anybody would know this.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.320]   Let me, let me show a little bit of this video.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   This was at Macworld.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.880]   Unfortunately, it's very low quality.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.440]   But at Macworld Expo, Steve Jobs giving a tour of the first Apple Store.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   What is that?
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   Tyson's Corner, Virginia.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.440]   Is that where it was in 2001?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.760]   2001.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.480]   And we're waiting for the video to load.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.520]   You know, in 2001, it never loaded either.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   All right.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.000]   This is, I guess, from an Apple keynote at Macworld Expo.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Hi.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Hi.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Hi.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Steve Jobs.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Hi, Steve.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   And I'm here at Tyson's Corner Mall in Virginia, right outside of Washington, D.C.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.240]   And I'm standing in front of this wood barricade we built in front of our first retail store
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.840]   that's going to open in six days.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   Did you think?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.440]   It's right, Peter, that Apple was crazy when they said we're going to go into retail.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   I know I did.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   Yes.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   Yes.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   Because of the gateway, the gateway was a fiasco.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.480]   I was going to say, gateway did a terrible job with their stores.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.240]   They were closing them at this time.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.000]   I mean, when gateway opened the stores, though, it seemed like a smart move, right?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.360]   Because it kind of helped them cut out the middleman with a lot of electronic stores.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.760]   You know, it's one of those things where it comes down to execution, right?
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.840]   I mean, it's not necessarily just the idea or the concept.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.640]   It's really about how you execute on that idea.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.080]   So I think anyone who's been visited a gateway store and visit an Apple store could see immediately
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.720]   the difference between the two experiences.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   Yeah, no cowboxes.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   They had Lenin.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.920]   Now, if this is kind of funny, I mean, this is all they had.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.480]   This was an IMAX.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.720]   We have our pro section with all our great pro products.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   Look at these whole pros.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.280]   Look at the size.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   You know what?
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   It jumps out immediately.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   It leads to the size of the monitors.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.720]   There's 17 inch displays of the big displays, you know, maybe 20 inches.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   They're so small.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   This is our newest iBook.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.160]   We've got iBooks on display.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.280]   Most of the products are running self-wrenching demos, but you can just walk up to them and
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.000]   start using them for anything you like.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.600]   That was actually a good idea.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440]   And that's one of the things that stayed true.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.280]   In fact, this whole iPad kiosk is more of the same where you can really, you can go to
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.800]   an Apple store and really try that stuff.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.320]   I think that's a secret of their success.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.640]   It's more like a high-end car dealership where you walk in and it's kind of the product
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.920]   is art.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.480]   It's interesting to see this because the Apple stores did not change much, at least in look
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   and feel.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   Obviously the material, what they were selling, changed a lot.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.960]   You see that with somebody else's MP3 player there.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   It was probably an Arko, so I didn't catch it.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.640]   Yeah, it looked like a big clunky one.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.240]   Well, do you remember they used to, before iTunes, they used, I think they used a music
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   match.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   That's right.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   That's right.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   They did sell a version of music match for the Mac.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   Yeah, then there was a...
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.560]   We're carrying six digital camcorders, six digital cameras.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   No, it picks 995.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   There it is, the Nomad.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   And six handheld cameras.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   Oh, the Palm!
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   Wow, a Palm!
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   The Palm!
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   The Palm!
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   All products that they've basically put out of it.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   Yeah, whatever happened to that creative Nomad.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.800]   Whatever happened to Palm?
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.640]   By a computer.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.360]   Or after you bought a computer.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.840]   If you had any questions, you could ask a genius.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.880]   Well, that's what we've got.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.840]   That's the most stupid thing.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.440]   The genius bar.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   Then I'm not crazy.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.360]   I'm not a genius, but I'll stand behind here.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   But people love it.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   I mean, people do.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.000]   You know, there are people who...
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.800]   I guess it does speak to normal people, doesn't it?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   Right.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   Yep.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.320]   Normal people feel like if you understand this stuff, you must be a genius, so it makes
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   sense to them.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   And that person doesn't know...
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   Wait, sure, it's white.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   Haha.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.320]   It's supposed to look like, "Oh, look, a hotline with a diamond.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   I'll tell you what I'll say."
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.920]   It does look like he's in heaven, doesn't it?
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.560]   THX 1138.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   Very sci-fi.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.160]   We've got an exceptional, weird projection.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   Not a lot changed.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.040]   And I think this is really what an Apple store today would look like, except for the products.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   Right.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.120]   And the TV sets may be back someday.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.680]   Do you believe that?
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.560]   Do you really think that they're going to do a TV set?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:29.760]   No, I think the experience that HP and Dell had, that's so low margin and so hard to do
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.400]   at the kind of margins that Apple likes to do it, I just don't think they could do it.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.800]   And it just makes no sense for them to do it.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.400]   With the possible exception of the notion that it makes it easier if it's all in one
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.440]   unit.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.480]   But other than that, I don't see any reason why Apple would want to do that.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.840]   Well, it was a big success.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.160]   Apple's 2.0 just got 20 minutes of coverage out of Twitch.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   Damn them.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   All right.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   All right.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   All right.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.320]   Here's the semi side.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.720]   The other big Apple story this week.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.680]   Apple users being badly bid, it seems, from this Mac defender of virus, which is very similar
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.720]   to a virus that's been spreading in the PC world, a number of viruses in the PC world
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.920]   where it warns you you've got malware.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.800]   You go, Oh my God.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.760]   It's I think it even says the Apple Security Center.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.360]   And but we have a fix downloaded.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.720]   Of course, you download it to give them a credit card and you're dead.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.160]   This is, is this the, what we've been waiting for all this time, the end of the age of innocence
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.240]   for for Apple?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   Interesting.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   Apple's response to this.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:45.600]   Apparently, Ed bot talked to an anonymous Apple care support rep who says we are not
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.400]   supposed to help customers remove malware from their computers.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   He also said that our phone lines are currently being jammed by mostly people with Mac defender
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.120]   problems.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.840]   Uh, you know, Apple says we won't, we won't fix it.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.920]   It's, uh, it's your problem.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.280]   Well, and that's in their terms of service.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.280]   The Apple care services.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.000]   The Apple care terms of services that they don't help with malware and to a certain extent,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.400]   you know, they have liability issues.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   If they start telling people, delete this file, delete that file, it can, you know, they
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.880]   can end up with more problems.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.680]   And imagine the length of that call if they start doing that.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   Right.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   Well, Microsoft does it.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.360]   Microsoft has a number that you can call specifically to help with malware.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   Right.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.600]   So, but they're set up for that.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.280]   I mean, you know, Mike Microsoft has a few years of experience.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   And, um, and so they're set up to do that.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.880]   But in this case, you know, Apple is kind of, I guess is going to have to learn from scratch.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.680]   Kevin, do you have a lot of Macs that you support at John's School?
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.120]   We're starting to across the university.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   There's quite a few.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.000]   We've been a kind of a PC only support area.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.240]   So you have a lot of malware experience.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   What do you, what do you do?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.160]   I mean, you've got to support students, uh, teachers, uh, and their computers.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.520]   Do you, how do you protect them?
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.000]   The student, uh, they have site licenses for various, uh, anti, uh, malware components.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.600]   That's what Apple's telling their, their customers is get so close or, um, you know,
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.640]   getting it for the students.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.120]   We don't do too much because they own those devices.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.920]   So we send them to a local service provider.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.200]   We do provide them some guidance, but in most cases, it's not worth your time to muck around
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   with it.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.840]   We just make sure the data is backed up, uh, check for identity information and then
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.600]   just wipe the hard drive, wipe the boot sector and drop a new image on it.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.640]   It's much faster and you know you got it.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.880]   What said that his, uh, anonymous Apple care representative told him that our call volume
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   here is four to five times higher than normal and the overwhelming majority of our calls
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.760]   are about Mac defender, uh, and it's brethren and Tigo who discovered Mac defender said the
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   same thing.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.880]   Now don't forget it, uh, Apple folks, in order to do this, you have to enter your password.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.000]   Apple's always been that way.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.600]   Uh, it's kind of like windows UAC only.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.360]   Um, even if your login is an administrator, you still have to give it administrator credentials
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.640]   to escalate to administrator.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.000]   And you know, there's, there's kind of this reaction from, um, some of the Mac diehard
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.680]   users, long time users who are saying, well, this isn't really, um, you know, the Mac
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.280]   apocalypse that people have warned about because you have to enter your, uh, enter this
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   information and it's an installer.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.760]   You know, you actually have to take action to put it on your, uh, machine.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.600]   But the thing is this is what most, uh, windows malware is now.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.040]   Uh, you know, the vast majority of spyware programs are these fake, fake anti spyware
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.160]   programs that trick you into, uh, installing them.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.120]   And so this is exactly what windows users are facing right now.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   The old paradigm of the virus or the, you know, the idea that you install something
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.040]   that has something else embedded in it that, um, that's kind of gone.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.400]   And now you have these, this social engineering based malware and Mac users are facing the
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   same thing.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.080]   This is created by a software kit that's selling among hackers for about a thousand
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   bucks.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.400]   You can just like a couple of clicks and you build yourself some Mac malware.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Uh, Brian Krebs, the former Washington Post security guy and still a very good security
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.160]   guy said, Oh, well, just Mac users just have to remember don't install software you didn't
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.920]   ask to install.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.440]   But I don't know if that's really adequate.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.560]   I mean, this is why this works.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.720]   It's social engineering.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.480]   They're tricking you into installing software.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.680]   You do want to install it.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.240]   You specifically click the button and said, yes, install it.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.320]   It's not, that's not the issue.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.520]   The issue is, uh, do you believe this warning and obviously people do.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   So they install it.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.200]   How do you teach, how do you teach people, especially Mac people who've never had this
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   to do this before, not to do this?
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.440]   Well, it's difficult, you know, you need to get, you know, touch the hot stove a couple
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   times.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   That's it.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Burn them.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.080]   Well, not burn them, but you, but you learn that you need to read and question.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.400]   We always tell our folks that if something funny happens or have any suspicious, give
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.640]   someone a call before you click on the button, but then, you know, people click so fast to
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.160]   make the screens go away.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   I tell people Google it.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.920]   I said, you know, I say, look, and I tell windows users this and I tell Mac users this.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.680]   I say, um, if you see something that says Apple Security Center, you have a problem by this
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.360]   or download this just, it's one step type, just Google in Apple Security Center.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.920]   Because if it is malware, you will see a thousand entries on Google saying, Oh, no, I installed
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   it.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.920]   Don't install it.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.920]   It's terrible.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   I guess if they're asking for your credit card number, yeah, the minute you get that, yeah.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.800]   That's when you close the screen out.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   And if you didn't initiate it, yeah, I mean, well, one of the, one of the problems with
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.120]   this is that there actually is a software program that's legitimate called Mac Defender.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.000]   Well, there, I think it's based in German.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   It's a German.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   It's not, it's not anti-virus though.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.440]   It's, uh, I don't think.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Some of the security program, right?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   Right.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   Right.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.080]   The other thing is that at least with a lot of Windows programs, when you get these popups
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   that say, um, you know, you need to scan and click here to do it or no thanks, a lot
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:21.760]   of times the no thanks button is also a yes button and or the whole window right top
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   up is a yes button.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.240]   And I don't know if that's how this particular thing is working.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   There are some reports and also dug up about 200 different threads in the Apple discussion
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.400]   forums in which people were saying that they, that they didn't think they actually installed
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.360]   this, that they just began getting these popups.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.800]   And of course, if you have Safari set up, it'll automatically launch friendly files that
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   you download.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.400]   So that may be what's happening.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   Right.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.440]   But, um, it's, it's, the initial attack was through a poisoning of a Google image search.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.480]   So you do an image search and the website that's serving the image, not Google, but the website
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.920]   where the image lived has been hacked and pops up this, this, uh, warning.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.480]   But I mean, we can, look, anybody who listens to this show is not going to get bit by this.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   I don't think.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   Probably not.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   Right.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.840]   So, you know, a radio show or when you do your radio showed white where those are those,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   those are the people we got to reach out to and say, Hey, just Google it.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   You know, be smart.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.400]   There's also this, there's also this large group of, uh, Mac users who are former Windows
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.120]   users who came over to the Mac side because they were running away from viruses.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.240]   They got viruses all the time.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.840]   And, um, and the reason they got malware, spyware and viruses to a certain extent had
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   to do with their behavior.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.560]   And so they get on the Mac platform and they think, Oh, I don't have to worry about it.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   Ah, yeah.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.000]   You know, and so the fact I have had Mac users who used to be Windows users tell me they
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.040]   switched because they could surf porn safely.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.360]   And that's just like astounding to me.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.440]   Uh, so, so you have this kind of setup where people are going, um, you know, oh, they're
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.760]   doing the same things that they did when they were Windows users and, and they're, um, they're
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   vulnerable.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   So, yeah, and I think, you know, just like Dwight saying, one of the problems is that,
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.280]   you know, Apple kind of leaned into that, right?
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.120]   They, they didn't discourage people from thinking that Macs were a lot safer than, um, you know,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.200]   than Windows PCs and by and large, they are safer.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.080]   I mean, there are obviously fewer viruses and things like that for Macs, but they're
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.600]   not nothing, you know, no platform is full proof.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.600]   And I, I think if people don't become more vigilant in the way that they use their computers,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.800]   you know, eventually you're going to have similar issues come up.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   Well, it's the end of the age of innocence for the Macintosh.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.160]   There's no, no doubt about that.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.880]   There was an interesting article in the unofficial Apple web log.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.760]   I think it was that, that's where I saw it, uh, where the guy, uh, did a little calculus,
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.440]   you know, because the question has always been, are Apple somehow safer because they're
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.360]   more secure or just because they're under attacked?
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.480]   And he said, you know, it's pretty obvious that just like Willie Sutton went, robbed
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.960]   banks because that's where the money is bad guys are going to go where the opportunity
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.480]   to make the most, you know, effective attacks are.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.720]   And you just looked at the raw numbers of windows users.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   It was always windows.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   It was, you know, not only was it easier, but it, but that's, that's where you make the
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   money.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.560]   But he says what's happened is as windows has become more secure, as users have become
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.520]   more sophisticated, he said, you know, an estimated 80% of windows users are now running
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   antivirus software.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.120]   They're, they're updating regularly.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.720]   They're no longer really that easily attacked.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:39.640]   That leaves only 20% whereas virtually no Mac users are protected in any way or know anything
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.320]   at all about security.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:47.480]   So that what's happened is that 20% of windows users that are vulnerable is now roughly equal
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.440]   to the number, total number of Mac users, which about 17% of the total.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.000]   So he says there's a line you cross at which point it becomes economically viable to go
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   after Macs.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.800]   And it'll probably continue to see saw back and forth and eventually the Linux people
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   will catch up.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.400]   Oh, you're just a fountain of light in heaven.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   That's, that's wonderful.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.160]   No, there's money to be made.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.640]   Someone will try and exploit it.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   Right.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.600]   And I think that it's the thing that's say to really say that's very clear is that anything
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   can be exploited if there's enough incentive to do so.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.960]   It's merely it's a matter of incentive and effectiveness.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.360]   And I don't think the Macs are more secure.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   It's obvious.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.640]   They're not more secure.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.360]   Even if you have to enter a password to hack your Mac.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.800]   I mean, to be fair, I have seen people make the argument that because OS 10 is based on
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.240]   Unix that it is fundamentally safer than Windows.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   You know, I've thought about that.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.000]   I've even I've made that argument.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.560]   But I think it's it's a marginally more effective.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.360]   Perhaps, but I've just I've I've seen, you know, security experts, you know, make that
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   argument.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.440]   I'll be honest, I'm not technically sophisticated enough to be able to judge that something
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   like that.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   It's more.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.360]   We also have to keep in mind the very first worm was for Unix.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   Right.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.880]   The KUKUZEG worm that's for Unix.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.360]   And so every every operating system is is vulnerable.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.600]   I think the reason that you might say the Apple's more secure is because it's based
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.680]   on operating system that was multi user from day one, whereas Windows was really never
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:26.320]   designed around security and that was an after the fact add on an XP and NT, which is
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.840]   now truly a multi user operating system.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.120]   And I think over years when Windows has become much more secure.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.800]   Well, this is a little bit different.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.560]   It doesn't matter how secure the underlying operating system is because the user lets
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.560]   them in the door.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:43.920]   And once you're in on the other side of the security barrier, anything's possible, especially
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.800]   when you ask them to put in their credit card and their password.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.200]   You know, one of the things apparently that this program is doing is you enter the credit
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.920]   card and says, no, no, that's wrong.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   Try another one.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.640]   And then another credit card says, no, that's wrong.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   Try another one.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.920]   So the idea is to try to trick you into entering multiple, not just one, but give them all
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.720]   your credit cards.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.640]   And I think a week I talked to people on the radio show all the time.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   It's not that they're dumb.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.520]   It's just that they're not thinking they're trusting and they do it and they give them
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   the credit card.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.000]   I had a guy last week called the show.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.320]   He said, I'm over at a friend's house, her computer was hacked.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   She's running Windows.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.640]   I ran the Windows scan and then I got a message saying, you need Windows, the Windows advanced
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.040]   module.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.160]   So I download, I bought that and download it, installed it.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.160]   So am I okay now?
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.560]   And I said, the Windows what?
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   He said the Windows, I said, there's no Windows advanced module.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.560]   What are you talking about?
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.560]   I said, did that cost $79.95?
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.160]   He said, well, as a matter of fact, it did.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.080]   And everything started working again.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.720]   I said, I felt bad because his friend that he came over to help is sitting right next
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   to him.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.280]   And what I have to tell her and him right now is your buddy just downloaded the virus
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.880]   and put it on his computer.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.640]   You just emasculated the guy.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yeah, the poor guy.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.560]   He ain't getting laid tonight.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   Well, I got a call a couple months ago from the credit card company asking if I had purchased
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:13.080]   $1,000 worth of perfume in the last 15 minutes, I called my mom and I said, it's not for me.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   But yeah, they caught it, but I have a card I just use for web transactions.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   And so if that doesn't go through, I don't complete the transaction for the reason.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   That's smart.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   That's smart.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.840]   And it has a fairly low limit and the bank does call if something weird happened.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.040]   But Kevin, you're sure you didn't buy $1,000 worth of perfume?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   No, I did not.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   It wasn't my central.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   He smells good, doesn't he, Leo?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.080]   I'm just I'm sitting in the room with him.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.440]   I just want to say you smell mighty fresh.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.720]   Well, it's the barbecue sandwich from the pedal.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.880]   Oh, you know, to me, I think, and most guys, I would think would agree is there's no better
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.480]   perfume than barbecue sauce.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.760]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   That's a good flavor.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.040]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.960]   We have a it's great to have you in Kevin Baradet, who is a an actual person on the
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   ground dealing with technology, CTO at Cornell's Johnson School of Business, graduate school
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.880]   of management, sorry, management business difference.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.040]   No, not really.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.600]   It's all the same.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   Great.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.400]   Very famous, very great school and really nice to have you in here.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.880]   Also Peter Rojas from GDGT and Dwight Silver.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.920]   And actually when we come back, Peter, I want to ask you because you deal with cell phones
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   a lot.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:32.000]   It strikes me that the real apocalypse is going to be when cell phones start to be hacked
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.440]   because they're just they're just made.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.720]   It started a long time ago, actually.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Has it really?
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   People were doing hacks via Bluetooth.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   Oh, snarfing.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   That's right.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.560]   Remember there was that whole scandal where, well, one, remember when Paris Hilton's cell
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   phone got hacked?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.120]   Yeah, but that was because she used her dog's name as a secret question.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   Sure.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   She did some--
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   She's your dog's name.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.760]   Obviously, stupid things.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.240]   But people were, yeah, we're snarfing and, you know, being able to like penetrate people's
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   phones via Bluetooth.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   And I remember writing about that like six, seven years ago.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   Right.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:15.000]   But yet there's not been a really good widespread mobile hack.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.480]   Maybe our mobile phone's more secure.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.920]   I mean, they're supposed to be.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.920]   They're trying to be--
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   They're trying to be--
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   I mean, yes and no.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.520]   I mean, I think it's-- people-- it depends on the platform, right?
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.560]   I mean, if you look at--
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   Amosploid.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.320]   --you know, Android, which is more open.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   And there have been instances of people, you know, creating apps that, you know, fish
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.640]   for people's personal details and things like that.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.160]   Passwords, et cetera.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.400]   Well, I just-- I know.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.080]   I just wait for the day that we do a tweet.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:49.320]   And instead of saying, oh, Mac Defender, we're saying, you know, the big Android virus is
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   sweeping the world.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.080]   And it can cost you a lot of money.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.440]   I mean, it's not merely getting personal information now.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.320]   They can send text messages for 25 bucks.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   There's all sorts of stuff they can do.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.400]   Or run through your contact list, and that's worth money.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   At RSA, there was a-- this year, there was a session about cell phones, and that cabbies
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.520]   get paid when they find a cell phone.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.200]   They get paid a certain amount of money if they find a cell phone and turn it over.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.680]   They get paid more money if as soon as they find the cell phone, they pull the battery.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   So you can't wipe it or--
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.840]   So you can't wipe it.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.040]   So they know to go to a corner somewhere.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   Wow.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.640]   So they roll up, hand the cell phone out the window.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.120]   They get paid cash.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   And then the people take it into a shielded room and fire it up and set the contacts out.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.280]   It's not the cell phone they want.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   It's the data.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   It's the data.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:47.440]   Because people have contacts, passwords, credit card numbers.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   Wow.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.000]   Don't lose your cell phone phone.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   No.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Wow.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.200]   So maybe it is happening.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.560]   It's just not making the news.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.960]   Before we go on, I want to talk a little bit about our friends at Ford, the Ford Explorer,
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.240]   and our show Mostly Photo.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.440]   I'm really glad I can give you a little plug for our Mostly Photo show.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.880]   It's every Tuesday we do a live 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv with Lisa
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.320]   Bettany, Chris Markwater will be our guest.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.160]   What we've been doing is we've been bringing in great photographers to show you their photos,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.960]   give you tips.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.120]   I just really enjoy it.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:26.360]   And I'm really glad to have Ford as a sponsor, the brand new 100% reinvented 2011 Ford Explorer.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.080]   I think one of the reasons Ford wants to be involved because the Explorer is just like
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.560]   the perfect family vehicle for photographers and people want to go on adventures and go
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.560]   on treks.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.760]   It is a sweet, beautiful vehicle.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.880]   We've been driving explorers at all our photo walks.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.240]   Of course, it has the available sync with my Ford Touch with the big 8 inch screen in
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.600]   the console, the two screens behind the steering wheel.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.800]   Simply the best in car entertainment, navigation, phone call system out there.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.040]   And we also want you to go to our Mostly Photo Adventures website, mostlyphotoadventures.com
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   because every week we have a little vote on our pictures submitted by our listeners and
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   viewers.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.760]   And you get to vote as well as the judges get to vote.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:17.120]   If you go to mostlyphotoadventures.com and click the link that says finalists, you can
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.720]   find out about how to submit your picture.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.920]   You can see who the finalists are and then see the Twitter tag that allows you to vote.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   This week we've got Tress Chapin, CMR, Tega and Visual Ideas, three amazing landscape
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.800]   photos.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.880]   And we want you to pick your winner.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.480]   Lisa will pick her winner.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.560]   And each of you will get a $100 gift certificate from Amazon.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.440]   Thanks to Ford and the 2011 Ford Explorer.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.760]   This was our winner last week.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.320]   This is a really sweet picture.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   Just love it.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.920]   Isn't that great?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:52.400]   The one the week before was I think a prize winner from Kenny L. This was actually taking
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.600]   it our New York photo walk.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Lisa did a photo walk that started at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.760]   These guys are at a wedding.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.200]   The photographer was on the photo walk, ran over and took this picture.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.840]   I just think it's a classic.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.720]   It looks like a straight out of Vogue.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.200]   Just a really fun picture, mostly photoadventures.com.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.120]   And thanks again to Ford and invitation to visit your local Ford dealer and try that
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.080]   2011 Ford Explorer.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.520]   Best in class V6 highway fuel economy.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.920]   The sync with my Ford Touch.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.680]   It is just spectacular.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.800]   I ended up with a Ford Focus 2000.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   I can't wait.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.280]   It's nice, isn't it?
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   Yes.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.720]   I was very, it's probably the best rental car I've had.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.680]   I already sent a Twitter tweet to Scott Monty at Ford.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.800]   Because I already said, but I'm waiting because I want to get the 2012 electric focus, right?
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.880]   So I'm really excited about that.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.280]   It'll be out probably end of the year.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.720]   I already sent a tweet to him saying, "Can you help me out?"
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:57.560]   He said, "Well, we might have some for select editorial to drive in the summer.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   I'm crossing my fingers, but it's a nice car."
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.120]   You got the gas one, but they have gas.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   They have a hybrid.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.400]   They have a plug-in hybrid coming and then they have electric coming.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.000]   They've really done a nice job.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.960]   We're really glad to be associated with Ford.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.680]   Not only is it prestigious.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.880]   I just think I like what they're doing.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.280]   I think they made a good...
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   They rivet.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.680]   They did the pivot.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.800]   And so few companies are able to do that, you know, to go from being a 20th century,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.600]   even a 19th century industrial company into the 21st century is not easy to do.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.480]   Not at all easy to do.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.960]   Speaking of cell phones, this is not a tech story, but I got to mention it anyway.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:47.560]   A woman on a train ride from Oakland to Salem, Oregon.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   You're laughing.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.320]   You already know what I'm going with this.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.840]   You already know what I'm going with this.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.120]   So she gets on the train.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   It gets...
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:00.920]   Amtrak has a kind of quiet car that you can go into.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.560]   She goes into the quiet car, pulls out her cell phone.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:14.040]   For the next, get this 16 hours blabs loudly on the cell phone in the quiet car.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.880]   I want a phone with that battery life.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.240]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   The first thing I thought was that.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.360]   How did she do it?
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.960]   Why didn't someone pay off the conductor to turn the power off?
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.440]   Let me tell you something.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.480]   This is the train coming in.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.360]   Somebody shot video into Salem, Oregon.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   Two squad cars.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   This is a big arrest about that.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.240]   Go down here.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   This woman, they've announced in the car several times, you're in the quiet car.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.360]   She apparently got in a verbal altercation with the people in the car who said, "Shut
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   up."
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.600]   She said, "You're disrespecting me."
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:56.080]   She stayed on the phone talking loudly for 16 hours at Salem, Oregon.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.480]   They took her off the train and arrested her for disorderly contact.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.400]   A poor woman.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:07.640]   I got to say, "Right on!"
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   Why is it, Peter, maybe you know, why is it people talk so loudly on cell phones?
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.920]   It's because they think that it's because they're having trouble hearing the person
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.080]   that they're speaking to and they think that being louder themselves will make it easier
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   to hear the person they're talking to.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   That is the first thing.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.600]   But the funny thing about cell phone conversations is that they actually did some studies and
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.560]   found that what makes them especially irritating is hearing just one side of a conversation
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.840]   is, "We'll bother people," whereas you are just hearing both people talking together,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.040]   it's much less annoying.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.360]   I think it's because of the discontinuity of hearing someone talk and then it pauses.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.840]   You're only hearing half of it.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   You're only hearing half of it.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.440]   If you're eavesdropping on a conversation, at least you'd have something to listen to.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   Exactly.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.280]   It's like they've shown that people are way less annoyed if you can hear both people
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   talk.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.840]   They're like, "We're not in the quiet car."
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.520]   In the quiet car.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.680]   I think one of the reasons why people talk louder, I've heard this, is that on a cell
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.400]   phone, you don't have the feedback from your speaker back to you.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.920]   You don't hear yourself.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.880]   If you're on a landline, you can hear your own, it's like having headphones when you
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.280]   do a radio.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.680]   You can hear yourself and so you're able to modulate better.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.480]   I think you don't get that kind of feedback on a cell phone.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.520]   There's side tone from the mouthpiece into your piece.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.520]   In a regular phone.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520]   In a regular phone.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.720]   It's something Bell Labs did many years ago when they...
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   Probably for the same reason.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.440]   For the same reason because people were shouting, "What?
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   I can't hear you!"
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.480]   And they found if you've had a little bit of their own voice into their ear, they talked
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   it in a more normal volume.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   What's wrong with Nokia?
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.680]   When did they do that?
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   What?
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.720]   Give me some side tone.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.480]   Because of feedback concerns.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   It may also...
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.720]   Well, it would use some...
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   Battery?
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.280]   It would have to redesign the cell phones.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.840]   So Peter, you had an interesting speaking of Nokia, an interesting article on gadget
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.840]   this week.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   I wrote it.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.960]   I would do a newsletter each week for the site now.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.520]   Suggesting that maybe Microsoft should pick up Nokia.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.000]   Well, it was less like suggesting that they do and more sort of trying to think about
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.400]   why they might do it.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.240]   Because the rumor went around earlier this week.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.480]   And I actually did hear from some people that...
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.560]   The two companies have been at least talking about the possibility.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.880]   I don't know how advanced it is.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   How much would Nokia be?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.680]   It'd be like $35 billion.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.680]   Or something like that.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   It'd be doable.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.520]   I mean, they would have paid a similar amount for Yahoo at one point.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.520]   That's right.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.960]   I don't know if that's a recommendation, but that's right.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:02.720]   So, but I think it comes down to Microsoft kind of recognizing that however you slice it,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.080]   all the growth in computing is going to be in mobile for the foreseeable future.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   And that's right.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   Microsoft just doesn't...
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.520]   I mean, getting Nokia to adopt Windows Phone is a big win.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.200]   But otherwise, I mean, they haven't gotten a lot of traction for Windows Phone and they
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.800]   don't have a dog in the tablet fight really at all.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:29.100]   Microsoft paid Nokia $1 billion to use Microsoft Windows Phone 7 in the Nokia, new Nokia
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.100]   handsets.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.240]   Although Nokia says they're kind of redesigning those handsets.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.400]   They're kind of not going to be what you expect, right, for a Windows Phone?
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.840]   Well, I mean, think that's the hope is that Nokia's going to bring in smart words for
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   these things.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.800]   Please redesign it, please.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   Do something.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.160]   I mean, the thing is Nokia, I mean, has historically been great at hardware.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   They have great engineers.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   They have great...
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.000]   I love getting the most out of the hardware.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.440]   I have an N8 and it's the greatest phone ever and it's the worst...
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.880]   It just feels like a 10-year-old operating system.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   It's a Symbian 60.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.920]   Symbian is even older than that.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   Well, I used...
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.440]   Yeah, I used Symbian when it was on the Scion 3A.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.600]   That was my favorite little PDA.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.080]   It's...
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   Nokia found out the hardware that you invest...
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.360]   If you don't really invest in your platform and take those big risks and sort of cannibalize
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.800]   yourself, that somebody else is going to do it for you.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.360]   So you think it's credible that this might happen?
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.600]   I think it's possible.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.040]   I don't think it's probable yet.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.240]   I think it's a huge amount of money to spend.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.400]   I think that Ballmer doesn't really have that sort of big strategic vision.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.520]   And it's also not really clear whether there would be enough value in buying Nokia when
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.720]   they already have them agreeing to use the OS.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.040]   One of the scenarios that I sort of was thinking about...
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.240]   I actually didn't talk about it in the newsletter, but is maybe they split off the dumb phone
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.840]   business from the smartphone business.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:56.680]   And Microsoft just buys the smartphone business and then sells the dumb phone business to ZTE
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   or some rising Chinese manufacturer.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.840]   And then it's a smaller deal.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.880]   It's still an international market fruit, the small phone, the feature phones.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.520]   Absolutely.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.520]   It's going to be smaller and smaller over time, but it's still enormous right now.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.960]   Well maybe, I don't know.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.280]   Microsoft's got to do something.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   I think that that's really the bottom line of your article is why these rumors are flying
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   around.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.800]   Microsoft is just dead in the water and they're talking about Windows tablets.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   Come on.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.960]   Well, I mean, one of the things they're going to do is they're going to bring Windows 8
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   to ARM processors.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.880]   Yeah, Intel had some interesting things to say about that.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.960]   Yeah, I mean, things are going to get ugly there.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.160]   I think Intel obviously is sort of feeling challenged by all this stuff.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.760]   And someone just posted in the chatroom, Intel 2 is dead in the water.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.920]   And Intel has been kind of left behind when it comes to mobile processors.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.400]   You know, ARM is really kind of dominating there right now.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.680]   Yeah, and Intel would very much like to get mobile, but the thing that scared them was
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.400]   the idea that Windows 8 might run on ARM.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.200]   Paul Onalini talking to analysts said that Microsoft would have four versions of Windows
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.760]   on ARM.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.120]   He says, "I believe Intel is still the only architecture at the chip level whose silicon
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.280]   runs every major operating system out there.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.040]   The ARM guys are getting a port to Windows, but what the ARM guys are getting is four
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.240]   ports to Windows.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.720]   Every operating system has to write to the chip.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.800]   With the writing of Microsoft, Microsoft is doing it for four versions of ARM vendors
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.000]   is like Android writing a multiple versions of the ARM chip."
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.200]   Are they four different versions or just four different SKUs?
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:43.520]   I guess what he's saying is because there isn't one ARM processor, right?
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.600]   So they'd have to write for different ARM manufacturers.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   Okay.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:57.640]   And you'd have to have, this is Windows for whatever, you know, Cortex, Windows for,
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.960]   I think this is fun.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.520]   In fact, Microsoft dismisses.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.200]   Yeah, Microsoft has sort of dismissed a lot of that stuff.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.640]   Here's an interesting question.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.920]   In your NA Leo, what is the processor?
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.880]   I don't even know, to be honest with you.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   Is it an ARM?
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.440]   Is it an ARM processor?
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   Should I open it up?
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.440]   Sure, it must be.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.120]   As far as it was anything else.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   It's got to be.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   Everything's an ARM.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   Right, well, what makes it interesting is if, let's say that Peter's idea comes to pass
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.440]   and you end up buying Nokia and then you also have a strategic deal with ARM, that could
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   be very interesting for both the Windows Phone 7 and the Windows 8 operating system.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.840]   It's a 680 megahertz ARM 11.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.120]   So it's kind of a low and slow.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.840]   It's not a very fast processor.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   But it is an ARM.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840]   But it is an ARM.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   Microsoft went back to the drawing board and they actually created something really nice.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   It's a very intuitive user interface.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   It feels fresh in a lot of ways that even iOS doesn't feel fresh anymore.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   I think the problems, they were a little late to the game and haven't been able to get
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   the support behind it.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   Some of that just takes time.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.840]   I think they've also done a mediocre job of marketing it just like they did a mediocre
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.840]   job of marketing soon.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   They're the worst marketers.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   They just don't understand marketing at all, which is baffling.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   If they want to spot things, really?
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   They've done a great job with Xbox.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.840]   I guess.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.840]   What is something really interesting?
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   There's a Twitter client for the iPhone called Maha.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   This is a Windows, I don't know how well this will work, but this is a Windows version
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   of the iPhone.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   This is a Windows, like a Metro OS, a Metro UI.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   It looks very much like Zoom.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   You can do black or white background.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.840]   It has that same kind of oversized font for the headers.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   Interesting.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   The menu swing away like it does.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.840]   It's really interesting.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   You're seeing people being influenced by that design.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   I find that really interesting.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.840]   Tuesday, Microsoft's got a big event in New York.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.840]   They're going to apparently show nine new Windows phones.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.840]   They'll finally get the Windows phone on Verizon.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   Is it Sprint that they're missing?
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   Verizon and Sprint.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.840]   Also, I suppose we'll be talking about their Mango update.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   Do you know anything about this, Peter?
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   I mean, it's going to have a bunch of --
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   Cut paste!
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   I feel like stuff like that coming to it.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.840]   Finally.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.840]   To me, the bigger issue is less what is going to be in the updates
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   and how are they going to start rolling them out successfully.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   One of the whole ideas behind Windows Phone
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.840]   is that Microsoft would have more control.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.840]   You wouldn't have the Android issue where phones are coming.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   Android 2.3 has been out for six months now or something like that.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   People are still putting out phones on 2.2.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   And then phones are not getting upgraded.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   One of the things that Microsoft promised with Windows Phone
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   is we'll have more control.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.840]   It'll be tighter distribution, and so we'll be able to roll out updates
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   more quickly.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   And that hasn't really happened as much as it's supposed to have.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   So that's the thing that I'm more curious about is when they announce this,
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.840]   what's the plan to actually getting the update out to as many phones as possible?
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   Well, and it's a double-edged sword.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   I think Microsoft was smart in saying these are the hardware standards.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   So most Windows phones are very, very similar,
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   but they all reach a certain level of functionality.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.840]   I think the amount of memory is about the only difference
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   and of course form factor.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.840]   But that's a double-edged sword.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.840]   As you said, Peter, if they don't take advantage of it,
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.840]   the disadvantage is there's no excitement.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   We've got nine new Windows phones coming out on Tuesday, but so what?
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   It's going to be very much like the existing Windows phone.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   There's no excitement, whereas every time an Android phone comes out,
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   there's a lot of buzz about, well, this one's going to have dual processors
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   or a bigger screen or higher res screen or whatever.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]   They're not going to be--
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.840]   Yeah, they're going to have to start.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.840]   I mean, they did promise way back when they announced Windows Phone
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   that they would eventually offer more flexibility to manufacturers
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   in terms of what they can do, what they can, you know,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   the processors and screen resolutions and that sort of thing.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.840]   But right now, they're very similar and I think that is intentional.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   It is intentional because they wanted to keep--
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   Wait, the fact--
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   They wanted to have a more consistent experience across all the devices.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   Kevin, you were going to say?
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Well, I don't think they'll be lining up at 6 a.m. outside the store
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   to get out to get to come back at 9 a.m. to buy them.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   Yeah, that's obvious.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   So, Gartner estimated that about 1.6 million Windows phones were sold
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   in the first quarter.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.840]   That's about--
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   It was about 500,000 a month.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   Compare that.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   That's about four days worth of Android phone sales.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   400,000 people.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   Yeah, it's not substantial by any measure.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   And I know that the numbers disappointed people at Microsoft as well.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   I think that they thought that the adoption rate would be a little stronger at this point.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.840]   And Microsoft has yet to give out its own numbers.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   You know, they haven't-- they have yet to say what--
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   They're kind of being like Amazon with Kindle.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   You know, they have yet to say exactly how many of these are sold
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   and that's not like Microsoft.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   Right.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   Usually they're trumpeting their--
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.840]   Well, you know why they're not saying them.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   Yeah, you know exactly why they're keeping that quiet.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   Right.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   Oh, and this is the-- actually, this is the death blow.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.840]   Angry Birds won't ship until June 29.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   It's been delayed.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   That's it.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   Forget it.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   Nobody's going to buy it.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   Did you see a roveo announced that-- what was it?
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.840]   200 million copies of Angry Birds have been downloaded?
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.840]   That's amazing.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   Several hundred million minutes a day.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.840]   And the CEO said, "Well, those are minutes you probably would have been doing anything
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.840]   with anyway."
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.840]   That's the time you would have wasted doing something else.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   200 million-- I can't-- that's mind boggling.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   That that many copies of anything have been downloaded.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   That's like Windows numbers.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   Amazing.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   And I think AT&T-- I've got a-- I've got one of the new AT&T, St. Lee Infuse,
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.840]   and it ships with Angry Birds on it.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   So it comes as-- yeah, Angry Birds is right on it.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   Angry Birds is the Microsoft Office of the Mobile Era.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   Right.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   I have that phone too, Dwight.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   What do you think of it?
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   It's a great phone.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.840]   Tell me more about it.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.840]   Dwight, you want to go first?
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.840]   OK.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   Well, it's a-- it's a kind of an oversized galaxy phone.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   It looks big.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840]   Is it four, three, or is it bigger?
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.840]   Four, four, five.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   Four, five.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   Almost-- yeah, it's almost a tablet.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   It's almost a Dell streak.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.840]   Yes.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   Although it's fairly fast, but I don't know about Peter where you are,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.840]   but in Houston, the HSPA+ network is horrible.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.840]   No, it's pretty bad here in New York too.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.840]   It's-- and I'm getting slower speeds with this 4G phone with internet connection
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.840]   than I am with my iPhone, which is terrible.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   So this is T-- this is T-Mobile or AT&T?
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   AT&T.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   AT&T.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   And it's the first Android mobile phone that is shipped that allows side loading.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   It actually has the checkbox that says get it from sources other than the market.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   And so you can check that and then you can just go ahead and download--
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840]   Oh, no, no.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   My phone's always done that.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.840]   AT&T.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   For AT&T.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   AT&T, right.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   Oh, good reason not to buy an AT&T Android phone.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   I didn't know they didn't have that.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.840]   I think they're changing the policy because they realize how stupid it was.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   No kidding.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.840]   They're getting old phones with it.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   They're going to go back to the old phones and change those so they do it.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   So--
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   Oh, good.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   That's why I always buy just the vanilla Google phone.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.400]   I really hate the-- what the-- actually, more than what the carriers do, I actually hate
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.200]   what the manufacturers do.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.240]   The UI, they put it-- especially Samsungs.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.840]   Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the Samsung stuff.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   And one of the things I do is-- and one of the nice things about Android is you can,
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   you know, add-- you can download and install your own--
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   Rooted.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.840]   --the launcher.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   Right.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.400]   So I usually do ADW launcher or launcher pro and you get a much nicer experience, much
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   cleaner.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   I love launcher pro.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   I haven't used ADW.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   But-- so you--
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   They're similar.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.400]   Okay.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.240]   You know, they're not interchangeable, but they're both really nice.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.240]   Anything's better than touch was.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.440]   The touch was 4.0 is nicer than touch was 3.0.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.320]   I'll tell you that.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.960]   Which is touch was 3.0 is on the infuse and touch was 4.0 I think is on the Galaxy S2,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.920]   which just came out in Europe.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.280]   So is this new phone-- your phone of choice right now?
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.800]   Peter, what do you think of it?
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.960]   So I've been using this.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.800]   You know, I've been-- the battery life has been really inconsistent for me.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.200]   Some days it's really good and some days it's not good.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.480]   And it isn't-- you know, I tend to use the phone the same way each day.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   So I'm not--
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   That's weird.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   --what the issue is.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   But it's so light given the size.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.600]   It looked really thin when Dwight was holding it up.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   It looked really very thin.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   It's very thin.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.240]   And you know, it's like I have the Dell Streak, the 5-inch Streak.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.160]   And it's like totally-- that's so different.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.320]   The Streak, you're like, oh, this is big and it just-- it just feels like too big to be
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.560]   a phone.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.120]   But the infuse, I mean, it fits in your pocket really well.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.440]   Typing on it is really nice because the screen is so big.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.720]   I put it next to somebody's iPhone the other day.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.640]   And the iPhone honestly looks like a kid's toy.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   It's dinky.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.280]   Next-- like I think Apple is going to have to come out with a bigger screen.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.360]   I think this is pushing them that way, isn't it?
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.200]   Because 3.5 inches is just too small.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.880]   I can't type on 3.5 inches, especially when you get used to typing on 4.5.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.040]   The iPhone seems small.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.040]   It's funny, though.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   It's like these phones are swelling a little bit by the time until somebody says, OK, stop.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   That was too big to me.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.200]   4.5 is the max, I think.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   We now know.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   You know what?
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.560]   I think Acer is doing a 4.7-inch phone.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.560]   Well, that's it.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.560]   And we'll see how that goes.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.560]   We'll see, right?
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.040]   And then there's the Palm here.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   And finally, we see an HPOS.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.520]   Now, anybody have a Palm here?
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.040]   Have a tiny little phone.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.840]   Peter, you got one?
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.640]   I've played with it, but I don't have one.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.040]   I'm looking forward to the Pre-3, though.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.520]   When's the Pre-3 coming out?
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.160]   I think in June soon.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   It's just, you know, I have to say for years I really resisted covering cell phones because
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.800]   I thought this is too gadgety.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.240]   These aren't-- I'm a tech journalist.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.720]   I cover computers.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.680]   And you know, but the thing is everybody-- a cell phone was something always that you
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   could talk about.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.400]   In fact, it was one of those things.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.160]   It was-- you know, normally you walk around in the real world, people don't talk about
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.320]   tech, only geeks like us talk about tech.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.920]   But when you go like into a radio station sales department, the one thing that we could
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.480]   talk about besides basketball games was your cell phone.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   What do you got?
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.920]   Well, I'll tell you, I get this.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.560]   And this was even before smartphones.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.680]   Now that these things are actually computers, I'm much happier covering them.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.640]   There's something to talk about.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   And it has exploded.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.160]   I mean, who cares about computers anymore?
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.520]   You said 200 million downloads of angry birds.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   There you go.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520]   That tells you something.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:09.120]   I think it'll be the point where there'll be as many phones approaching the number of
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.440]   people and it'll certainly be more than the number of computers.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.920]   So it's the Samsung-- it is the Samsung Super Amoled.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   Yeah, that's the one.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.840]   And a full suite of entertainment on the go, including media hub.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.000]   When I see that, why do they even put that in the selling points?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.200]   I don't want that.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   What is that?
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   It's crap.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.080]   That's their download service.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   Just hate it when they--
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   The media downloads it.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.120]   Yeah, when they announce this stuff like you want it.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.040]   So I'm going to tell you, the only thing I don't like about the infuse is the screen
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.560]   resolution, which is wide VGA.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.240]   And you look at a lot of the phones coming out now, like the Atrix 4G and the HTC sensation
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   have the QHD, which is kind of a nerd.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.440]   What are the numbers on those, do you?
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.920]   It's like, I wish I should know this by heart.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.120]   I should tell you me both.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.800]   The QHD-- someone chats can say, oh, 960 by 540.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.440]   Thank you to everyone in chat.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.440]   This QHD.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.440]   Chat.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.280]   And that's almost the same as the iPhone.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:18.000]   And so the HTC sensation and the Atrix 4G have that higher resolution display, and
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.640]   it looks really nice.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.320]   The infuse has that 4.5 inch screen, but it's 800 by 480.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.120]   And so the fonts just don't look as good.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.760]   It looks like we're going to go retina everywhere, right?
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.960]   Was it Samsung that announced this new super high DPI?
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.360]   That was just sharp.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.360]   Sharp.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.360]   Toshiba.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.160]   For the 10 inch display?
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.080]   Well, even for smaller ones, right?
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:45.840]   But tablets, we were seeing like 357 DPI or PPI.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.480]   And I guess on phones too.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.560]   Yeah, we will see it eventually.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.040]   And it's going to create challenges for people because you're going to have to start creating
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.520]   graphics, which are not pixel dependent.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   Right.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.080]   And I tell you, this is the thing that kills-- unfortunately, the kill is a galaxy tab
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:10.120]   because it's a great-- I mean, I'm actually in love with this-- tablet, the hardware
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   is spectacular.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.360]   But the OS just doesn't-- and there's not enough apps for it.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.840]   8 megapixel camera on the infuse.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.840]   Is it a good camera?
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   It's as good as the iPhone?
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.920]   It's with decent camera.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.320]   It doesn't-- megapixels isn't necessarily--
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   No.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   --makes a great camera.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   No, I think the iPhone is a gold standard.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.320]   It only five megapixels.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.640]   There's nothing even close as far as I can tell.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:43.960]   The thing I don't like about it is it's supposedly a higher quality brighter, AMOLED screen,
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.040]   but outside it washes out completely.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   I can't even see it outside bright daylight.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.200]   You know, the real thing is I'm not going to buy an AT&T phone.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.360]   I don't care what they make.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.760]   I just-- I'm just done with AT&T.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.040]   What do you use now?
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.680]   I actually love-- I know T-Mobile.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   Good luck.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   Don't get too attached.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   No, I know.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   I know.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.520]   The G2X though, I really love it.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:13.120]   But as with all these smart Android phones, battery life issue, although one thing I
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:21.040]   notice is interesting, the display is never anywhere near the-- it's very-- I think it's
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.520]   an IPS LCD display.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.680]   And it is very low power.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.200]   And I think that that's interesting.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:34.600]   It's always 5% of the total battery usage compared to any of these Samsung phones where
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.440]   it's almost always 50% is the screen.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.280]   It really uses up a lot of screen.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.120]   So it's an ice screen, but battery life is terrible.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   So what I bought was an external charger and a second battery.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.280]   And now I carry-- I carry my pocket.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.880]   Battery number two.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.440]   So I get through half the day and I pop it and I put in a new battery.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   And the reboot's good for it too.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.120]   At least you have the option of putting in another battery, right?
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.120]   Right, right.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.440]   Of course, if I lose it in a cab, I'm dead.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   You're dead.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:08.200]   I'm stuck with AT&T because I have a family plan.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   And for me to jump would be expensive for my whole clan.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.800]   But I saw the other day that Verizon's talking about doing family data plans.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.000]   So one of their-- I think their CFOs that it was inevitable.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.280]   I would like that.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.400]   I might jump to Verizon if that happened.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.840]   I actually wrote about this last year.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.640]   And I said that this is something that you have to do.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.320]   If you're going to have capped data plans, if you're going to give me five gigs a month
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.040]   and not unlimited, then I should be able to use that five gigs across as many devices
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.640]   as I want.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:43.520]   Whether it's a tablet, phone, whatever, I should be able to have the option to allocate those
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.400]   five gigs across as many devices as I own.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:53.360]   So I have to say the HSPA plus on the T-Mobile is not bad.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.120]   Now do you tell me if these are reasonable numbers, but I'm getting anywhere from three
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.480]   to six megabits per second download.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.320]   And upload is always at least 1.2 megabits and often as high as 1.6 megabits.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   That's pretty useful.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   That's pretty good.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   That seems good.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:16.240]   In Houston on the T-Mobile HSPA plus on some of their phones, I've gotten as high as 8-10.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240]   You know why?
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   It's damn.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.480]   No one freaking uses T-Mobile.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.520]   Houston's a pretty big T-Mobile town.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:31.480]   We've got a historically, the companies that T-Mobile has bought were fairly big in Houston.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.080]   And so it's actually a fairly big town for T-Mobile.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080]   What do you use, Kevin?
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.520]   Do you have Verizon Droid X?
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.200]   I like the Droid X a lot.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.520]   But you know that 4.3 inch screen is no longer the...
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.760]   You got to go to 4.5.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   I can't do it.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   I know your fun way.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   It's obsolete now.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   It's obsolete.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.360]   Invest a lot and run them till they die.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   Really?
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   But I would...
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.360]   This replaced the trio.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Oh, you do run them till they die.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   That's...
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   It relates to trio last August.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.160]   Verizon trio's 700.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.920]   You know, the third person I've talked to in three days, it had a trio.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.760]   I guess a lot of people kept their trios.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.360]   They were loyal to their trios.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.120]   Well, we ran our own exchange system.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.000]   And so we needed to have some devices around what people called and said, "I can't...
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.080]   Windows Mobile Sync is not working."
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   Oh, you're born, man.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080]   So it was a job thing.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.960]   Well, and then you get used to it.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.400]   You get used to the keyboard.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.280]   I had apps I needed to function on it.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.360]   Well, let's talk about the VIR.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.960]   And what is it, the WebOS 3?
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.560]   Are these gonna...
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.400]   Is this enough to save the WebOS?
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.960]   Is HP, which is having some severe problems on the desktop computer side?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.240]   Is this gonna be a good thing for HP?
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.680]   Have you played with a VIR or any of these, Peter?
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.440]   Yeah, I've played with them.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.280]   And you know, WebOS 3...
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.640]   Well, first off, WebOS was really promising when they first announced it.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640]   I loved...
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   I was a fan.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:06.680]   I think it's one of those things where they've just never really delivered quite yet, but
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.240]   it still feels really promising.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.080]   And WebOS seems like a really good user interface for a tablet device.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.600]   So I think a lot of people are looking forward to that.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   HP...
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.280]   Just for the same reason that Microsoft might be looking at Nokia, I mean, HP bought Palm
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:29.440]   for the same reason, which was if mobile is the future of computing, then you need to
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.360]   have a dog in the fight and you need to have more control of your own destiny.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:38.520]   And I think that HP saw the success of the iPad and didn't see anything in Microsoft's
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.280]   pipeline that they could use as an operating system and said, "Well, you know what?
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   Screw this.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.960]   We're gonna do for self."
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.280]   I look forward to what they do with the tablets.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.560]   I'd love to see a great tablet.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.960]   I think it's encouraging.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.880]   And one of the things that HP needs to do is to realize that you have to give people a
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.400]   reason to buy your tablet or you have to price them so aggressively that it's a no-brainer.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.280]   I mean, if I were HP, I'd be saying buy an HP laptop and you get a...
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   Free tablet.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.520]   You get a touchpad for $100 a ton or a bucks.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.240]   Just get them out there.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   You agree.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   Take your wallet.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   Very definitely.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]   Lose some money for a few years.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.840]   Do you use any...
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.000]   Does Cornell use any tablets?
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.800]   Do you have any interest in that?
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   Students have them?
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   You see them around?
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.320]   I see you kind of like your new IP.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.520]   See them around quite a bit.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.520]   I would...
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.840]   You know, I was thinking, "Is it a good choice for a student?"
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.280]   It just seems like typing on it.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.840]   And that's one of the things students do an awful lot of.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.680]   It just doesn't seem ideal.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.320]   For our students, probably not because they're so heavy into spreadsheets and things like
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   that.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.160]   But for reading and other materials.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   It's great for that.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160]   Great for that.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160]   And recording.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.280]   And recording all your books on there and record lecture notes.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.360]   The books are going to be tough because the publishers seem to be charging the same amount
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.800]   of money for an E-text book as they do for a physical one.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.240]   Because their costs really aren't the paper in the...
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.840]   And once you're done with it, they can take it away and there's no resale value on it
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:12.400]   where you may be able to get 25 to 50% of the purchase costs back at the end of the semester
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400]   for a paper book.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   Right.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.040]   So it really hasn't taken off.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.600]   That's an interesting point.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.400]   I did see that Amazon is not going to support the EPUB format as well as its Moby format,
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400]   which is very good news.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.480]   It means EPUB.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.840]   If Amazon doesn't do that, it means EPUB will be completely dominant.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.120]   And it's a good standard.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.480]   It's a standard everybody else uses, but you're still not going to see textbooks on EPUB.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   Kevin Burredett is here.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.720]   He's CTO at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   Yes.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   Great to have him.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   Thank you.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.440]   Long time observer and of the tech world.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.440]   Back to Comdex.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.120]   But is it PC Expo you mentioned?
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.120]   Yeah, Expo.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   Wow.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   Tech Expo.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.520]   So what was it like working with the VORAC on those Comdex awards?
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.360]   It was kind of, it was a lot of fun, especially when it would get down to the end and people
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.320]   would start arguing for their, you know, advocating their choices.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.360]   It would typically, you know, you'd divvy up into teams and each team would get one of
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.000]   the areas that their award is being paid for.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.240]   And so your team picked their winner and then each team then presented to the group
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.600]   as a whole and advocated for like a best in show.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   Right.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.680]   So it was a lot of fun.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.120]   Very often Peter, you know, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter would run the judging.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.400]   And so he would bring in the hair voting system for proportional voting.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400]   What's that?
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.080]   The more hair you have, the bigger your vote.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.400]   Now it's where you rank, it's ranked voting where you rank one through ten.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.720]   So you really only need kind of one ballot to rank your winners.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:58.040]   So if your primary one doesn't rank, your vote still counts because you may pick a second
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.960]   one that ends up at the top.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.480]   So yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.980]   Seeing some of the small companies that started up and their various strategies, guys who
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.260]   would come in and say, we got a neat product, we figure we've got two years before the
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:16.720]   majors see what we're doing and you know, when I think run it out of the business,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.960]   on the cost.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.320]   So we're going to do what we're going to do.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.740]   We're going to make as much money as we can.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.660]   And when the it gets to the mass market, we're going to fold our tent and go on to
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.300]   that our next idea.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.300]   So they weren't looking to.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   We were honest.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300]   Build an umpire.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:36.700]   When I think of the tech, tech TV, the best of Comdex awards or yeah, I think it's
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.980]   the best of Comdex a couple years in a row, three or four years in a row.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.500]   And I think of the winners, I think, boy, you know, this is not a good system.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.740]   One year it was the danger sidekick.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.660]   One year it was the Moxie player.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.660]   Remember the Moxie?
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.300]   This was a competitor to replay and Tivo.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.300]   No.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.500]   Paul Allen's company.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   Yeah, it was Paul.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.700]   Well, it was pre-Paul by buying it, but it was the guy who did Web TV.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.300]   Oh, what's his name?
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.180]   That created Moxie with his Web TV money, the Microsoft bought it.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:13.740]   And, you know, we just, it's so hard to pick something that actually goes on and succeed.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:18.100]   Well, you can only pick what's from what's in front of you and what looks interesting
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.980]   and new and fresh and.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.820]   That's the problem is you get excited about the new and fresh when often the same old,
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.380]   same old is what ends up making money.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.540]   Well, sometimes things take root and other times they just wither or give someone else
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:34.860]   an idea and gives them the missing piece they need to build on top of.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   We're going to talk more.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:40.260]   I've got some big news about, you know, it's turning into this week in cell phones, more
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.420]   cell phone to send me Android news and more.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.540]   But it is, after all, that's where everything's happening.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:48.540]   Before we get to that, though, I would like to thank our friends at Carbonite for sponsoring
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.540]   Twitch.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.860]   Carbonite is that great backup solution backing up to the cloud.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.660]   And you know, any backup solution's going to have a few, in my opinion, a few features.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:58.660]   Absolutely critical.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.100]   There's a lot's got to be automatic or you, you know, you just won't do it.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   If it doesn't happen automatically, you're not going to remember.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.420]   Carbonite is always backing up.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.060]   I really like that.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.740]   So you're, you know, once you do that initial backup of all your data, and by the way, it
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:15.460]   is every bit of data on your personal, you know, your personal data on the internal drive
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.140]   at the same price, no tears or anything.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.140]   You don't have to worry.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.980]   Oh, I'm backing up too much.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.740]   Fifty nine dollars a year, less of five bucks a month for everything on your internal drive.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:29.220]   And then once it's backed up, it's just kind of constantly kept backed up every time you're
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.220]   online.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.100]   I love that they allow encryption.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.660]   Of course, it's encrypted 128 bit SSL.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:36.460]   So you don't have to worry about being in an open access spot or anything like that, but
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.580]   they allow additional encryption using strong encryption.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.580]   Only you hold the key.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.740]   So your data is private.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.340]   Then here's a beauty part of it.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.500]   Your data is always accessible.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.180]   It's cloud storage as well as backup.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:50.340]   So wherever you are, you don't have to wait for disaster.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.380]   You can log into your carbon and account on any PC or Mac or any iPhone, Android phone,
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.780]   Macberry, blueberry, yellowberry.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:03.140]   And there's your data available to you so you can access it, edit it, download it.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.740]   If the worst should happen, you lose a hard drive.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.420]   You lose your computer.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   Your data is still good.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.180]   And you just get that new computer, log into your carbon and account, say restore and
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.180]   it's all there.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.060]   It's really kind of miraculous.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:16.740]   And it is the most affordable, most effective solution out there.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.380]   Mac or PC, just fifty nine dollars a year.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.380]   Somebody did the math.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.100]   That's 16 cents a day for peace of mind, for sleeping well.

[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.340]   months when you use the offer code TWIT.

[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.140]   Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.780]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   So do it right.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.780]   With Acarbonite.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.540]   Do they have an app for phones?
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.540]   You know, they should.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.540]   They don't.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.780]   Moving on the radio show this week, actually, about backing up his phone.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.020]   If it said iPhone, that's automatic, right?
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.020]   Android phones, a little more tricky.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:08.860]   You might have to get an app if you want to do more than just what Google allows.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.860]   That's a good idea, though.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.020]   They should probably do that.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.940]   Why, do you lose your phone?
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:16.940]   No, but it might be useful with the outages and some of the cloud services that have been
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   seen recently.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.340]   It might be nice to have it backed up in more than one location.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.340]   Good point.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.340]   Good point.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.820]   Good point.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.420]   This is a little scary for those of us who use Android phones.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:39.940]   97% something like that of Android phones are vulnerable to leaking data with the release
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:44.420]   of Android 2.34 Google patch that security hole, but so many phones are not upgraded.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.980]   It means that millions of phones are, yeah, Kevin's pulling his hat and looking at it.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.980]   I can tell you right now it ain't 2.34.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.980]   It is 1.23.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:54.980]   We'll see.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.780]   Unless you rooted it.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.780]   No.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.380]   It is a fire sheep like sidejacking, excellent.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.460]   It steals an authentication cookie.
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:09.500]   So it allows somebody to basically log in as you without having your password.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.980]   Are you all right?
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.540]   Verizon says I'm up to date.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.940]   Of course, Verizon wouldn't up to date with what?
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.940]   That's the problem.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.980]   It is that the 2.34 Google releases it, but does Verizon put it out?
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.580]   No, it takes quite a while.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.620]   If you get on Google's site and read through Google like, we fixed that months ago.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.780]   Go talk to your carrier.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780]   Right.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:39.820]   Well, and also Google has fixed this in a kind of a smart way.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:44.500]   They've patched it on the server side so the connection is forced to be secure on the
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:49.860]   server side rather than pushing down an update and forcing the carriers to do it.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.820]   They just fixed it on their servers.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.660]   So at this point, I think they're lucky that they can do that.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.660]   Yes.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:02.460]   So you don't have to worry then because the log is now our SSL.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:07.620]   Still, that's the kind of news that Facebook paid versus Marstaller.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.820]   A lot of money to spread.
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.180]   That's not necessarily true when it was at RSA, one of the things they were talking
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:22.780]   about is in Eastern Europe, some of the criminal enterprises has infiltrated some of the cell
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.980]   phone companies.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.100]   And so they're putting on the phone company?
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.740]   No, but they put up rogue cell sites and grab the traffic and then pass it on to the
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.740]   real site.
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.780]   And so they have the potential to look at what you're doing.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.220]   Do you need rogue towers?
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.660]   Oh, I've heard about this.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.300]   But I've never heard about it actually ever happening.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.740]   It's theoretical more than I think it's more of a I mean, it's possible and you just don't
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.740]   know.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:56.180]   But it's like when they put out those fake ATM machines and get you to swipe your there
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:58.660]   was one of those a few blocks from my house actually.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:59.660]   Really?
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.660]   How long was it there?
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.060]   Did they say it wasn't that?
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.580]   I mean, I found out about it because it was somebody on the local blog kind of was posting
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.180]   photos of it and it got taken away.
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:15.740]   But it looked like, I mean, it looked kind of fishy, but if you're just like drunk and
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.300]   you're drunk and that was funny.
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.740]   It's two in the morning.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.260]   You're going to pop your card in and then it's not going to work.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.340]   And then you're just going to go find another ATM.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:31.180]   I guess is how I want to go down the road.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.980]   Netflix in the news Netflix, according to TechCrunch, although there may be some disputing
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:40.540]   of this is now the single largest source of internet traffic in North America.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:48.060]   29.7% of peak downstream traffic up from 21% last fall is the success of Netflix streaming
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.420]   obviously.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:53.980]   Do you block that on your network, Kevin, to Johnson?
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:54.980]   No.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.700]   You allow people to watch Netflix?
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.700]   Sure.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.020]   It's the purpose of research entity.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.020]   Thank you.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.020]   It's the purpose of the internet.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.020]   Correct.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]   Right.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:11.020]   I might need to watch, I don't know, Michael Douglas in Wall Street to learn from the best.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.460]   I mean, there are certain networks that do are filtered because of production systems
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.980]   and things like that.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:23.060]   But for the most part, it's controlled through education for the students.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:29.580]   This story comes from Sandvine, which monitors internet traffic.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:38.820]   Sandvine says that HTTP traffic, 18%, BitTorrent traffic, 11%, YouTube, 10%.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.700]   This is during peak hours.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.460]   Netflix, 29.7%.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.460]   Wow.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:53.100]   We're watching and no wonder there's bandwidth caps from AT&T and Comcast.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.340]   We're watching a lot of video.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.780]   This red bar here on the right is real time entertainment streaming video.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:08.260]   The green one, peer to peer file sharing, a lot of people doing this, I guess.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:15.700]   Web browsing, number three, then real time communications, I guess I am.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.700]   Not chat.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.020]   Bulk entertainment, which is, I guess, downloads 2.8%.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.020]   That's us.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.300]   We're the pink thing there.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.100]   It would be interesting to see those numbers instead of just raw traffic transactionally.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:33.420]   In other words, I'd like to see how many HTTP connections are made versus how many peer-to-peer
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:39.380]   connections are made versus how many people are actually grabbing Netflix content.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.540]   I think that might be an even more interesting chart.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.460]   Do you think it's how long before there's a backlash among internet service providers
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.980]   or will they just finally say, "Well, this is what you want.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.620]   This is how you pay it for."
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.980]   I don't think it's a backlash.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.100]   I think it's going to be profitable for them.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.980]   I think it'll end up being tiered because of it.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:04.780]   People who do more video are going to end up paying more.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.420]   That'll help pay for the infrastructure.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:09.380]   I think that's ultimately where things are going.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.020]   All the ISPs have said that they're looking at that heavily.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.980]   Usually when they say they're looking at a way to make more money, they're not kidding.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:25.820]   Miramax just signed a deal with Netflix to put its movies on their Netflix streaming.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:30.220]   According to Stacey Kramer running and paid content.org, it could be a $100 million deal
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.900]   to the studio.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.900]   Netflix is obviously doing well.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.460]   They're buying content like crazy.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.900]   They're saying, "We're going to salvage shows that they're dying."
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   Pretty impressive.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.140]   They're trying to lock this stuff up because they know, I mean, they're going to see some
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.500]   real serious competition sooner or later.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.500]   Am who?
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   Amazon?
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   It might be from Amazon.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.380]   I've heard Microsoft is planning something.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:58.100]   I think that the studios are Apple, perhaps.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:04.060]   I think the studios are recognizing that if they don't want to have one dominant player,
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.900]   have so much control over the market because then they're going to start to have to be
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.300]   all set their own price.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:16.980]   The studios want to be able to play a bunch of different players off of each other.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:21.220]   The truth isn't the key word of the internet.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.020]   Disintermediation, eliminating the middleman.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:31.300]   Doesn't it make sense that the studios like musicians before them and podcasters are just
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.740]   going to go straight to their customers?
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.260]   What do they need HBO for?
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.340]   What do they need a cable company for?
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.100]   Why don't they just go direct to their customers?
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.980]   What do they need Apple or Amazon for?
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:47.340]   They don't control the final distribution pipe to the customer.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.540]   The internet is the final distribution pipe.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.980]   It's about discoverability and about getting paid.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.380]   The reason why Netflix works is because you pay eight bucks a month or whatever it is
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.820]   for monthly streaming.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.340]   You have that service.
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   It's one application that you can use across lots of different devices.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:14.180]   You don't want to be a situation where I have to go and use some filmmakers or studios
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.260]   app to be able to watch the movie I want to watch.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.020]   You want a single point?
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:25.660]   You could look at the Comcast Universal merger as a lot of that being involved.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:33.140]   They have already indicated they want to do things with apps and with streaming.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:38.260]   I think you're going to see other companies probably make a play for an internet service
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.940]   provider as well.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:40.940]   Interesting.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:46.780]   Really good article that I recommend from IT World, Kevin Fogarty writing in here.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:52.260]   Talking about whether Netflix is swapping the internet, ISPs of course state that they
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.140]   are highly congested because of all these people watching things like Netflix.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:04.820]   That's why AT&T has 150 gigabyte a month cap on its DSL, 250 on its universe.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.380]   It's why Comcast has a 250 gigabyte a month cap.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:16.300]   It turns out, according to this, because of the way Netflix does it, Netflix content is
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.260]   cached, distributed and cached ahead of time.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:24.220]   In fact, it doesn't hit the ISPs anywhere near that much.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:29.340]   It turns out Netflix, according to Sandvine, same people who did this original port, Netflix
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:37.380]   users take up an average of 40 gigabytes a month from streaming media.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:48.180]   Twice that amount of bandwidth used for streaming data to an Xbox or a game console.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:52.180]   The problem is that if you are watching, I don't know why it's more in an Xbox.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.060]   Maybe it's higher quality.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:58.100]   If you're watching on an Xbox, you could be using 80 gigabytes a month for your movies
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.300]   out of the 150 gigabyte cap.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.980]   Well, the ISPs have incentive here, right?
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.420]   Because they want to be able to say, "We're getting slammed.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.940]   Our users are using Switch Bandwidth.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:10.940]   We have to charge more.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:11.940]   We have to offer tiers.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:16.860]   We have to start instituting caps and things like that."
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.740]   When there is an argument that, "Yeah, you guys just need to be managing your networks
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.580]   better."
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:27.340]   It eats up the bandwidth quickly, but your ISP will be there to make sure you don't go
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.340]   over.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.740]   You pay $10 for every 50 gigabytes you go over the limit every month.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:35.820]   That's the cost of allowing the FCC to avoid limiting the price gouging plans ISPs impose
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:41.820]   on consumers and small businesses rather than seeing through the smoke and realizing it's
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:46.380]   not compensating for Netflix that is taking up most of the carriers' R&D and network
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.380]   upgrade work.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:51.380]   Basically, it's saying something I've said a long time, which doesn't cost the ISPs
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.380]   that much.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.900]   They're using it as an excuse.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.140]   It's a little complicated.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.100]   I'm not an IT guy.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.420]   If you're an IT guy, read the article and you could tell me what it means because I don't
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.780]   understand it.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:07.940]   It sounds like he's saying conflicting things here.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:13.980]   Let's see here.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:18.220]   The playbook.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.940]   Anybody excited about that at all?
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:25.060]   BlackBerry playbook sales missed targets by over 90%.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:29.660]   RIM is saying that story is nonsense.
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:32.500]   How many are they selling really?
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.500]   I don't know.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.780]   I think that they were going to announce numbers really soon.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:44.940]   I don't know if they're going to blow out the doors or anything with the sales.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:50.780]   Even though there isn't a lot of overt enthusiasm, I see a lot of people on our site on gadget
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.300]   who are enthusiastic about it.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:58.500]   There are definitely people who are really, really passionate about BlackBerry who are
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.100]   waiting to buy a playbook.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:05.620]   I'm not sure it's a huge number, but it definitely has a core group of people that are passionate
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.620]   about it.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:12.860]   I have to apologize because it's got an email and I made a mistake.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.860]   Because when I was running a program and I would launch another program, it looked like
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.300]   it froze the original program, and I was saying, "Well, that's not real multitasking.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.300]   It's pseudo-multitasking."
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.420]   Somebody sent me an email saying, "That's a setting in the settings.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:29.620]   If you are willing to kill your battery, you can have true multitasking where this will
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.940]   continue when the next program runs."
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:37.340]   But it's off by default because, of course, why would you want that?
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.340]   I don't know.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.340]   Yes.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.100]   It can do it.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.740]   Why would you want that?
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.660]   We could talk about some of the problems with RIM for another hour.
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:56.220]   I think one of the biggest issues I have with the playbook is that, first off, it shouldn't
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:57.220]   be called the playbook.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.220]   I think that...
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.900]   It's a business book, supposedly.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.380]   The workbook or something like that.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:04.660]   I mean, MQ saying this is the first enterprise class tablet.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.660]   Okay, fine.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.260]   Don't call it the playbook.
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:14.460]   I think there's actually something...I think there's actually an opportunity to market
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.900]   an enterprise class super secure tablet.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.260]   But I think that RIM just is trying to have it both ways.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.580]   I think that it's kind of mudding the waters.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.140]   It's kind of confusing people.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   I do like the form factor.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.780]   I like how well the QNX operating system responds.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.620]   It feels very fluid.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.940]   It's a nice interface.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.740]   It's very web OS-like.
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.740]   I actually...
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.140]   Peter, I think the name playbook, I think it's a double entendre.
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.460]   Playbook also implies strategy.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.580]   The idea that, "Hey, okay, you can do your plans on this.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.820]   You can build your playbook."
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.860]   I think that they're trying to imply that you can use it both for entertainment and for
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   work.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.020]   It's another one of those frustrating things like this.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:10.300]   I think that they shouldn't be emphasizing the entertainment, gaming elements.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.140]   I think that they should make a case for it specifically as an enterprise device.
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:16.660]   I think that they're not doing a good enough job of that.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.580]   It didn't mean to cut you off, Joy.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:24.460]   Well I think it reminds me a lot of the Zoom in that it's fairly unfinished.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.780]   There's no email at all.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.780]   It's frustrating.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:35.940]   All of these tablets, even the Honeycomb tablets, even after the 3.1 update on the Zoom, they
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.580]   all feel unfinished to me.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:42.220]   They all feel like there's something not there that I wish was there.
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.340]   And compared to the iPad.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:51.340]   Compared to the iPad, which is an Apple hit it out of the park with the first version.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.860]   These guys are still struggling trying to figure out who they want to be.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:59.020]   And they're not doing it for me yet, but all of them have potential.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.020]   I'm really interested in the WebOS tablet.
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:07.380]   I think if HP does it right and can market it half decently, which is a question with
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.660]   HP, I think it has a lot of potential.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:15.220]   But it could just be another tablet with potential.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:17.060]   Nvidia's CEO is very excited.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:26.220]   Most of these Zoom and this Galaxy tablet have the Tegra 2 chipset from Nvidia.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:33.740]   He says that the next generation tablets are going to be fix all these problems.
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:38.420]   He said Nvidia is working with Google and Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:45.700]   In fact, I didn't know this is a quad core Tegra called Kale.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:51.740]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:52.860]   I love this tablet.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.820]   I just, software is not really very mature.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.820]   It's little things like this.
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   And somebody told me it doesn't happen on theirs, but watch when I rotate.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.700]   Maybe it's because they have all these widgets.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.260]   It takes forever that has to rebuild this.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.660]   Yeah, that's a little too slow.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.920]   I mean, but you know, my, I don't have any Android tablets at the moment, but our honey
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.080]   cup tablets at the moment.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.940]   I did review a couple of them and the rotation was definitely not that slow for me.
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:20.940]   Okay.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:21.940]   So maybe I'm doing so.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.940]   I'm holding it wrong.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.140]   But, but the thing is it shouldn't be that slow even if you do those things.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:29.420]   So I think that's one of the, I mean, honeycomb was rushed.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.820]   I don't think anyone would dispute that.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.020]   I don't think Google would dispute that.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:38.420]   It came out too quickly because they felt the pressure from the iPad and you know, it's
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.500]   something that they're going to, they're going to fix and post so to speak.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.400]   But you've Kevin, you've seen this all before at all these C.S.s and Condexes.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.040]   This is clearly a category that is not a flash in the pan or is it?
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.240]   I don't think so.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:27:00.720]   I think this rim is probably trying to retain the loyalty of the blackberry of the blackberry
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.960]   crowd and stem defections.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.960]   Right.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.120]   And it's all these folks are looking like they're doing the ready fire aim.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   Right.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120]   Kind of strategy.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   That's exactly right.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.700]   They can't afford to let apples gap get any larger.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:19.260]   So they're trying to get something out the door, figuring we'll fix it as quick as we
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.060]   can so we don't fall further behind.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.460]   Let's see.
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:26.460]   What else?
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.660]   Are my missing something guys?
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.100]   Is there a big story?
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.780]   It feels kind of like a little bit of a slow week.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.700]   We led with the Apple stories.
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.700]   Huh?
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:44.020]   Not a lot of little stories but nothing really monstrously major I think jumps out.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:51.080]   The one about the story about Zuckerberg saying kids under 13 should be allowed on Facebook.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.880]   We want to make a Facebook for kids.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   That's just like...
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.360]   He's the new...
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.440]   He's taking the Eric Schmitt slime award for the weird...
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.800]   The creepiest CEO for the last six months.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.320]   There's already enough creepy stuff involving kids on Facebook now.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.360]   We know a huge number of other 13-year-olds do use Facebook.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360]   Right.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.720]   And then there was the woman who reported that her daughter when she signed up for Neopats
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.520]   many years ago gave a fake last name and now that her daughter's turned 18 she's receiving
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   credit card solicitations.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.520]   That's that name.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520]   With that fake name.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520]   That's interesting.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.720]   And she went to Neopats and said, "Are you selling the information of these children?"
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.760]   Once they become of age and they haven't really said anything.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.760]   Obviously.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.760]   Now that's interesting.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.000]   My daughter was a huge into Neopats.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.120]   I'll have to look and see what kind of mail she's getting.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.600]   She definitely used Neopats like crazy.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:56.880]   It's the federal government that prevents or restricts the kinds of information sites
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.840]   can gather about kids under 13.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.640]   So Facebook in order to do this would have to have some sort of special dispensation from
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.440]   parents or that kind of thing.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.080]   But you got to figure there's so many sub 13 year olds using Facebook.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.600]   It's just a, you know, that I can't really blame Mark for that.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.920]   He sees a big market.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.760]   Is it really creepy do I?
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.040]   Oh, I think so.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.440]   I mean, if you, you know, I think my kids are a lot older than that now.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:29.920]   But the idea of my kids say at nine, ten or eleven with free reign of a site like Facebook.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:36.480]   Now, you know, you could provide parental controls and, you know, give people the ability
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.440]   to kind of have control of what they kids do, but you can't control what other people
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.440]   do.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440]   Right.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440]   And that's kind of the problem.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:47.880]   It's by definition social and you have to, you have to worry about what other people
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.400]   are doing on it, not just what your kids are doing.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:55.160]   I love the, actually we'll take a break and come back, but I'm going to talk a little
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.160]   bit about actually this is a fairly big story.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   And I think Tim's IPO was this week.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.960]   And they, they thought that the IPO would go at about forty five dollars.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.960]   That was what they priced the shares at.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:14.680]   By the end of the day, they were twice that and a very interesting opinion piece in the
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:20.960]   New York Times by Jonah Sarah in which he, he says, the bankers scammed, link it in.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   And it happens all the time.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.840]   And I'm very curious what you guys think about this.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.040]   We'll talk about it in just a second before we do though.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.920]   I'd like to say hello to our friends at Siptrix, spakers of the great go to assist.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.400]   If you're in the support business, I know a lot of you is, a lot of you's got to get,
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.720]   get on the phone there and tell if it's not family and friends, colleagues, clients, or
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.240]   maybe you're actually an IT or software support person how to fix something and walk them
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.240]   through it on the phone.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.240]   You don't have to do that.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.240]   I would hope Kevin.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.440]   Oh, yes, we do.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:53.360]   And especially helping out mom, mom, mom's always fun.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.720]   That's where go to assist expresses.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.720]   So cool.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.120]   But for anybody where you want to just, if I could just let me at your computer, I could
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.120]   fix it.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.440]   A lot of times your clients or your support, support ease aren't nearby.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.000]   Maybe they're down the hall across town or even across the world with go to assist express
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.640]   you log in to their computer and fix it yourself.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.400]   Now I know there are many choices to do this, but there, this is the one that you want to
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   take a look at.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.040]   I'll tell you how to second for a couple of reasons.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:26.480]   First of all, it's Citrix, so you know it's 128 bit SSL 24/7 support for you and the fastest
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.480]   back end.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.640]   I mean, they really know remote access.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:35.320]   It's also very easy for your customers because all you have to do is send them a link.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.840]   They click it.
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.360]   They always have to download the go to assist software and that's to keep it always fresh,
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.120]   always up to date.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.800]   30 seconds later though, they're ready to go and you're fixing their system.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   There's chat.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   You can do eight sessions at once.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.120]   You can do unattended sessions if your clients allow you.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   It's nice.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.480]   You don't have to wait until they're there.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.400]   You can find out what operating system they're running, what software is running in the background.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.960]   There's so many nice features for anybody who's doing support remotely.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.040]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.640]   They have day passes too for those of us like you who have to fix mom's computer from time
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.120]   to time because I use this with my mom.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.120]   It's great.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.920]   That's the website.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.760]   Go to assist.com/twit and sign up for the 30 day free trial.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.360]   If you've got a bunch of people, you don't need to do it.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.720]   You wait until you've got a bunch of people who need support.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.160]   You queue them all up.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.200]   Then you trigger the free trial and you've got 30 days to fix it all.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.200]   The clock is ticking.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.960]   It's a new game show.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.480]   30 days to fix it.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.720]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.640]   We thank them for their support.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.080]   Thursday, LinkedIn.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.320]   First of all, is LinkedIn a good investment?
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.320]   Dwight?
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.120]   I don't know.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.680]   I'm so traumatized from pre-2000.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.960]   There's no question we're in a bubble.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.880]   The only difference is it's not a stock market bubble.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.480]   We're definitely in a bubble.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.000]   8.5 billion for Skype.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.160]   I'm too conservative.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.080]   I would not invest in LinkedIn.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.720]   And mainly because I probably would be holding out for Facebook.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.560]   Yeah, that's going to be the big one.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.240]   I just don't see LinkedIn being that compelling.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.080]   I think there's a lot of pin up demand for people wanting to invest in social media,
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.520]   which is why I think it was just a sexy stock at the moment, which is one of the reasons
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.160]   why it came in so hard.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.520]   What do you think?
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.160]   LinkedIn stock in your future?
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   Peter Rojas?
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.160]   You know what?
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.800]   I'm the world's worst stock picker.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800]   I'm worse.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800]   I'm worse.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:43.000]   I just let my guy just handle all that stuff.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.520]   Every time the few times that I've picked stocks, I've always lost money.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.560]   It's like horse races.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.240]   And I can't even second guess.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.560]   I can be like, "Well, my gun instinct says to buy, so maybe it should have said that
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.560]   I don't buy them."
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.360]   Maybe it's like, "No, I just stay away.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   Let the experts..."
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.360]   Let the pros, Analynn.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.320]   They don't even do that well.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.680]   Yeah, I'm doing all right.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:11.600]   I mean, I definitely made some bad decisions in 1.0.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.400]   I think you hit the nail on the head, Dwight.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.080]   I think that people can't buy Facebook, so they're casting around for, "Well, what's
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.760]   the most Facebook-like thing out there?
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.840]   I want to buy that."
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.120]   I think LinkedIn is a success.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.840]   I think it's heavily used by business.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.760]   It's become the social resume for people.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:38.360]   I think it's a big deal, but I don't think necessarily that it's not Facebook.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.600]   And I think that that's what people are waiting for.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.240]   I'm talking about stock picking.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.120]   I bought Apple when an IPO.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.080]   This was back before I covered tech.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.480]   And a few years later, I thought it was such a stinky stock.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.480]   I sold it so much.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.680]   And you were right a few years later.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.680]   It was.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.400]   Just after it came out.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.720]   But I wish I had held onto it now.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.280]   But that's exactly the point.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.280]   How the hell can you tell?
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   Right.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.520]   I think that the most famous father is a professional gambler and primarily horses.
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.760]   And he told me one time, "You're never going to beat me at this game."
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760]   So why bother?
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.600]   Because I'm at the track every day.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.600]   I know the horses.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.600]   I know the people.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.400]   And it's the same way with, I think, with a professional professional professional investors.
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.400]   Although you have investors.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.680]   If you look at professionally managed funds, they don't do that well now.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.880]   They often don't do as well as the market as a whole.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   So here's some numbers.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.000]   This is from Jonah Sarah's column.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.320]   First of all, 16 million in profit last year, 16 million in profit.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:37.000]   So it's not a hugely profitable company.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.640]   They hired Morgan Stanley in the bank and the Bank of America's Merrill Lynch division
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.040]   to manage the IPO.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.040]   That's what you do.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.280]   You get to hire the bankers.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.280]   They're the underwriters.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   They have to do that.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.040]   They decide, they gauge the market and decide on the price.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:55.880]   They decided that the LinkedIn IPO initial shares would be valued at $45.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.800]   At that point, they get a chunk of it to sell to their inside in-house investors.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.400]   They're big fish.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.720]   However you, unless you're one of those big fish, you aren't going to get it for $45.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:20.000]   Because when the stock market opened, it was already at $84 or $83 a share.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.160]   So LinkedIn only gets the $45 a share.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:26.400]   They sold 7.84 million shares, rate $352 million for the companies.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.880]   The company's happy.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.280]   Bankers get 7% of the deal as their fee.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.720]   The opening price, not $45.83.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:41.320]   By the time the clock struck noon, the stock was $120 a share that settled down to $94.25
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.680]   at the market close.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.600]   That's 110% gain on the first day.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:51.320]   But here's Joe's point.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.840]   He said, "Suppose your trusted real estate agent persuaded you to sell your house for
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.200]   a million dollars."
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.960]   Which is basically what these bankers did.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.280]   They said, "45 bucks."
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.560]   The next day, they turn around and sold the same house to a new owner for $2 million.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:13.120]   Basically, this is what Henry Blodgett says, "Meryl and Morgan did to LinkedIn."
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.360]   They convinced LinkedIn to sell all their stock at $45.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:24.360]   And they were getting $84 when the market opened and 94 by the time the market closed.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.680]   He says, "This bad behavior."
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.080]   LinkedIn, of course, gets enough money that they probably don't complain.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.880]   But I have to say that is slimy.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.440]   Didn't Google, when they went public, try to do something to get around them?
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.000]   They did a Dutch auction.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.120]   Bill Hambrecht thought that up.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.640]   That was very clever.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.640]   It did avoid that.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:47.160]   Yeah, I'm surprised that LinkedIn didn't do something similar.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   They were by the same token.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.320]   I don't think they necessarily expected it or even the bankers expected it to pop as
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.840]   much as it did.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.680]   And they did raise the price.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.240]   I do believe they raised the price.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.240]   They did.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   I mean, it was lower.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   It was $45.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240]   Yeah, they raised it a couple of times.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.680]   I mean, I don't know how well can you gauge what it's going to go to?
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680]   You can't.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.480]   So it's kind of an educated guess.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:17.000]   If they had priced it at $83, would it have hit at $100 or $120?
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   Right.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.520]   You know, is it guaranteed to pop higher than what you do just because there hasn't been
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.080]   a tech IPO like this in a long time?
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   Right.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:36.480]   So LinkedIn, this company that made $16 million last year has a $7.9 billion market cap.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.960]   And are we in a bubble?
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.560]   I think we are.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.480]   I think we are.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.160]   The like button, as long as we're talking creepy.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.560]   Now this is Wall Street Journal.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.560]   And I know Wall Street Journal has kind of got a hair trigger on privacy.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:39:02.400]   But they say that the like button and Twitter's tweet button allows sites to basically follow
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.200]   you around the web.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   Facebook's buttons appear.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.320]   And I just put a, I'm curious about this because I just put a like button on my blog.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.680]   Those buttons appear in about a third of the words thousand, the world's thousand most
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680]   fitted websites.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.840]   I'm sure gadget uses a like button, right?
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.560]   We'll be bringing back in the Facebook stuff.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.560]   You'd be crazy not to.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.120]   It drives a ton of traffic.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:30.800]   You know, I mean, is this surprising anyone that, you know, if a website, anytime a website
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.400]   has any sort of JavaScript, you know, embedded on another site, they're basically tracking
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.840]   you because they can see what's, you know, being called and with Facebook.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.080]   Facebook is tracking you because they basically have an asset on all those pages.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:50.800]   So if you've logged into Facebook anytime in the last month and you continue to browse,
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.600]   even if you don't press the like button, Facebook knows what pages you visited because it's
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:01.160]   getting its little servlet saying, Oh, Leo just visited GDGT.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.720]   And so Facebook is essentially tracking you with a like button as long as you remain logged
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.720]   in.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.200]   If you log out of Facebook, you're okay.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.040]   Right. And logging out is your is your solution.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.440]   I think that's your relief is you, if you don't want them tracking you, then when you're
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.920]   done with your session at Facebook, log out, which a lot of people don't do.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.040]   Nobody does because I do because it's convenient.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.040]   You do that, Kevin?
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.560]   Yeah. Clear. Clear the cookies. Run no script.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.560]   Wow.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.720]   I logged down forever a year ago.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.560]   If so, yeah, you're smart.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.040]   And I wish I could do that.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.040]   You know what?
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.560]   I have never regretted doing that.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.120]   No, no, no regrets.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.720]   In fact, every time I go to Facebook and I do every day, I think this I there's nothing
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720]   here for me.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.920]   Yeah, I'm seeing these updates from my friends, but I'm bored.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.120]   There's not it's not very compelling.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.800]   I think maybe I should start playing farmville.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.800]   I don't know.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:54.880]   Yeah, I don't like Facebook, but I'm there because they want to spy on my kids and it's
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.720]   also part of my job, you know, but I would think if I, you know, if I didn't, if my kids
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.440]   weren't on it and and I didn't have to do it for work, I probably would not be there.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:09.840]   Facebook says, as does Twitter, as does Google, we don't, we don't use that browsing data.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.720]   Well, if you're not paying for it, you're, you're not the customer.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.240]   You're the product being sold.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.160]   Well, we're the product being sold.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.000]   And you're browsing and the like buttons.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.400]   We're not Facebook customers.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.200]   We are it's asset.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.200]   Correct.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.800]   Well, that's true though of people listening to show.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.680]   I'm going to be too quick to target them with that brush.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.760]   Well, you're you're not paying for Twitch.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.920]   You're an asset, but you're not selling your, I'm not selling demographic data.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.560]   No, I am not.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.560]   I am not.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.760]   I don't have it.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760]   Right.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.240]   But Facebook does correct.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240]   It has proved useful.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:42:00.040]   I'm helping to put together a reunion coming up in a couple of weeks and it was great for
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.040]   that.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.520]   It's a place to chase people down, but it was interesting once we had everybody, everything
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.960]   shifted into an email list and circulated.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.240]   It's a none of the stuff that's been going back and forth with updates on people has
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.960]   been flowing through Facebook.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.480]   I find it really hard to believe that Facebook's not using this stuff.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480]   So think about it.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.200]   I mean, Facebook, you voluntarily, you create a Facebook page, you voluntarily give it a
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.800]   huge amount of information about you, not just your age, but I mean, just a ton, your
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   social graph, all sorts of information about you.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.200]   Now they know that and every time you visit a page with a like button, they know you visited
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.200]   that page.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.760]   It seems like they're aggregating a huge amount of valuable data.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.360]   Why would they not use that?
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.560]   Well, the data you put in might not be true.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.720]   Oh, so that's your advice lie.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:50.160]   Well, it depends.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.960]   It's your choice.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:58.360]   But I know a lot of companies, a lot of companies collect a lot, a lot of data and then don't
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360]   do anything.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:04.680]   The mechanism to use it or it may cost them more to use it than to then that leave it
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.080]   alone for now.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.640]   But certainly in the future, Facebook could always come back and take that data and it
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.480]   would be at that point, historical data as well as current and it would be even more
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480]   valuable.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.240]   So the fact that they're not doing it out doesn't mean they won't do it in the future,
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.240]   right?
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.240]   Ken from Chicago tells me that it's a violation of Facebook's terms of service to lie.
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.200]   Do not lie to them.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.200]   Do not lie to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.840]   Do not lie to them.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.320]   Twitter says we don't keep those.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.920]   Our cookies expire very quickly.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.760]   I don't know about that.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:42.560]   Big explosion at Foxconn, the Foxconn plant.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.920]   This is where everything is made.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   Hute.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.480]   I mean, everything is made, including all the Apple stuff.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:44:02.800]   Let's see, I'm just looking at this story a couple of days ago.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:08.080]   The explosion was due to a special dust, which is used to clean the screens of the iPad.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.120]   It's a flammable dust and someone was smoking.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.920]   The explosion occurred in a polishing plant.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.760]   Oh, the humanity.
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.960]   All those iPads lost.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.960]   That's the production line of the iPad 2.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.920]   Unclear what the impact will be on Apple, but there's already shortages of iPad 2, so
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920]   get ready.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.960]   There might be more.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.600]   There were people online picking up the chips yesterday morning from Europe and they were
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.120]   buying 18 team Verizon ones just to have one.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.120]   Just to get them.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.320]   They knew they wouldn't be able to use that part of it.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.560]   Desperate to get them.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.960]   They were definitely making sure that these people knew they were buying something they
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.760]   couldn't use and they really didn't care.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:02.480]   By the way, those of you who feel that Sony's troubles are over, people were killed.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.320]   I'm sorry, in the Foxconn plant, three people died so far, so I apologize for implying that
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.520]   all we lost was iPads.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.960]   Obviously it's a tragic accident.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:17.360]   Sony, speaking of tragedy and accidents.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.800]   Apparently somebody put a fishing site on one of Sony's servers out of Thailand.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.400]   This is nothing to do with the PSN hack.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.800]   They've just been hacked again.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.600]   They should put somebody new in charge of their security.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.080]   The kicker one.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.440]   Howard Stringer said that they called the original hack and the problem with the network
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.920]   being down for a month a hiccup.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.320]   No network is secure.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.240]   There's still a backup in Japan.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.840]   Japan hasn't certified PSN to come back out.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840]   That's right.
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.200]   They were in the Japan took it very seriously.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.200]   Let's see.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:45:59.200]   I guess that's...
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.680]   I can't think of anything else.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.360]   chat room, you got anything else we should talk about?
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.360]   I should just wrap it up.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.480]   I want to thank Kevin Barrett for joining us.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.320]   He's at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.880]   He came here for the sunshine.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:11.880]   We've had sun recently.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:12.880]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:13.880]   The rain has stopped.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.880]   Thank goodness.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:18.320]   Although there were ducks swimming in the drainage ditch in front of my house when I
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.320]   left.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.000]   Kevin sent me an email and I want to be on Twitter.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.720]   I said, "Come on down."
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.000]   It's a great having you.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000]   We appreciate it.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:34.640]   Also here the great Peter Rojas, Immortal Legend of Gadget fame gggt.com.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.800]   We just relaunched.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.160]   So people got to check it out.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.360]   That's the best place to ask and answer questions about gadgets on the way.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.560]   So you're now like the Quora for gadgets?
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:50.760]   Well, I think Quora is a gadget for Silicon Valley stuff.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.760]   Much more appropriate.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.840]   Yeah, that's how we talk about it.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.480]   Gee, that's what we say.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   Yeah, I know.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.320]   I know it's because I've been getting questions.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.920]   Oops, let me put the screen up.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:04.600]   I've been getting questions in my email.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.520]   Ryan Block wants to know.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.960]   How come the HDMI doesn't, Netflix doesn't support HDMI on the iPad 2, things like that?
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.960]   This is cool.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:18.800]   Yeah, we created something that we think makes it kind of fun to ask and answer questions
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.800]   about this stuff.
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.120]   We did some really interesting stuff on the UI that no one is really doing.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.880]   It's kind of hard to explain without being able to show it.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.360]   Well, should I show?
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.760]   Yeah, if you log in, you'll see.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.760]   Let me log in.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.320]   Yeah, I don't know why I wasn't logged in.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   That's just this machine.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.760]   I use it all the time.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.760]   Of course.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.760]   Yeah, of course I do.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:40.240]   Let me connect with Facebook because I think they don't know enough about me.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.720]   You know, I should definitely not be working right now.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:44.720]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.080]   Then welcome back, Leo, but I need to...
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.080]   It does work.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080]   Congratulations.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.080]   Okay, good.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.240]   I just need to get my...
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.240]   Remember my password.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:55.080]   Don't you hate that?
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.120]   I don't know why LastPass isn't running on this machine.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.720]   I never enter passwords anymore.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.720]   Oh, good.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.920]   Look, I like this.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.160]   Success equals true.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.560]   I think that that means it's not working.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.560]   Okay.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.960]   I don't know why it says that.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.160]   So let me back out and go back to the front page.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:23.840]   There I haven't been on since the redesign, but I come in here and I've got all these
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:29.120]   people who are on Twitter who I follow and they all are saying, "Some really smart people
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.120]   use gadget.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.440]   Here a few of you may want to follow.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:32.800]   These are all people I follow on Twitter.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800]   Are you tracking me, Peter?"
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.720]   Hey, what's going on there?
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.720]   What's going on?
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.200]   The funny thing is we just created a suggested users list and there's probably just a lot
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200]   of overlap there.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.200]   Hey, this is great.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.200]   This is really nice.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.960]   It's very different.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.440]   Is this kind of a pivot though?
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:57.000]   In the past, what I would do is I'd list all the gadgets that I owned or wanted.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.200]   That was the focus of it.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:04.000]   When you added news, so these are all the gadgets I own on my gadget page.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.160]   So Q&A was always a big part of the site and it was actually when we looked at the user
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.720]   data, the thing that people were using the most.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:19.640]   Then what we did was we pulled away stuff like that people weren't really using as much
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:23.720]   and decided to focus on the Q&A part of the site.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.160]   If you go to the homepage, it should come up.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.040]   I'm clicking on the homepage.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.040]   Here's the video.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.960]   First is a video of Veronica, which you can watch.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.960]   Probably skip that.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:35.960]   No, I like Veronica.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:36.960]   It takes a couple minutes.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:37.960]   Okay.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:38.960]   All right, I'll skip that.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.960]   Let's go.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.960]   Okay, I'll press the let's go.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:41.960]   Stay there, Veronica.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.960]   Don't leave.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:43.960]   Here's the people you suggested to follow.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:45.960]   How can I not be following Peter?
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.960]   I don't know.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960]   That's weird.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.360]   Kevin Rose, oh, I just never got around to it.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.720]   The reason is because I just never thought about it.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.280]   So now I'm following all those good people.
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   Let me move on.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   We're just going to give you stuff to do.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:05.000]   We keep loading up new stuff to check out.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000]   This is great.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.240]   It keeps coming at you.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.160]   Just coming and coming at you.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.080]   There's one question.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.800]   By the way, is a gadget rip of 42?
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.280]   Is that good or bad?
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:20.920]   That's low, but you can raise it.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:21.920]   So here's that question.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.920]   Why does HBO go?
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.280]   Not Netflix play.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.640]   Why doesn't it play via HDMI in the iPad 2?
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.680]   Let me go to that question because I'm curious.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.680]   What is the answer?
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:32.280]   So this is a little quora-like.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.080]   I mean, a little bit.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:40.240]   We're just trying to do something that's kind of optimized for gadgets.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:42.280]   So build it when you build your list of gadgets.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.760]   That's how we will send you questions.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.760]   So you'll see questions from your friends, but also from the gadgets.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.760]   That's good.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.960]   Yeah, so that's probably why I got this.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:49.960]   Now, I love it.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.360]   You can vote up questions.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.160]   Mark is a good answer.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.080]   And so the top questions will be the ones that have the best answers, right?
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.320]   Presumably.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.320]   This is great.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.320]   Very nice.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.320]   So I don't have to play with this.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.520]   Yeah, people are digging it.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:11.440]   Ryan and I spent a long time working on this design and trying to take away a lot of the
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:16.280]   pain points and then trying to create something that people would find more engaging and
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.280]   more fun.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.920]   And at heart, we're just super gadget nerds.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:23.520]   And we just wanted something that as gadget nerds, we could go and just spend a lot of
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.520]   time with.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.200]   I do like this.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.800]   I never quite understood the idea behind quora and form spring, but this is a little
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.560]   more directed, which I think that's kind of makes sense.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:36.720]   Yeah, it's just focused on gadgets.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:40.440]   And if you have gadget questions, it's a good place to ask them.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:43.920]   And if you have-- the thing is, it's almost like more fun to answer questions than to
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:44.920]   ask them.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.920]   Right.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.720]   And that would be the key because you got to get people to answer them.
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.720]   That's where the contact comes from.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.240]   Though I have to tell you, we need more people asking questions too.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.760]   We just rolled this out a few days ago.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.360]   We actually haven't even publicly announced it yet.
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   Oh.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360]   I think this is as public as we've been.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.360]   How exciting.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.360]   It's not quite.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.360]   Well, congratulations.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.360]   Thanks.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.360]   So that's gdgt.com.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.400]   If you don't have an account, you should make one.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:11.640]   And then you should follow Leo Laport because he's a very nice guy and he needs a-- oh, my
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.840]   reputation's up to two points.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:15.840]   Thank you.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:16.840]   Thank you.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:19.320]   You don't want to see Ryan's rap score.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.320]   Is it real high?
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.080]   Yeah, it's like-- it's pretty high.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.080]   Thousands?
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.080]   It's the rap score.
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.080]   Yeah, well, it's-- you know, he's Ryan.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:28.080]   Oh, well.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.600]   Yeah, it's pretty-- it's pretty-- I think actually he can just give himself whatever
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:32.600]   score he was.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.920]   Yeah, that's why it's so high.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:34.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.400]   He's got-- let's see.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.160]   Oh, 6,196 reputation points.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.160]   Yeah.

[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920]   Thank you for being here.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920]   Peter, great to see you again.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]   Thanks for having me back on.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.880]   Mr. Dwight Silverman does so many things.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.520]   Of course, his day job is at the Houston Chronicle where he runs the 10 vlogs.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.520]   We just launched a new-- we just relaunched our blog network.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520]   You too?
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.520]   In fact, the URL has changed.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.680]   Oh, what is it now?
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.600]   It's blog singular dot cron dot com.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:14.400]   We went-- we were using a 2005 installation of moveable type.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.400]   Wow.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:19.280]   We are now using WordPress 3.something.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.360]   And we'll be going to 3.1 soon.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.440]   But we are now on a modern platform.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.200]   We've done a redesign.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:29.480]   And I'm kind of-- it's changed my life.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.880]   Time to blog.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:31.880]   And you've been--
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.880]   You've been-- you've been-- you've been--
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:33.880]   you've been-- you've been--
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:34.880]   you've been-- you've been--
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:35.880]   I think it looks like.
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.720]   And I kind of have been the point person on the redesign and launch--
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.720]   Who I like this.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.400]   --the editorial point for you.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.800]   And it's been just a blast.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.440]   And our staff loves it.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:52.040]   Usually, when you make a technology change, journalists don't like it.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.280]   They love this.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:55.480]   Eric Sight.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:54:01.480]   Dwight also hosts his own radio show on Pacifica Radio in Houston.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.000]   Yep, Wednesday nights.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.680]   kpt.org.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:08.640]   It's technology bites with four other geeks.
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.440]   And it's a really good time.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.720]   We've had Leo on a few times.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:12.880]   You need to come back, Leo.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.920]   Any time I love doing it.
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.840]   It's a really fun show.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.240]   Really enjoy it.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:20.280]   We also invite you to buy a brick.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.520]   ricks.twit.tv.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:22.400]   Our bricks are on sale.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.640]   We've sold over 400 of them.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:24.320]   That's very exciting.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:27.720]   We're going to have some-- if you go to the bricks.twit.tv,
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.600]   you'll see the different bricks you can buy.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.800]   We have a four by eight brick, which is, I think, $128.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:37.800]   You can get the eight by eight brick.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.600]   Let's press the button.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.600]   What happened here?
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.720]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:48.160]   Eight by eight bricks, which are-- oh, I see that.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.160]   Which are $512.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:53.520]   And if you want to logo $640, and we will put them on the wall
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.520]   of honor in the entry lobby of the new Twit Studios.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:58.080]   So a lot.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:58.840]   A lot of people buy them.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:54:59.880]   It's really cool.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.440]   And it helps us pay for the incredibly high cost
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.960]   of a brand new studio.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.840]   So I thought, I saw that ballparks do this.
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:09.600]   I thought, well, this would be kind of fun.
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:15.400]   bricks.twit.tv, or you'll find it at the front page of twit.tv.

[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:17.760]   Thank you.

[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.520]   We do the show every Sunday, 6 p.m.,
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.040]   Eastern, 3 p.m., Pacific, at live.twit.tv.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:30.880]   Meanwhile, what do I say at the end of the show?
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.240]   Oh, another Twit.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.200]   It's in the can.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.200]   See you.
