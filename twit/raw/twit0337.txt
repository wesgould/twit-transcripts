[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.040]   It's so funny because we thought because there's
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.400]   this football game on that we would not--
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   and we asked John C. and he says, no,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.720]   I'm watching the football game.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   And I thought, oh, we'll never get a panel together.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.080]   We better go to Brazil or Britain or somewhere
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.560]   where they don't like this stuff.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.360]   And look what we got.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200]   We got one of the best panels ever starting to my left.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.240]   Ed bot, we haven't had on for ages.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.200]   It's great to see you again, Ed.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.680]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.400]   Ed blogs for ZDNet.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.360]   What's the-- well, it's right there, edbot.com.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.240]   That's the question.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah, there's a link to the ZDNet blog on that page.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.040]   And especially covering windows.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.680]   But I have to say you have been really forthright now
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.960]   spoken lately about a lot of interesting stuff,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600]   not just windows related, including
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.800]   and we're going to get to it in just a little bit Apple's
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.080]   educational announcements.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.120]   Also here with us from, let's say from Google+,
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   kind of is by Calvin.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.640]   That's where I was before I came in.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.080]   Like, Calvin who lives on Google+ if you go to elegant.com/elgam,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.520]   that's where you'll go.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.680]   He, of course, uses Google+ to generate his newsletter,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   his weekly newsletter, which is a must read.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.520]   It has been for a long time.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.800]   Also, catch him on computer world and other sites.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.760]   So it's great to have you.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.480]   Thanks for bringing vegan raw organic chocolate.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's a drug.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   Well, you can smell it.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   It's not a controlled substance.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.560]   Eileen Rivera, it's a drug, isn't it?
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.880]   Yes, it can confirm it is a drug.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.280]   And she is an addict.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.120]   I am.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.960]   Legal in California.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.040]   It is so good.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   Holy moly, dark is midnight.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.560]   It's raw.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.680]   Fearless is the name.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.320]   Thank you.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.360]   Is this part of you and your wife do this diet?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.200]   Yes, we do.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.040]   Is this part of it?
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.360]   It's pretty close.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   The chocolate is raw.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.200]   It's pure cocoa.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.240]   There's no junk in it.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.480]   It has rapidura in it.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   But yeah, this is--
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.120]   That's what?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.960]   Rapidura.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.320]   It's a good--
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.800]   It's a good--
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.880]   It's a fairly innocuous form of sugar.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.520]   So--
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.960]   Oh, more meat and more of them.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.360]   That's all it has, chocolate and rapidura.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.800]   Rapidura.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.200]   Good stuff.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   And it's made of 100% post-consumer recycled paper.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.800]   That's right.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600]   That's great.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.160]   Patrick Norton is also here from techzilla.com.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.080]   Great to see you, Patrick.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   A pleasure to be here.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   Bombarded, barged into your broadcast
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   at CES.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.680]   It was awesome.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.560]   I actually had a bet.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.280]   I said, OK, $10.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   If I peek my head around the corner
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.400]   while Patrick is broadcasting, he will break the broadcast
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   and say, Leo, and I won.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.640]   Well, that's the way it works.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.280]   It also wasn't like, you know, you popped up and disappeared.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040]   You popped up and there was a hang time.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.360]   Well, I was thinking I wanted to win the money.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.920]   Great to see you once again.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   Thank you, sir.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   He's wearing his college shirt.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.240]   I love it.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.440]   Joe College.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.360]   Is that-- I think that didn't--
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.860]   Yes.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.920]   John Belushi, you believe it?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.760]   In the-- in the--
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.660]   In the house.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.240]   Before it became Senator Blue Tarski.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   Love it.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   College, generic.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.440]   Hey, who's that?
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.080]   Callie Lewis is here also from geekbeat.tv and revision 3.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.720]   Great to see you.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.840]   You too.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.440]   I want to know more about this diet
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   where I can eat chocolate all the time.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   Well, we'll have to ask Mike.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.240]   Look at him.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.800]   He looks fit.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.600]   He looks trim.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.760]   I tell you, but I have to pay Apple 30%.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.240]   All right.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.740]   All right.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.240]   All right.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.560]   I'm going to write to it because I know you and Ed bot
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.240]   have opposing viewpoints.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   And I'd love to talk about this.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.640]   So there was a lot this week we're
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.280]   going to talk about.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.640]   SOPA, PIPA, the blackout on Wednesday.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.480]   29 members of Congress recanting because of it.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.240]   Recanting.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.360]   And then the very next day, magalplode.com/plode.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.800]   That's what I call magalplode.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.640]   Magal upload explodes with a big bust.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.600]   We have Apple's announcements that same day.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.560]   There's a ton to talk about.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.840]   Let's start with the Apple announcement.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   So they did it early in the morning, 7 AM our time.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.920]   So for those of you who tuned in
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.520]   to see the live broadcast, I was sleeping.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   Sorry.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.800]   Not getting up for that.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.920]   But a lot of live bloggers-- and I
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.960]   was watching the live blog in my jammies--
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.240]   and they made three big announcements.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   Not unexpected, but three big education announcements.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.320]   Number one, they announced iBooks 2,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.920]   which in the iBooks store now features a big textbook section.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   They have a few free textbooks.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.120]   The E.O. Wilson book on biodiversity is a couple of chapters,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.960]   but it's beautiful.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.000]   It's got video, interactive graphics.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.880]   There's an algebraic textbook, a number of textbooks,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.200]   all of which are $14.99 or less.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.920]   They got the three big guys involved.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.800]   We'll see how much of their content they put on here,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.480]   but they bought Pearson, McGraw-Hill-Hark,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.560]   and Harcourt-Brace-Jevova-Vitch, or whatever
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.680]   they're called these days.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.720]   They keep adding names.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   I don't know.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.000]   I'll say they're players.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   That's like 90% of the textbook market.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.080]   So that was the first announcement.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.680]   Second announcement was a tool to create these books.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   An iBook author tool that's free in the AMAC App Store.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.200]   The iBooks, of course, free on the iPad and iPhone.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.640]   And finally-- and I think this probably, to me,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   maybe the most important announcement,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.760]   but kind of got buried-- a new iTunes U that
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.920]   features additional tools for teachers to share.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.800]   There's syllabuses and exams and notes.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   And K through 12, as well as university.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.680]   I think, frankly, if you talk about a world changer,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.560]   it's this.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.480]   I mean, this iTunes U has always been
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   like the best kept secret of iTunes.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.720]   You can get a college education.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.320]   You don't get credit, but you don't have to pay any money for it.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.360]   And it's amazing.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.320]   And now it's a sharing notes part I've never really
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.880]   taken a lot from, because I've borrowed people's notes
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.000]   from college and boy, people take some really strange notes
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.520]   in the middle of lectures.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.200]   Hey, you don't have to go to a lecture.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.360]   You can do it all at home.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.800]   Maybe it's important here in the US.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.520]   There are lots of people who are smart who
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560]   can't afford a higher education.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.440]   But I think worldwide, even more important
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.320]   in emerging nations, this is huge.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   It's huge.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.200]   And many of the things that they added to it,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.800]   I think, will increase adoption by university.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.840]   If you go to iTunes U, there's a lot of content there,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.200]   but it's not a lot, a lot of content.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   It's not like it's constantly being refreshed.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.400]   Many of the lectures on specific subjects
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.840]   have been there for two years.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.920]   They haven't been new ones.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.680]   I think with additional adoption through these other tools,
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   we're going to see a lot more schools embracing it.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   It's also now for high schools.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.560]   So K through 12.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.000]   K through 12, exactly.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.080]   And so I think that that part of it
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.920]   is really pretty exciting for education.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   I agree.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.160]   Now--
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.240]   I love that they've done all this.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.360]   I think textbooks, fantastic, and everything.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.160]   But can I rant for a second about the name iTunes 2?
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.640]   I mean, I books too.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   I books too.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.480]   Like seriously.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.320]   What did you want?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.520]   I come up with a better name.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.240]   Well, it's the second one.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.520]   The truth is, for most people, it won't look like it's
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.680]   a new app at all.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.880]   It's just an update to the old app
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.240]   and it gives them this additional textbook section.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.920]   That's all.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.960]   It is a great thing.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.160]   I just hate the name.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.040]   Well, we'll come up with a better name.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.600]   Let's see.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.960]   iTunes-- what does it even need a new name?
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.840]   iTunes, me.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.280]   Yeah, that'll sell.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.400]   You know what iTunes U.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.160]   iTunes U and iTunes Me.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.040]   iBooks 2.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.200]   They could ask Microsoft to suggest to me.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.720]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.920]   BPOS.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.000]   There you go.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That'd be awesome.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.560]   So Ed Bot, though, you and a lot of other people
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.360]   called attention to the fact that this iBook author tool,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.800]   despite the fact that it's free,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   has an owner-- what you consider being owner is Yula.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.440]   That's part of it.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.720]   And the other part of it is in a brand new post
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   that I just published at ZeeDeeNet about seven minutes ago.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.600]   Oh, you sneaky boy.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.120]   Well, it's Sunday afternoon.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.200]   You had to publish it before the football game.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.760]   Because Edivers off, so you could slip it in there.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.160]   But yeah, there's a couple issues there.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.280]   Number one, this is the first consumer software end-user
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.560]   license agreement that I've ever seen
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.040]   that restricts the right of the customer
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.960]   to do whatever they want with the output of the program.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.080]   Not true.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.560]   Microsoft Office, does that?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.920]   No.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.640]   Word doesn't say you can't write.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.200]   Yes, it does.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.400]   The Microsoft Office home and student version
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.880]   says you cannot use anything made with the software
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.480]   for commercial purposes or even nonprofit uses.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.360]   Well, Mike, no, actually, if you read it,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.760]   it says you can't use the software for that.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.440]   It doesn't talk about the output of it.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.640]   And I'd be perfectly happy if Apple
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   wanted to say in their license agreement,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.320]   this software may only be used for non-commercial purposes.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.040]   That's fine.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.840]   But even if you use it to create a PDF file,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.960]   you can't sell that PDF file.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.560]   It does.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.160]   It has a number of different outputs,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.360]   including the modified EPUB3 format
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.560]   that Apple's proposing, which is an extension of EPUB3,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.600]   but also PDF, HTML5, and some others.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.240]   So you're saying if I make a PDF with this tool,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.160]   which anybody could see now, it doesn't--
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.680]   and by the way, it loses a lot of the multimedia features,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   right, I presume?
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.600]   All of them, pretty much all of them.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.040]   But I still can't sell it.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   Right.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.680]   I mean, I don't like it, but isn't it their right to say that?
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.160]   I mean, it's a free tool.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.800]   There will be open source choices for EPUB3, won't there?
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.400]   Well, what's interesting is, as I explained
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   in the new post that I just put up today,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Apple has built--
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.120]   Which is titled How Apple is Sabotaging
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.880]   in Open Standard for Digital Books.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.160]   Right.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.840]   Apple has built the EPUB3 platform on the Open EPUB standard.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.920]   You can go back through its public statements on EPUB3,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.600]   and over and over and over again,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.440]   they talk about their support for the open industry
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.600]   leading EPUB3 standard.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   With the EPUB3 program, what they've done
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   is they have added non-standard attributes
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.960]   to what is essentially the underlying EPUB standard.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.720]   You can't import an EPUB document into it.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.040]   You can't export an EPUB document from it.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.320]   And so what they're basically doing
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.080]   is the same exact thing.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.280]   It's embrace, extend, extinguish.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.640]   Just like Microsoft tried to do in the 1990s
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   with Internet Explorer to Netscape,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.360]   this is what Apple is trying to do
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.320]   by leveraging their dominant position in the tablet marketplace
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.000]   with the iPad, and then creating
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.160]   a proprietary incompatible version
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.400]   of an open industry standard.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.560]   And I don't like that.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.760]   Well, I get you with the whole undermining open standards.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.920]   But exactly what percentage of books
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.360]   are actually consumed on, say, the iBook
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.560]   compared to the Kindle and the UMPTE and other reader
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.240]   platforms out there?
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   I would guess that the percentage is roughly equal
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.880]   to the percentage that Internet Explorer had in 1995
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.600]   when Windows 95 came out.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.160]   And it's probably in the 1, 2, 3% range.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.920]   And I always get to be much higher in the future.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.520]   You can almost guarantee that that's the case.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.680]   That's why I'm doing it.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.320]   Right.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.280]   So you start now, you give it away,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.120]   you build market share, and then you dominate.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.160]   You can effectively--
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.320]   No, I'm talking about the entire--
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   You dump.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.440]   But what he's saying, just like Internet Explorer
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.880]   was dumped in order to put Mozilla out of business--
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.640]   Netscape, I should say, out of business--
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.800]   we give it away free, and then we gain market share,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.680]   and then we clobber them.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.800]   So you're saying it's that kind of predatory practice.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.760]   You know what I have to say--
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.600]   Absolutely.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.280]   Completely what I expect from Apple.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.080]   Here, exactly.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.560]   There are 17 ebook file formats, according to Wikipedia.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.840]   But EPUB3 is the one that we're all
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.960]   going to be excited about, right?
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   Yeah, EPUB3 and the point that they took an open standard
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   and made it not open-- that's what Kindle did as well.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.400]   True.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.440]   They used the Moby standard, which is not proprietary.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.480]   But all of this whole license agreement thing, to me,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.160]   my belief is that they're trying to change cultural behavior,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.600]   essentially, is what they're trying to do.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.800]   In exactly the same way that when they came out with the iPhone
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.560]   and had a keyboard everybody complained about on screen,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.080]   which nobody wanted to use, they didn't let anybody make
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.920]   a hardware keyboard.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.640]   They didn't make one.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.960]   They didn't let anybody else make one.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   Why?
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.200]   Because they wanted to train the world, which they did for two
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.880]   years at least, to get used to this--
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.720]   and they actually brought on-screen keyboards
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.400]   and made it-- made the world safe for on-screen keyboards.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   They did that successfully.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.120]   They do that a lot.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.280]   Google does it, too.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.800]   Changing behavior is the business model.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.560]   Doesn't mean it's OK.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.720]   That's the Starbucks business model, too, to change--
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.280]   Sure.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.240]   But I'm saying that this is why they're doing it.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.520]   The reason they have these restrictions is they don't want
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.560]   you to use the iBooks authoring tool to do a lowest comment
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.080]   denominator thing that works just as well with a PDF.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.800]   No, they want to--
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.360]   They want a proprietary format.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.600]   They want to get a bunch of people.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.200]   They're used to the idea of creating
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.840]   the multimedia thing with video and stuff.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.760]   And yes, it's because they want to sell iBooks.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.240]   It's because they want to control the market.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.000]   They don't want to just control the educational market.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.240]   They want to control--
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   Digital publishers.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.040]   No question about that.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.240]   This strategy only works if the market buys into it.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.760]   But what is the likelihood that Apple will succeed here?
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.680]   I mean, won't people say, well, screw that?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.560]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.400]   I want to see something--
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.600]   The only thing that's happening in the middle is right.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.320]   They'll succeed exactly how they succeed in other markets.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.960]   They'll have the high-end, expensive, educated minority
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.320]   of--
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.480]   The BMWs, yeah.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Callie, nobody you'll notice, so it'll just happen?
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.200]   Well, that's why a lot of things happen, right?
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.480]   Right.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.360]   It just sneaks in.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.680]   You're absolutely right about Apple
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.280]   trying to change behaviors.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.520]   We see it over and over and over again.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.320]   I just got a new MacBook Air, and I'm
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.920]   dealing with line for the first time, actually.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.080]   And I mean, they're always doing that.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:29.400]   And I don't know that we're seeing anything different than Amazon
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.040]   doing the same thing, locking everything down.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   So I mean, we're seeing it also in apps, on TVs.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.040]   Everyone's locking into their own ecosystem.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.160]   And as soon as the world we just live in.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   But as we know, that's bad for consumers.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   It's good for business, bad for consumers.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   So Ed, what do we do about this?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.200]   Yeah, where's the compromise?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.120]   How do we solve that?
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.800]   I mean, people do do do do do do.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.120]   I hope the Department of Justice is paying attention to this stuff.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.520]   They used to.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   Yeah, we know.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   You know, the Department of Justice
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.680]   is supposed to pay attention to competing standards
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.960]   by competing companies that enable more competition
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.360]   in a marketplace?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.240]   No, the Department of Justice is supposed to pay attention
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.920]   to a company that has a dominant position in a marketplace
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.440]   such as tablets.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.760]   Right.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.120]   And when they leverage that dominant position
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.720]   in to gain market share in another area by giving things away.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.080]   I mean, the analogies to internet explorer and windows
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.400]   in the 1996 to 1998 period are just--
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.720]   Yeah, I mean, they're just staggering to me.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   But look what happened with that prosecution.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.320]   I mean, the Department of Justice went after him.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.080]   It took 10 years by the time--
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.040]   No, it didn't take 10.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.320]   It did not take 10 years.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.960]   The other suit was filed in '98.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.400]   And it was settled in 2001.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.840]   And it was ruled by the judge in 2000.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.920]   So it took only two years for the suit.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.000]   And then another year beyond that
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.440]   to negotiate the terms of the actual settlement
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.120]   rather than appeal.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.560]   Two problems with that analogy, though.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.840]   There's two problems with that analogy.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.920]   First of all, Microsoft's case all along was we can't force
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.240]   anybody to use IE if a better browser comes along.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.000]   People will use it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.560]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   Better browsers came along, two of them.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.680]   And people increasingly are using those browsers.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.440]   The second problem is that Microsoft's monopoly,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.640]   their dominant position, was in the upwards of 90%.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.320]   Market share, Google's going to save Apple
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.360]   from the position of being a monopolist
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.160]   because the Android tablets--
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.800]   Just as Apple saved Microsoft.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.400]   It's some way through being a monopolist.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.200]   Exactly, so Apple is moving away from its dominant position
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.720]   slowly.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   I mean, what is a dominant position?
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.760]   Is 70%?
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   Apple may be a dominant position in tablets,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.360]   but we're talking about e-readers.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.440]   So you have to take in the Kindle, the Sony reader,
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.200]   the Nook, and a half dozen other platforms.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.800]   The best point is that the monopoly position platform
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.840]   is the tablet.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.360]   And the--
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.320]   My problem is I'm not entirely buying into the idea that people
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.240]   that more-- I don't see as many people.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.440]   I mean, I was walking around--
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.280]   Well, I can around--
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.200]   You see a lot of kindles that.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.840]   I saw four kindles the other day.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.080]   A lot of kindles that.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.360]   I don't think I've ever seen anybody reading an e-book--
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.960]   But here's--
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.040]   On an iPad in the wild out in the street.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.240]   Here's the thing, though, is an author.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.920]   Here's what you do.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.440]   You use Microsoft Word to write a manuscript.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   You gather some illustrations or art pictures
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   or something like that.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.280]   And then you go and you send those
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.240]   to your people who create a physical book.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.200]   And then you take those same original materials
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.360]   and you go create a Kindle book.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.120]   And then you take the same original materials
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.280]   and you write a script for an audiobook on Audible.com.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.400]   And then you take the same materials
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   and you do an iBook book.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.800]   And then people can choose--
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.080]   This is a pretty standard--
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.520]   I mean, it's labor intensive, but it's a standard way
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.920]   that authors will put their book on multiple platforms.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.480]   And no matter how restrictive the iBooks thing is,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.240]   it doesn't prevent you from using any or all--
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   Just paste it into the author program, just as you would.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   Exactly.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.680]   And Mike, with all due respect, that's
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.960]   what traditional publishers have been doing for years.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.640]   And in recent years, they have been screwing authors like me.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.320]   Recent things--
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.360]   Publishers have been screwing authors for decades.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.760]   This is not a new concept.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.320]   I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your position,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.640]   but screwing them all--
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   Excellent.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.680]   Let me finish making my point here.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.800]   One of the things that Mike wrote in a post that I unfortunately
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.720]   only had a chance to read two minutes before we went on air
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.640]   was he directed some arguments at me
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.240]   and talked about the significant portion of my income
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.880]   that's coming from books.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.480]   Sorry, Mike, that's not true anymore.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.600]   It used to be true, but it's not true anymore.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.440]   I make the overwhelming portion of my living now
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   from blogging and from consulting.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.040]   The E-books, traditional publishers,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.680]   are screwing authors left and right.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   And that's one of the reasons why my partners and I actually
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.000]   started up a digital first publishing company.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   And you're not alone.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   Almost everybody.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.800]   I talked to Jerry Pournell.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.840]   Everybody is looking at doing this.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   Jerry said this will be the last book that Larry Niven
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   and I write for a publisher.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.080]   So let's go to the next step.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.040]   So Mike's supposition is you'll write this book
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.240]   in some form and then paste it into these different formats.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.000]   Are you saying that Apple's author is so compelling
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.320]   that you'll use those special tools
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.680]   and those special extensions like keynote,
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.800]   proprietary extensions to make the best possible version
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.920]   of your book that will deprecate all the others?
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   In other words, is this gonna draw you, Ed Bod,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   into making books for iBook?
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.560]   No, exactly the opposite is going to make it--
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.320]   Well, so then we don't have to worry.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.560]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.040]   Here, let me see if I can explain
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.640]   what should happen here.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.200]   First of all, it's not as simple as you write a manuscript
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.160]   in Word, you put the right styles on it,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.360]   you generate an ePub and there you go.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.080]   There's a great deal of design and tweaking
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.320]   that has to be done to get a Word manuscript
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.520]   or a pages document turned into--
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.520]   OK, but it's a fraction of the total effort
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.600]   that you put into writing the book.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.760]   It's not.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.160]   It's not a fraction of the--
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.440]   It's not, it's not difficult.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.800]   Actually, it's a significant amount of the work
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.040]   to get a good-looking book.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.480]   See, here's the difference between fiction and--
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.120]   Yeah, because you have a lot of screenshots.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.680]   And--
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.280]   There's a great deal.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.000]   There's a great deal of layout.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.920]   Sidebars, tips, everything has to be--
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.720]   things read on a traditional Kindle like fiction.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.080]   Eh, it's just words that load down the page.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.520]   Right.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.360]   That's easy.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.960]   But for things like textbooks and instructional manuals
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.800]   and anything that has a lot of visuals
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.880]   and has a lot of side elements in it,
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.360]   there's a great deal of production work, the design that
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.920]   goes into it.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.120]   So the workflow for us would have to be--
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.440]   and here's the problem, because Apple's tools will not
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.520]   import an ePub file.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.000]   You have to start with a Word file,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.840]   and then you have to take it into one tool, like Dreamweaver
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.560]   or InDesign.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.160]   And you have to do a whole bunch of work with it over there.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.600]   And then you have to duplicate that work over on the iBooks
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.040]   platform in order to have them--
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.440]   I thought the whole point was to be able to do it right then
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   within their system.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.680]   No, you can't--
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.120]   You can't-- the iBooks author tool
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.320]   will not generate a standard ePub file.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.120]   It will only generate--
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.400]   Right.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.000]   So the only place that I could sell it
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.120]   is on the iBooks store.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.760]   I want to be able to sell my books at Amazon,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.000]   at Barnes & Noble, on my own website,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.800]   and at the iBooks store.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.280]   So what's changed then?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.720]   I mean, it sounds like you're already saying,
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.640]   I write the book and I do significant effort
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.960]   to put it in multiple formats.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.200]   Are you implying somehow that this tool will keep people
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.520]   from using those other formats?
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.280]   That this is going to somehow become the monopoly tool?
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.640]   I mean, otherwise, Apple strategy, evil strategy
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.520]   doesn't work, right?
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.040]   And--
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.800]   Well, you're worried that people will
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.360]   want to use that system.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   And only that system.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.320]   And they won't be able to go anywhere else.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.200]   That's the whole point, correct?
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.760]   That's correct.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.680]   You can't export to a standard format
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.480]   and you can't import from a standard format.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   And so especially for the small publishers
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.440]   who don't have the luxury of being
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.720]   able to double their work to make two different formats,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.320]   they're going to have to choose, do we
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.280]   want to do the interactive iBooks to--
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.480]   And are you saying it's so sexy?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.920]   It's so sexy and Apple made it so good
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.320]   that they'll choose that over the other more open formats?
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.160]   I have no idea.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.600]   My initial experience with it wasn't all that positive.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   But--
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.760]   Because that's the only way-- again,
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.520]   that's the only way it works is if publishers say, oh, good.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.320]   I book, forget these other guys.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.760]   I mean, there are two things going on.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.640]   First of all, Ed Bot's Ed's project
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.960]   is trying to solve a similar problem.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.600]   And it's a great approach.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.400]   So you're making a tool, Ed.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.480]   Ed is making a tool.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   No, I'm not making a tool.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.280]   I publish my-- we publish our own books.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.160]   We're not selling a tool.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.560]   We have our own system.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.720]   What's cool about your proposal to authors
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.200]   is you get 50% as an author.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.280]   And the rest of the cost is all the editing
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.560]   and design and all that stuff.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.240]   And that's an appealing simplified model.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   If you try to do a Kindle book or work with Amazon for print
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.880]   books, it's very complicated.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.720]   The royalty scheme is very muddled,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.160]   and you get screwed in the end.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.880]   And I like that approach of making it really simple
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.640]   and giving authors a lot of half the money.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.520]   I mean, that's a huge amount.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.400]   And Apple's kind of trying to do the same thing.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.040]   They're trying to have a simple--
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.400]   and Apple doesn't want you to go and make multiple versions.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.320]   Believe me, I want you to use one version.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.480]   You want to make an iBook.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.120]   But the real thing you get, in addition to a simplified thing
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.280]   and 70% of the revenue as an author,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.800]   assuming you do all the design work yourself, is the channel.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.880]   I mean, you get the tablet sphere.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.800]   You get the iPad world.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   And that's the powerful.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.880]   Just to take this a little outside baseball, rather
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.920]   than inside baseball, does anyone other than me find it--
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.720]   and I have a four-year-old about to start kindergarten,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.920]   the situation of our relatively well-funded school
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.320]   district is a mess.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.000]   Anybody other than me find it difficult to see iPads actually
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.080]   being adopted other than in really expensive private
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.440]   universities?
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.960]   One of the things I was surprised Apple didn't announce
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.000]   any program to seed schools.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.880]   I mean, they have educational programs already.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.520]   But I would have thought that would have been the fourth and final
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.760]   part of this announcement is--
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.440]   and we're going to make it possible for every school to have
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:30.800]   an iBook.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.680]   Well, I mean, I partially bring this up
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.200]   because I got--
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.120]   --in a way.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   --walked to be expensive, I guess.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.120]   Well, I got one of the funniest--
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.720]   and this is almost a decade ago, one of the funniest PR
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.960]   pitches I ever got was this incredibly adamant person
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   from the education department inside of--
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.480]   sort of the PR department that was handling education
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.640]   inside of Apple-- this was a long time ago.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.440]   But they donated a classroom full of computers
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.120]   in New York City.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:54.920]   And I said, that's great.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.520]   She's like, it's going to change everything.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.840]   I'm like, ma'am, are you familiar with New York City
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.360]   school districts?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   She's like, no, I'm like, I worked in the New York City
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.760]   school district.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.520]   One in every eight residents of New York City to five boroughs
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.920]   is in the New York City school district.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.160]   That's approximately 1.1 million students.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.840]   I think it is commendable that you donated 24 computers
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.640]   to a classroom.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.480]   But this is not going to change.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.880]   That's a lot of the New York City public school system.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.760]   Let me ask you this, Ed, because this is really
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.600]   the fundamental question.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.760]   You're saying the government should intervene.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.480]   Do you think that market forces are not enough
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.160]   to make sure that this--
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.080]   I mean, is the market going to say, oh, I books.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.400]   We're all going to do it, and that's that.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.080]   No, obviously not.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.360]   And Apple would like it to be that way.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.600]   But here's actually what I'd really like to see.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.920]   And this is what I wrote at the end of the post
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.200]   that I published today.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.880]   In a truly fair competitive marketplace,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.320]   what Apple should be doing is they
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   should be saying, we believe we have a product with our iBooks
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   2 format that is better, more interesting,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.920]   and more compelling than a standard plain vanilla ebook.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:09.960]   So if they had created their tool so that you could create
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.040]   your standard--
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.560]   you create your word file or your page file, import it,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.680]   and then output two files.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.560]   One is a standard e-pop file, which you could sell anywhere
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.360]   you wanted.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.200]   The other would be an iBook 2.0 file, which could only be sold
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.280]   on the iBook store.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.600]   That's a good idea.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.760]   At the same price, then the marketplace really and truly
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.880]   would have an opportunity to decide.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.640]   And under those circumstances, if I had an iPad,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.560]   and I had a choice between buying my static plain vanilla
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.360]   book from Amazon or for the exact same price, one that
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.800]   has interactive multimedia content from Apple,
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   I would be very tempted to buy Apple's product.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.600]   Now I have to say pages, Apple's word processor.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.680]   I believe--
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.080]   let me just pull up something here--
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.840]   does save out as e-pop 3.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.640]   So maybe Apple is giving you that choice.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.080]   Maybe you create it in pages.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.800]   Now you've got e-pop 3.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   And then you can then import it into author and do--
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.080]   they're Apple e-pop 3.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.320]   Would that be adequate to you?
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.640]   I mean, that's--
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.240]   see, there it is.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.280]   There's e-pop.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.840]   I can save as an e-pop document that
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.880]   could be read in e-books.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.400]   It is that lower format compatible e-pop that
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.000]   doesn't have all those extra features.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   There you go.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.600]   And you see, this is where this might be fine for the self
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.000]   publisher, but for a professional publisher,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.760]   there's a lot of work that we have
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.480]   to do to get--
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.960]   the output from that file is a good start.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.880]   Well, you're going to have kind of the same problem
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.840]   if you do it in author because there's a lot of work--
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.920]   I mean, you can't just say, OK, I'm
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.480]   going to create a dumbed-down format and a full format
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.560]   automatically.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.320]   That's a lot of work, too, right?
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.280]   I mean--
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.520]   I don't know if a program could even do that.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.440]   I think Apple is going to come back to you.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.640]   Let me be Mr. Apple.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.160]   Hi.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.840]   OK.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.200]   I'm going to come back to you and say, well, Mr. Bot,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.400]   we do create--
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.840]   we do have a program that will let
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.600]   you create those fine, standard e-pub documents.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.760]   It's called Pages.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.480]   It's $40.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.840]   We make that available to you.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.760]   And if you want to have a more elaborate thing,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.960]   you can create it in Pages and then export into author.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.400]   And then now you can have the higher.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.480]   Standard now, we give you the best of both worlds.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.200]   What's wrong with that?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.000]   Again, because the output--
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.520]   I haven't tested the output of Pages,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.720]   but I would be shocked if it were any better.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.160]   I mean, you can get the same output from a Word file.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.040]   And with a few macros, turn it into an e-pub file.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.520]   You then need to do a lot of work
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.400]   to get it into a true e-book format.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.440]   So you're saying Apple is really kind of by creating
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.280]   a really spectacularly good jewel.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.640]   They're coercing people.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.320]   And then making a jeweler around it that says,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.720]   by the way, you can only make stuff for us.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.600]   They're coercing people by saying, look,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.360]   here's a really shiny, lovely tool.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:17.960]   Use this.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.880]   Use this.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.240]   And be part of our universe.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.440]   Well, and especially if they hadn't started from day one,
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.720]   bragging about how the e-pub format is iBooks.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.680]   How the industry leading e-pub format is--
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.080]   And as you point out in your article,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.720]   Apple does have a way of doing this.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   They did it with FaceTime.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.280]   They said nobody reads until they had an iBooks.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.800]   And then all of a sudden people are reading again.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.200]   Apple lies.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.760]   And don't forget that the e-pub format also works on--
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.920]   as a native format on most Android devices.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   So cutting the e-pub format off at the knees
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.920]   also does a good job of subverting things with Google as well.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.440]   Well, what's good for Apple is good for America.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.080]   And China.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.400]   And China.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.480]   Keep in mind that we are really at the beginning stages
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.720]   of self-publishers and e-books.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.360]   And so I mean, I think he's doing a very good thing
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:25.320]   by bringing delight the concerns of a professional author.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.720]   So I know the chat room is kind of going a little crazy
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.840]   in terms of what does this mean to them.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.760]   But I think it's a good discussion.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   Well, what is--
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   But we are still in the beginning stages.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.360]   And so I think we have a lot of room to grow.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.960]   What if a lot of these people in the chat room
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   are amateurs who create wonderful iBook--
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.560]   I mean, I would like-- for instance, the first thing I
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.960]   think what I saw author was, oh, I could now
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.360]   make a book that tells how we built the studio with video
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   in it, and graphics, and diagrams, and text, and audio.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.040]   And they can make this rich book that I've always wanted to make.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.280]   And I can give it away.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.480]   Or maybe I could charge a couple of bucks,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.920]   put it on the iBooks store.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.360]   And I think that that's--
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.560]   I mean, if I'm Apple, I think don't you want more of that
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.120]   and less of the professionals, or maybe not?
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   Is Apple's right?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.960]   And the only place where you can read that is on the iPad.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.880]   Right.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.800]   It sells iPads.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.480]   I don't think Apple is looking at Apple's in the content,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.000]   creation, and consumption business.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.480]   And essentially, this is an attack on Amazon.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.040]   Amazon--
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.280]   And Google.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.720]   Decided to be a competitor to iTunes, to offer downloadable
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.600]   movies.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   And then it came out with a tablet so that you could use all--
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.720]   I mean, it's exactly an Apple's business model.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.920]   And this is Apple, the Empire Strikes Back, where,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.440]   essentially, what they're doing is they're starting with
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.280]   the educational market.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.400]   Forget about paper books.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.280]   That's the past.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   They're competing with--
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.840]   Let's start over.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.800]   --for the future.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.240]   And for publishers who do--
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.880]   for the disintermediation business, the writers who want
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.360]   to connect with the readers through Apple--
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   many of those writers, by the way, start with Macs.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.880]   And many of those readers are using iPads or Will in the
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   future.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.760]   And Apple essentially wants to control it because it's
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.160]   content.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.760]   Everything that's content, Apple wants to control it just
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.160]   like they did music in iTunes.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   That's what the company does.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.000]   They do it with hardware.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.280]   They do it with app stores.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.800]   They do it with all these things.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.760]   But this is--
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.720]   books are content.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.440]   And Apple considers that to be their primary business.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.840]   Well, we can't let them do that.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   So the best solution is for Amazon to create an
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.560]   authoring tool and Google to create an authoring tool.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.240]   Would that solve the problem, Ed?
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.000]   What I don't want to do is get the government involved.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.920]   I just don't think that DOJ is the right person to solve
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.600]   this problem.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.480]   No, I wish they had created a truly competitive tool,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.840]   something that would--
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.440]   But it's not in their interest.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.240]   --increase.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.840]   Of course, it's not in their interest, but it would be in
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.920]   my interest, what I see.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.000]   When you run Apple, you can do that.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.120]   In my interest as a reader and in my interest as a consumer,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.400]   in your interest in our--
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.360]   The good-- I agree.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.960]   And I'm completely with you on that.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.280]   The good news is there are other open source tools.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:09.920]   There's caliber.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.440]   There are some tools out there.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.960]   And I think we as readers should be very cognizant of the
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.240]   fact that Apple is essentially wants to co-op a very good
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.200]   format, the ePub format, and make it proprietary, make it
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.280]   their own.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.760]   It's also funny that we're having this--
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.400]   I mean, I was mocked soundly by three members of the
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.200]   panel, and I'm like, I still buy CDs.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.840]   I own a physical copy of it.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.680]   It's the most raw form of the music I can get, and I don't
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.920]   have to worry about being shut down or losing access to it,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.520]   or my monthly fee going away, or the company I go with,
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.440]   losing their licensing or something.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.200]   And here we are having this conversation kind of poo-pooing
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.040]   whether or not--
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.680]   Because the idea of, as a college student, it would suck
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.200]   to have your textbooks locked down to an iPad.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.240]   I keep all my music and all my textbooks on mega uploads.com.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.000]   I know where they are.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   Let's talk about that.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.200]   Let's talk about that in just a second.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   We got a great panel and some great conversations.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.280]   I want to find out why Ed Botts never going back to CES.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.240]   I want to find out whether we won in SOPA or whether that
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.440]   was just the first battle and actually--
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.000]   Here comes ACTA, the cavalry.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.040]   We can talk about Chris Dodd of the Motion Picture Association
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.760]   of America.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.080]   There's a lot to talk about, and mega upload is one of them.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   We will do all of that in just a moment.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.160]   But first, let's say hello to our friends at Ford.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.560]   You can see, actually, if you look out the window,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.320]   can you see my Mustang parked right out there, right out front?
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   Say goodbye to the gasoline engine in my Mustang,
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.120]   because I'm going all electric, baby.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   So is Ford.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.240]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.160]   If you go to Ford.com/technology,
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.880]   you can learn a lot about what Ford is up to with their state
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.520]   of the art 21st century vehicles.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.640]   And one of the things Ford's working hard on--
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.080]   I know Patrick, you and I were there at that dinner
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.800]   with Alan Malawi.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.320]   He said a very interesting thing.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   Somebody asked him, well, did you miss the boat?
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   Nissan and others have come up with electric vehicles.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.880]   Where is Ford?
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.720]   They're like, we're giving consumers the choice
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.080]   by a Ford gas engine, turbocharged gas engine,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.600]   diesel engine, electric engine, hybrid technology,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.800]   and offering them in the car so that people can choose
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.600]   whatever engine they want.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.880]   All the same assembly line.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.000]   I was like, all of them, please.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   It's brilliant.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.560]   Ford's decided to do a more global strategy
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.520]   with all their vehicles.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.400]   And as a result, yeah, you're now just starting
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.840]   to see the 2012 electric focus.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.440]   It's you can get another reservation list as I am right now.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.840]   Next year, the 2013 C-Max Energy plug-in hybrid.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.480]   But essentially, as time goes by,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.920]   you're going to see plug-in hybrids, hybrids, electric,
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.960]   diesel, and gas.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.080]   I don't know about diesel in the US.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.920]   We asked about diesel.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.800]   He said, well, the regulatory situation here
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.680]   makes it tough to--
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.960]   Actually, mostly in old places.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.680]   And price is ultimately a real ruin diesel
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.600]   for consumer cars in the United States.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.440]   It's just depressing.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.920]   And diesel's not cheaper here, either, which is another issue.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.080]   But speaking of inside baseball conversations,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.680]   I can talk for $10 on diesel.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.040]   I know.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.000]   I don't want to get you started on cars.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.160]   I'm excited.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.120]   Particularly, actually, now I'm looking at this plug-in hybrid.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.640]   Because the idea is you plug it in, you charge it up.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.520]   You've got a limited range, like 15 miles.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.280]   But if you're just popping around town, you use zero gas.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.040]   But you have the range when you need it.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.920]   If you have to go to San Francisco, I have the range to do.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.240]   It's kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.280]   And this is also-- now you're starting
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.200]   to see the strategy come together.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.680]   This guy is a strategist.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.760]   Now you see why Sync and MyFord touch
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.880]   were so important, why the app link is so important.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.400]   Because now you see apps on your smartphone that
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.720]   manage the recharge process.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.040]   In car, you can determine the most eco-friendly driving route.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.440]   Fastest, shortest, or least energy consumed.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.080]   You can remotely control the vehicle charge.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.160]   You can even make sure the vehicle only charges
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.240]   during the lowest utility rate hours.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.440]   Maximize efficiency, monitor the state of charge.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.760]   All of this, using Sync and MyFord touch,
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.880]   it's just brilliant.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.080]   And the MyFord mobile smartphone app.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   So there really is a whole strategy here.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.160]   And also, of course, the thing I'd like about the focus
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.320]   charges in three to four hours, if you get the Leviton home
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.520]   charging station, the 240 volt station.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.480]   So I get home, I plug it in three or four hours later.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.040]   I'm out and driving around.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.200]   Zero emissions, 100% electric for the Ford Focus Electric.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.080]   They use lithium ion, you can top it off.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.640]   That's nice.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.960]   So you don't have to wait till I've driven--
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   I have to drive around the block a few times.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.480]   Discharge the battery, just top it off.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.160]   And then next year, the C-Max Energy plug-in hybrid.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.440]   I'm just excited about this.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.880]   Find out more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.000]   Get on the list for your Ford Focus Electric.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Go to your Ford dealer and drive one.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   You will love it.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And of course, Ford.com/technology to find out.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.280]   How a car company, like Ford, has become a 21st century car
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.640]   company.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.040]   I just think it's so exciting.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.800]   I wish Apple would license their technology,
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.320]   because that's better battery life and charging time
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.400]   than my iPhone 4S.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.880]   I know.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.640]   Well, you realize, of course, it's Microsoft car
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.040]   and the base operating system there.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.280]   I imagine that Google and Apple are eyeing this telematics
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.760]   space as a real opportunity.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.280]   I don't know.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.440]   There is Linux in some vehicles, right?
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.280]   Some cars are using it.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.200]   There's a lot of operating systems in here.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.000]   Yeah, for cars.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.680]   It's very interesting.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.640]   I thought it was funny at CES, I'm looking at the Samsung.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.400]   It has a camera on top.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.880]   It recognizes when you come in, knows
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.440]   who Patrick's settings are different than my settings.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.120]   You can gesture at it.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.840]   You can talk to it.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.240]   And it's got dual-core processors.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.000]   The thing is a PC.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.320]   What operating system-- you said that everybody's proprietary
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   now, and these apps--
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.800]   Callie, I think you were saying that.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.280]   Callie was saying that.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.640]   Is there any standard across?
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.200]   No, everybody's different.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.400]   Everyone's using their own thing.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.880]   And it's very frustrating for, I think, every consumer out
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.240]   there.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.320]   But it seems like companies are definitely moving direction.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.720]   And I'm not sure that they're going to stop, regardless
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.560]   of what we think.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.200]   You know, I thought it was interesting, Sam's son.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.840]   I don't know.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.160]   Ford was talking about this, too.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.640]   We're so used to upgrading our phones and our computers
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.000]   like on a regular basis, like yearly.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.840]   And durable goods like TVs and cars
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   are realizing that consumers want an upgrade.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.640]   They don't want to buy a new TV or car every year,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   but they want to upgrade.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.280]   Samsung has a module on their TVs.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.040]   Or is it LG?
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.760]   Might be LG that was doing this.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.560]   You unplus--
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.120]   Samsung.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.040]   It was Samsung.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.000]   And it's a new processor, a new scaler.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.280]   Well, it's software.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.680]   And you just upgrade the TV.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.760]   There's kind of a different issue.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.800]   So television sales, average television
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.480]   lasted an American home for 11 years.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.360]   Right?
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.040]   That's changed.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.440]   And then HTTPs came out.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.680]   And then there was the mess of the competing standards.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.440]   And early adopters kind of got hosed.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.640]   And it settles in on 1080p.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   And all of a sudden, it goes from the average household
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.440]   having a television for 11 years to two HD TVs inside
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.000]   of like four years to OK, all of a sudden,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.240]   the HTTP adoption rate is starting to slow it down.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.600]   As everybody's getting 1080p, 1080p televisions
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.760]   are getting cheap.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.840]   People have put them in a couple of rooms in the house.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.280]   And they're kind of done.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.760]   And so--
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.840]   That's the problem, saturated.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.920]   The consumer electronics, they want you to--
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.760]   That's-- they can't--
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.120]   You can't stop buying?
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.520]   We've got 3D.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   You're going to watch "Blue People in the 3D."
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.000]   I don't want--
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.760]   I don't want anything.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.520]   No, I don't want anything.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.000]   How 8K TV.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.320]   Well, "Breathing Gestures."
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.600]   How about gestures?
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.160]   No, no, I don't want that.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.520]   I don't want that.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.360]   What else you got?
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.280]   Well, how about this thing so you can watch Netflix and 1080p?
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.560]   No, no, no, I don't want that.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.720]   There's special glasses, right?
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.200]   The 3D is actually 2D.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.280]   Because nobody likes 3D.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.760]   I like my TV.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.320]   I don't want--
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:37.880]   OLED.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.080]   Oh, I'll take that.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.840]   Well, sure.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.600]   I'll take that.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   You can afford it.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.680]   The rest of us have waited two years.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.160]   How much?
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.040]   Oh, never mind.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.760]   So, Callie, you're right.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.080]   We saw 4K and 8K.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.040]   I mean--
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.520]   Not that there's anything you could--
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   So, right, there was a now--
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.600]   --there are 8K TV.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.560]   And, geez, we haven't even seen 4K.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   They had to get--
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.320]   They're already making me frustrated with 4K.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.560]   They had to get Nipon Television and HK
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.840]   to record special 8K--
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.520]   But don't you remember, like, three or four years
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.840]   or six years of CES where you were like, oh, yeah.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.600]   And the "Rore Soring Ego" demo--
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.880]   There would be these amazing HDTV demos of "Soring Eagles."
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.200]   And you'd look at the individual hairs on the--
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.280]   And you'd be sitting there staring.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.960]   And this year, it was like--
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.160]   Robert Harris was like, yeah, I sat down and looked at an 8K
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.800]   project for JVC and I stared at it for like 4 millimeters
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   away.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.680]   And it was amazing.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.080]   And I went 4K content in my house.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.840]   And it's like, well, what about-- it's an 8K.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.800]   It's like, yeah, well, OK.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.320]   So the Wizard of Oz has been scanned in 8K.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.800]   That's one.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   There is a--
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.360]   Film.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.480]   Film is high-- is high--
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.000]   --resilutes.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.680]   Some.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.880]   Film itself is high resolution.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.120]   19 freaking 30 million.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.600]   Yeah, but it was film.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.360]   Film itself captures more data than we've had.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.880]   And then we just re-digitize all those classics.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.560]   Because they've done such a good job
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.120]   getting them on the Blu-ray.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:48.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.760]   It took five years to get Blu-ray up to speed.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.960]   Let's move everybody.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.480]   Perfect.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.080]   Leo, we're all going to have to buy 4K TVs.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.120]   You are making the Consumer Electronics Association
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.640]   so happy.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.040]   I don't want to know what it is.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.240]   Yeah, until you see one, then you're going to own two.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.560]   And then the prices can drop.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.840]   And the rest of us can buy it.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.040]   Because it's hard to describe 4K TV.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.240]   It's such a gorgeous thing.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.920]   I mean, even if you can't tell which a lot of people can't,
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.520]   the difference between 720 and 1080,
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.320]   you can absolutely tell the difference between 720 or 1080
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.400]   and 4K is just--
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.360]   It's like I want to--
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.160]   It's like looking through a window.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.000]   It's a 55-inch retinal display is what it is.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.480]   But the truth is, the only person who will look good
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.120]   on a 4K TV is Callie Lewis.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.240]   The rest of us, you do not want to see
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.280]   at that kind of resolution.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   So Ed, why are you not going back to CES ever again?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.720]   By the way, every one of us says that every year.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   No.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.640]   I didn't say-- no, I never said never again.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.760]   I said, I'm not going back next year.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.640]   Why not?
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:54.520]   Well, because the whole CES experience is so noisy.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.640]   And the timing is such that most of the exhibitors
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.520]   are showing either stuff that they introduced sometime
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.360]   in the last six months or stuff that they may or may not
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.040]   actually ship in the next six months to six years.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.640]   And there's almost no current news value to it.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   That's kind of the beauty of CES.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.160]   I agree.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.640]   Come on.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   I mean, it's all about getting to see
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.440]   where the future of technology is going.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.240]   And just remember, Callie is--
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.120]   Maybe you get the clue.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.160]   Just remember Ed, Callie is 20 years younger than us.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.560]   Remember 20 years ago how you felt about Commdex?
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.040]   That's how Callie feels.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.520]   Well, I went to my first CES in 1979.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.080]   Yeah, we're old and jaded.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   That's the problem.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.160]   I wasn't even more in that.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.160]   Exactly.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:51.320]   So I think it's a great way to get a snapshot of the industry.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.280]   You got hordes-- there were 50 people from CNET
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.440]   who were there, fanned out, gathering everything.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.840]   So I plan next year to be--
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.440]   On a beach in Hawaii with a notebook and Wi-Fi,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.480]   checking as someone curates it for me.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.240]   That's what Devorak and Pournell and everybody.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.360]   All us old farts say, we'll let Callie do it.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.120]   And we'll watch you, Callie, go.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:17.640]   You're young.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.000]   I will be happy to serve that.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.240]   I know.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.040]   Actually, it was a little scary when you saw the Verge at 35.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.320]   People in gadget at 35.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.160]   People seen it at 50, 50 people.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.440]   I felt like, how can we cover this in a way that
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.840]   is going to be different and unique?
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.200]   It is a little bit of a challenge.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.840]   Well, in your coverage of the press event on Sunday
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.480]   was exactly like being at the press event.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.000]   I mean, it was--
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.560]   I wouldn't know.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.800]   They didn't let me in.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   But it was just-- I mean, walking around on the booth.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.480]   I mean, I got--
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.400]   Don't feel badly ill.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.720]   I couldn't get in either.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.600]   No, that was what we decided we wanted to do,
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.760]   was to simulate the experience of actually being there.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.520]   If you could-- If you could necessarily try to be coherent,
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.720]   cogent, informational--
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.840]   Well, just give you the raw experience.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.120]   If you could simulate the experience of drinking free
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.040]   alcohol and eating shrimp, that would be ideal.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.800]   Well, you'll have to provide your own alcohol and shrimp.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.560]   That's expensive.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.960]   Where was all of that?
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.360]   I didn't see any of it.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.640]   Callie, you were just stuck in a booth somewhere probably
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.240]   working, working.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.760]   Anyway, we love doing it.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.200]   But it is a little over-covered these days, isn't it?
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.160]   I mean, it's just everybody--
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.840]   still, all of us still moved unbelievable numbers
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.120]   of page views or--
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.600]   --ridiculous numbers of videos.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.040]   People-- well, I guess that's true,
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.280]   that just as there are more people covering it,
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.640]   there are more people interested in it.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.320]   I mean, the audience, I mean, we had huge views.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.560]   I think we posted 35 or 40 videos for Tekzilla.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.200]   Holy cow.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.760]   Callie, you guys did another 300 videos.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   50 one.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   50 one.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.200]   And then we also had Soltrano's best, and Ty was down there,
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.960]   and the techno buffalo, and everybody's getting huge numbers.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.640]   The techno buffalo and Soltrano's best were there.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.400]   Oh, no.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   I'm in trouble now.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.320]   Who the hell's that?
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.600]   Well, these are people--
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.560]   OK, first of all, thank you for dissing some of my partners
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.320]   at Revision 3.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.680]   But those are Revision 3 shows?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.560]   These are YouTube people.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.080]   These are people who published primarily on YouTube.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.040]   Who are partner at Revision 3.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.760]   They're probably much bigger than ours, yeah.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.000]   Although I have to say, I think a YouTube audience of a million
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.360]   is a little deceptive.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.960]   Well, because it's like 12-year-olds who watch it over and over.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.640]   Guess who's got the highest per capita percentage
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.360]   of disposable income to drop on new shiny--
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   12-year-olds.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.120]   Yup.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.640]   That's scary.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.160]   12 to 20-year-olds.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.560]   They don't have ex-wives.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.880]   They don't have mortgages.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.400]   They don't have car payments.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.720]   They don't have responsibility.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.880]   They can go wear in the same pair of jeans for three weeks
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.440]   if they want to if they're that slovenly.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.520]   And they can spend it all on ringtones and new phones.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.720]   They're the ideal consumer.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.840]   They want to create loyal customers out of.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.440]   I mean, they're going for that young market, of course,
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.680]   rather than people who've been around for a while.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.960]   Everybody in our chat room knows who Tech--
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.280]   Techno-- what is it?
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.120]   Techno Buffalo?
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:08.960]   Techno Buffalo.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.440]   They know who he is in soldier.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.680]   And they all know they're going, oh, Leo.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.560]   You're just so out of it, man.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.160]   So let's talk about McGouplode.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.360]   And what's his name?
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   Kim.com.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.560]   Kim.com.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   Kim.com.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.440]   Is that the Kim Jung-eel of the file trading set?
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:26.800]   Oh, man.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.680]   I believe it is.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.760]   I believe it is.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   Actually, this is his third name, except he's
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.680]   three times taller than Kim Jung-eel.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.240]   It would be hard.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.600]   Six foot seven and we use 300 pounds.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.320]   He's a gigantic human name.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.280]   So the day we celebrated victory Wednesday
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.560]   over SOPA and PIPA.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.280]   29 members of Congress were candid.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.920]   Eventually, both sponsors of the House and Senate bill
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.440]   pulled the bills off the table, said, all right, all right.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.880]   You internet creeps win.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.800]   But the very next day, what happens?
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.200]   The feds come down hard on megaupload.com.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.680]   This is interesting.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.120]   Look, we all want piracy stop.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   We don't want counterfeit brake pads causing my truck
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.360]   to fly into a tree at 300 miles an hour.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   We all want people--
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   That just sounds awesome.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.200]   Yeah, it does.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   Wow.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.360]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.920]   I'm sure you make a video of that.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.840]   It's going to go huge on the YouTube.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.440]   On the YouTube.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.040]   But it's interesting.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.000]   While everybody's making this huge furah,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.440]   Google's blacked out their logo.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.520]   Wikipedia is down.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.600]   1,000 other sites participated by going down.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.000]   We went black and white back there.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.960]   We blackened white.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.040]   That was fun.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.200]   We should just do that for now.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.560]   It just looks no longer.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.760]   It's good.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.800]   You should all start smoking cigarettes.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.160]   It's like the madmen.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.080]   The problem is, outside of madmen in the 21st century,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.960]   smoking cigarettes is the number one indicator
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.320]   that you're a bad guy in modern drama.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.560]   Or using a Windows computer.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   But literally, while SOPA is being battled over,
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   they're making arrests on multiple continents.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.280]   A German national living in New Zealand
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.280]   is being taken down by New Zealand police
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.560]   for extradition to the United States.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.480]   Based on a file uploading service,
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.280]   we just had lots and lots of legitimate users.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.880]   But IP holders claim was primarily
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.040]   used for violating copyright.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.560]   And what it seems to come down to
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.960]   is the more you dig into this,
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.800]   more comes down to is they got into their communications,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.920]   found them acknowledging that there were really good ways
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.960]   to take advantage of this,
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.840]   to get all the television shows they wanted to watch.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.720]   And that became the core of a multinational operation.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.120]   A multi, just a absolutely phenomenally huge operation
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.000]   to take mega upload offline.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.520]   - Yeah. - Kim.com is the--
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.000]   - I'm working on this.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.840]   Do you know?
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.800]   - I haven't quite figured out.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.720]   - Must've been a long time.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.200]   - Apparently, a .com barricaded himself
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.880]   in his mansion safe room.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.160]   He had a Heidi hole.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.000]   - Yeah. - This is like,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.240]   this is like an shotgun. - And a shotgun.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.560]   - And his sawed off shotgun.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.880]   - Okay, first of all, this is a really wonderful Yahoo title
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.160]   that's pulling a lot of views.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.440]   And I gotta say, I've met some people of wealth.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.240]   Some of them travel around with gigantic ex-marines.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.520]   Some of them have safe holes in their houses.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.800]   If I was a, if people--
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.840]   - Here's three, here's-- - Here's three,
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.480]   if I had 18 luxury vehicles worth $4.8 million,
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.400]   including several Mercedes, a 2012 Maserati,
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.280]   and a 2008 Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe,
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.120]   and a 1959 pink Cadillac.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.960]   - Convertible. - I saw that
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.600]   being towed away from the compound.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.240]   - There's a place in this place,
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.280]   including God, Mafia,
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.760]   Stoned, CEO, Good, Evil, Hacker.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.360]   - And police. - Anybody who will leave.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.680]   - There was one said police. - One said police.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.320]   Now, here's the thing, he's the, he's the,
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.080]   he's a Mo Market Offie of-- - No?
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.920]   - File shares. - No?
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.640]   - He's a bigger-than-life character.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.560]   They, what they say that they have is evidence that not only
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.720]   did he and his fellow German and Dutch co-runners
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.640]   of the company know there was illegal file sharing.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.240]   - They celebrate it. - They were doing it.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.240]   - Yeah. - They were saying,
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.920]   hey, can you get me this TV series?
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.400]   Oh yeah, let me go grab it from over here on Mega Uploads.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.240]   - Right. - There are--
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.640]   - And there's an email smoking gun apparently.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.800]   - Yeah, yeah, so this is a ridiculously poorly run business.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.240]   There's all kinds of shady things about the site itself.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.720]   You can't search it.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.520]   There's no archive or index.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.000]   - Apparently they can search it, but you can't--
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   - They can search it. - Well, you could say the same thing
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.040]   for many file services out there.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.560]   - Yeah, but the difference-- - So given the information
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:41.520]   that's come out about their interest in it
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.440]   and them using it themselves,
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.000]   so are we saying basically that you send it
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.960]   and other file sharing services aren't really at risk?
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.200]   - Well, I think they are, in fact--
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.120]   - 'Cause I think that was the concern originally.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.880]   - Didn't two sites pull themselves down today?
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.240]   Well, there's a couple of issues.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.720]   One is a lot of people complaining on Twitter,
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.640]   hey, I didn't use it for piracy,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.240]   I used megaupload.com to store my work files.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.840]   What do I do now?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.120]   - Right, 'cause they're gone. - No, legitimate people
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.760]   had stuff just disappear.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.480]   - Yeah, and file Sonic, if you go there now,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.000]   says all sharing functionality is disabled,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.560]   our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.840]   that you have uploaded personally.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.240]   If I were you, I probably wouldn't use file Sonic right now.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.440]   That's not the only one.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:40.760]   Uploaded.to is no longer available for use in the US.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.320]   - Oh, Chase.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.400]   - Well, if I were them, I'd do the same thing.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:48.280]   - Yeah, I mean, I really do think that they were trying
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.560]   to make an example out of somebody who looks really bad.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   The guy has a long history of shady hacking,
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.520]   the hacking of the sites. - This was an easy--
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.680]   - This was an easy-- - This was an easy--
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.480]   - Exactly, and once they nail this guy,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.520]   then they can go to the next company and say,
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.520]   "Well, you guys are just like megalplodes.com,"
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.880]   and that was acceptable, so now this should be acceptable.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.720]   And that also assumes that they get it through the--
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   Either he plea bargains or they get it through the courts
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.160]   and it upholds and they consider this--
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.520]   'Cause there's a lot of, you know--
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.800]   - You know, it's not illegal to be eccentric,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.840]   to be big, to be broad.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.320]   They've got to prove that--
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.440]   'Cause they had a DMCA takedown system.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.600]   They got to prove that these guys knowingly flouted it.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.120]   - And allowed it. - And it's not--
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - This is not,
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.640]   you're right, this is not a slam dunk.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.960]   However, the message has clearly been sent.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.800]   - Right.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.840]   - But like so many of these cases,
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.000]   it's all about harvesting email,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.200]   because, and the bigger the company,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.800]   the more this works, but you can,
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.120]   if you can get your hands on email,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.520]   which you always can in these cases,
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.480]   and just search it and data mine it,
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.080]   you can always find anything you're looking for
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:54.920]   just about.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.560]   Somebody said something, somebody was drinking
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.000]   and typed some email and said something,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.400]   and they bring it into court and say,
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.240]   hey look, you know, there's this proof that they--
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   - Right. - Are watching
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.640]   some of those bags, yeah.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.520]   Now, I didn't know, if any of you has used Mega Upload,
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.880]   'cause I had never used it,
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   I'm sure everybody in our chat room uses it.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.720]   Apparently--
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.120]   - Some of the people in my office have, but I haven't.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.720]   - According to ours, Technica,
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.920]   more data, more file downloading,
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.440]   or more bandwidth was used,
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.920]   corporate business bandwidth used by Mega Upload
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.800]   than Dropbox.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.920]   - Well, but it's interesting,
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.320]   there's a company that does kind of third party analysis
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.000]   of smoke and gateways, and they were looking at--
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   - How about the networks?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:32.840]   - How about the networks,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.880]   and they were looking at sort of box.net
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.600]   versus Dropbox versus Mega Upload,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.560]   and it's kind of funny, they're like,
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.440]   there's like, in the same,
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.360]   there should be some actual specific listing,
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.320]   but the numbers are like, yeah,
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.760]   business-focused box.net, 86 gigabytes,
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.160]   11,573 gigabytes for Dropbox,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.240]   going through the gateway,
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.280]   20,405 gigabytes from Mega Upload,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.400]   roughly 50% of the networks of--
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.240]   - 20% of the--
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.080]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.400]   - So box.net, in terms of bandwidth,
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.440]   box.net, 87, 86 gigabytes.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.480]   - Gigabytes.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.680]   - Mega Upload, 20,405 gigabytes.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   - And this is like basically Mega Upload,
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.800]   and it's a line right there.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.200]   - This is our business traffic, by the way,
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.560]   this is not consumers.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.680]   57% of the 1,636 organizations in the study,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.680]   57% of them had Mega Upload traffic.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.960]   Here's the reason, the bigger the file,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.000]   and the longer you want it to be available,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.520]   the better Mega Uploads is.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.360]   - Okay.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.200]   - Because you can leave it up for,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.920]   you can have Upload an gigantic file,
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.360]   and leave it up for six months,
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.520]   and it's available with the URL.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.040]   - Now I'd love to see a study that says
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.880]   how much of Mega Uploads content was pirated content.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.040]   By the way, one of the examples they gave
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.560]   of the internal search,
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.760]   one of the executives sent an email,
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.280]   said, "I'd like some episodes of Seinfeld."
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.200]   Now, admittedly, the people who own Seinfeld
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.040]   have the right to say,
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.920]   "I don't want Seinfeld on Mega Upload."
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.160]   But honestly, can you prove any financial damage
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.520]   to the fact that Seinfeld is on Mega Upload?
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.160]   - But that proves that they knew
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   that it was available on Mega Uploads.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.000]   - Right, it's a smoking gun,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.920]   because using it demonstrates they knew it was there,
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.080]   and they can also demonstrate they didn't take it down
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.120]   when they found out it was there.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.440]   - Of the top 20 file downloads found on December 5th, 2011
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.760]   by Palo Alto, six of the files were software applications
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.640]   pirated, eight were games or game demos,
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.800]   get demos that'd be legal, but games would not.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.760]   - Well, you're assuming.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.120]   - Six were movie trailers, not one was a television show,
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:33.940]   movie.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:39.760]   So we, you know, I'm not sure.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.520]   Are these really, I mean, admittedly,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.480]   they look like bad guys.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.720]   But are they really bad guys?
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.680]   Are they really so very different than box.net or Dropbox?
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.880]   And who's next?
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.160]   I understand why these other sites are shutting themselves down.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.360]   - Well, there's Mega Upload, and there's Rapid Share,
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.920]   there's another company that's in there.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.640]   - I've seen stuff on them, yeah.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.880]   - Yeah, and I think maybe, you know, one difference
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.400]   between box, I think they're box.com now, by the way.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.240]   They finally got that domain.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.080]   - Are they really?
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.520]   - Yeah, yeah, they finally bought that.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.200]   So box and Dropbox are shifting a lot of small files,
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.080]   a lot of Word documents, a lot of Excel spreadsheets
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.920]   and stuff, all the legit stuff.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.760]   That's what they're about is sharing a folder
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.160]   full of constantly updated stuff with other people.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.400]   - That's how he's dropped out.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.040]   - Mega Upload and Rapid Share is how,
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.280]   and I've used them for this before,
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   is when somebody's email provider won't allow
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.520]   an attachment above a certain size,
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.160]   you go, okay, I'm just gonna put it over here
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.000]   and you can get it.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.440]   - You send it, same thing.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.280]   - Yeah, yeah, you just tell you do
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.360]   something like that.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.680]   And a lot of that stuff is perfectly innocent,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.680]   it's just people working around restrictions of mail clients.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.920]   So that's interesting data that they came up with.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:10.240]   I'm not sure that it's really all that conclusive about much.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.080]   - Right.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.120]   - Somebody in the chatroom said, and this is a good point,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:19.120]   that the way a site like Mega Upload
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:24.480]   would make money off piracy is they would pay people
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.520]   to put pirated stuff on there, reward them somehow,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.560]   and then charge people to get the pirated stuff.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.120]   In other words, you need transactions.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.640]   Apparently Mega Upload hasn't done that in months.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.440]   - In months, they used to?
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.400]   - This is from Beatmaster.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.200]   The way it works for pirates usually is a profit system
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.720]   that gives uploaders dollars for the amount of downloads.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.680]   Mega Upload dropped that months ago.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.440]   Now, it may be--
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.120]   - About the time that the investigation--
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.040]   - The investigation, maybe.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.120]   - Yeah, we matter in court.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.880]   - Won't matter in court.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.200]   Won't matter in court.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.720]   - Did they have the premium membership thing
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.000]   that a lot of these services do where it's free,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.040]   but you have to wait 30 or 60 seconds
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.440]   before your download will start?
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.880]   - Right, I'm sure they did that.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.720]   - But if you buy the premium membership,
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.040]   you get a faster rate and you don't have to wait.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.880]   - Right.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.160]   - I remember seeing that a lot.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.000]   - Yes, according to chatroom,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.920]   apparently quite a few of whom use it.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.760]   - Yep.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.560]   - For completely legitimate purposes, it did do that.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   - Seinfeld.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.800]   - I guess the other question is, if this, look at this,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.640]   it worked.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.960]   What do we need soap and pepper for?
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.800]   - We don't.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.640]   They got tools.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.480]   It worked.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.320]   They got them.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.160]   - Do we need anything better than that?
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.320]   New Zealand cooperated.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.440]   I guess what we needed for is if Kim had been smart enough
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.160]   to be located in North Korea with his brother,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   then this wouldn't have been a problem.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.880]   (laughing)
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.720]   Right?
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.640]   That was what, 'cause we were,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.800]   - I don't think Kim's lifestyle is gonna roll
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.240]   very well in North Korea.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.400]   - We have extradition arrangements with New Zealand.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.840]   He should have gone somewhere we didn't.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.120]   Venezuela, Ugo Chavez, probably would welcome the guy.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.040]   Come on in.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.840]   - He has citizenship all over the place
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.480]   and residency is on Kong.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.320]   - Oh, he does.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.640]   - Oh, so he just happened to go somewhere where we could get.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.680]   - Well, his family lives in the family compound
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.320]   in New Zealand, which is apparently the,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.920]   or one of the most expensive homes in New Zealand.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.760]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.600]   - I mean, it's neat.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.440]   - It's worth it.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.600]   - It's worth like $35 million something.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.440]   Huge.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.280]   - Okay.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.840]   - But I think it does underscore, you know,
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.360]   at this point, so I think the MPA and the RA,
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.320]   you know, Chris Dodd, I guess turns around and says,
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.880]   well, you know, we can't get this extraordinary level
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.960]   of cooperation between the Department of Justice,
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.880]   the FBI and our international partners
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.680]   in the battle against piracy.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.280]   Give us the tactical nuke.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.240]   Give us the ability to, 'cause it's, yeah.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.000]   - Yeah, go ahead and talk about Chris Dodd.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.840]   - 'Cause all this stuff.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.720]   - So, uh, Chris Dodd was on Fox.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.840]   And Chris Dodd, Senator from Connecticut.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.680]   - Former. - Former.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.520]   - Former.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.360]   - Long time.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.200]   - Now he's cash in.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.600]   - And yeah, this is what you do in Washington.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.720]   You serve the people for a certain number of years,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.680]   then you go down to K Street, you open an office
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.280]   and you make a big bunch of money as a lobbyist.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.120]   - Then you serve the people on a silver platter
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.960]   to Congress.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.880]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.720]   Thank you.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.120]   - Ah, but Mr. Dodd cannot directly lobby Congress
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.040]   for two years after the end of his election.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.360]   So instead, he basically says,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.680]   if you guys don't vote the way we want you to vote
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.840]   on SOPA or PIPA or anything else,
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.120]   we delete expletive introducing Congress.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.120]   We're not gonna donate any money to your campaign funds.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.200]   - Now this is not illegal.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.320]   This is how it works in this country.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.960]   So he's the chairman and CEO
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.160]   of the Motion Picture Association of America,
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.080]   that wonderful group that Jack Valente used to head.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   Jack Valente was a guy I went in front of Congress
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.920]   who said,
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.280]   - The VCR is to television
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.640]   what the Boston strangler is to a woman home
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.800]   at long at night.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.400]   - Jack Valente was always keeping it classy and real.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.960]   - Well, they found a good successor.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.320]   - Chris Dodd says,
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.600]   those don't do it Leo.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.200]   - Those who count on support.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.200]   - Don't do it Leo.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   - Those who count on quote Hollywood
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.840]   for support need understand.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.920]   This industry is watching very carefully
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   what's who's gonna stand up for them
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.240]   when their job is at stake.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.600]   - And this is my favorite part.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.520]   - Don't ask me to write a check for you
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.440]   when you think your job is at risk.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.560]   In other words, when you're up for reelection.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.680]   - And then don't pay any attention to me
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.320]   when my job is at stake.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.240]   You come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.080]   and you're at,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.280]   I'm sorry, that's another quote.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.760]   That's another movie.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.440]   But this guy, you couldn't get more blatant.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.640]   And it's not illegal 'cause that's how it works.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.800]   - Welcome to America.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.480]   - But even the mafia wouldn't say that.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.440]   - I love the internet before.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.680]   - Well, I mean,
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.120]   - Is he even done email on the internet before?
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.040]   - I think he thought,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.000]   oh, I'm on Fox News, I can say this,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.360]   it'll never go anywhere.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.120]   (laughing)
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.680]   I don't know what he thought.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.840]   And now by the way, there's a petition.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.920]   I'm reading this from the White House petition site.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.080]   We the people petitioning the Obama administration
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.880]   to investigate Chris Dodd
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.120]   and the Motion Picture Association of America for bribery.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:14.960]   - Bribing bribery.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.520]   - Bribing publicly admitted to bribing politicians
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.600]   to pass legislation.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.360]   10,000 signatures so far.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.640]   - Well, I just gotta get campaign financing fixed
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.480]   in an election year.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.000]   10,000 glorious signatures.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.760]   - You only need 14,000 more by February 20th.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.640]   Folks, let's see if we can get to what to reach a goal
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.480]   of 20,000.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.960]   That's gonna change campaign financing in election year.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.440]   - All it says is to reach a goal.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.400]   - It doesn't say anything will happen.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.480]   - But this is about publicity.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.320]   I would love to get the people who would support
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.760]   the Chris Dodds of the world
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.000]   to explain to us the difference between this and bribery.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   - Oh, this isn't bribery.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.440]   Bribers when you get money to a Congressman.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.760]   - Well, looks. - And he does favors for you.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   - That's bribery.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   Since it's different.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   - Okay, so on.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.360]   - Since Leo and I once used the word extortion
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.600]   in discussing the operation of a group of lawyers
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.360]   in some part of the country and nearly--
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.560]   - I'm learning. - I'm spending a lot
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.480]   of equality time with lawyers
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   that would have cost us a lot of money.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   - I learned the-- - Let's step away
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.560]   from the bribery words. - Sifting as corporate councils
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   told me not to say that.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.200]   - Don't ever say that again.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.120]   But let's be blatant.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.720]   This is part of, I mean, the Supreme Court recently decided
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.080]   that, hey, corporations can spend as much money
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.000]   they want influencing elections if they do it in this way.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.760]   We watched Colbert and--
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.240]   (laughs)
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.080]   Sorry.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   I've still seen the whole--
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.400]   - Her and Kane.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.920]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.160]   By the way, how many votes did Colbert Kane get
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.440]   in the election on Saturday?
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.360]   Do we know?
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.600]   Would have been funny if they'd beaten somebody, you know,
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.280]   like, they came in third.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.640]   That would have been funny, didn't I guess,
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.480]   or we would have seen.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.240]   - Huntsman's gone. - Huntsman's gone.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.840]   So, this isn't bribery.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.360]   This is the way it works.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.440]   This is campaign contribution.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.280]   Hey, look.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.840]   - That is a threat of some sorts.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.680]   - Yeah, no, we're trying.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.000]   We're also, you know, this is the same thing we run into.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.840]   You know, AT&T and Verizon combined,
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.200]   spend $11 million. - But they never,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.840]   they never do this. - Lobbying.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.640]   I know, but they never go on TV and say,
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.920]   "Hey, we gave you good money."
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.800]   - The problem is the-- - And now you don't vote
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.720]   for us, what the hell?
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.960]   - The problem is, Chris Dodd is used to being
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.600]   a grandstanding senator that is relatively,
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.360]   can basically say anything he wants,
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.760]   who anybody he wants, with pretty much no repercussions,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.320]   and he's probably-- - He ain't a senator anymore, Mr. Dodd.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.280]   - He ain't a senator anymore.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.480]   He technically can't be a lobbyist,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.560]   but he is very publicly, he's doing stuff
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.000]   you don't do as a lobbyist.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.320]   - So he's still within the two year frame of--
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   - Last time, I checked.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.640]   - So he's not a lobbyist.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.000]   He just writes checks to members of Congress.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.360]   He's a SPA person. - He's a spokesperson.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.200]   - Or something. - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.560]   It's messy at best, it's ugly at worst, it's--
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.800]   - I think this is a-- - It's depressing.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.400]   - This is a wake-up call, and, you know,
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.480]   I think we all deserve a pat on the back.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.200]   I think the, what Wikipedia did, what Reddit did,
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.280]   it started with Reddit on Wednesday.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.880]   It showed Congress that we care, and they responded.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.360]   And I think we all deserve a pat on the back for standing up,
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.800]   but it's not done yet. - No, we've got ACTA,
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.000]   which is gonna be completely secret,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.440]   and it is what they call plural lateral.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.360]   I've never heard that before, but it's an agreement
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.080]   from all nations to do the same thing, basically.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.040]   - But Congress itself will take the various provisions
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.880]   of this, and they'll bury it in various things.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.120]   - Right, they ain't-- - They're not saying
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.600]   we screwed up, we're doing something that's bad.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.760]   They'll say we screwed up, we didn't hide this in a way
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.480]   that would raise any suspicious--
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.640]   - Well, they said, we'll come back and do it in a way
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.800]   that doesn't upset you.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.640]   (laughing)
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.040]   - But also, in other words, in secret.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.640]   But you look at, the people who are technically savvy,
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.560]   who are also savvy about the way life inside the belt way
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.320]   works, the Washington layer, like, look,
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.080]   this is a long game, and it's time for somebody
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.840]   other than the EFF, it's time for all of these companies,
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.720]   like, you know, if you sit down and take a look
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.080]   at the amount of money that Microsoft has,
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.320]   that Google has, that all of these huge organizations
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.800]   that are depending on the internet for their livelihood,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.480]   all they need to do is sit down and put down
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.640]   a little four-letter, you know, group that can sit inside
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.600]   and write campaign checks, and all of a sudden
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.560]   the internet has a legitimate voice in Congress,
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.960]   and the business model is preserved.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.560]   It's in Google's interest alone to legislate the hell
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.120]   out of this and start stomping on this.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.040]   - Well, and they do have a PAC, and Eric Schmitt's
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.000]   in Congress, but I think, you know, they're new to Congress.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.720]   They don't have the connections that a Chris Dodd has,
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.040]   and they probably don't have the ears
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.160]   of as many members of the Congress.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.360]   - The other thing is that there are other,
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.200]   this is a good issue for the internet
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.680]   to throw its weight around and get something,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.920]   get Congress to do something they didn't wanna do,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.160]   but this is an unusual event because it's bipartisan,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.360]   both the opposition and the proponents
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.440]   were on both sides of the aisle,
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.760]   and this is something that affected
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.920]   internet users directly.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.960]   I can't see something like this forming over some
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.640]   human rights issue somewhere or something, sadly.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.480]   Everybody's like, well, this is affects me,
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.760]   and therefore I'm outraged and so on.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.760]   And so this is a rare event.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.600]   - There's not gonna be able to download
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.920]   for mega upload if this goes through.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.000]   - And there was also companies on both sides.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.120]   There are some issues on which all the companies
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.200]   are on one side and the people who are not companies
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.960]   are on the other, and in those cases,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.360]   we can't rely on Microsoft writing checks or whatever.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.840]   What we need is campaign, I mean,
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.160]   I don't wanna make this a political show,
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.400]   but we need to illegalize this kind of--
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.600]   - Well, that's-- - Stop it, isn't bribery.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.280]   - That's what Larry Lessig decided,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.200]   instead of, you know, Larry's the former Stanford
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.360]   law professors now back at Harvard Law School,
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.120]   who created Creative Commons,
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.080]   has been very active in IP reform,
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.440]   and finally gave up.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.600]   And he said, you know, nothing's gonna get fixed
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.120]   until we have campaign, finance reform,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.440]   and that's what he's campaigning on.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.840]   So I don't, I think, yes, it's a political discussion,
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.880]   but it's where we have to go if we wanna change
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.400]   these things, we have to get that,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.000]   go down that rabbit hole.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.960]   Ed, do you haven't said anything yet?
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.800]   Any thoughts?
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.960]   You live in Albuquerque, it's different there, isn't it?
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.880]   - Santa Fe, to be more precise,
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.760]   and oh God, the politics of the Wild West here,
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.080]   you don't even wanna know.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.320]   (laughing)
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.080]   The campaign finance is a mess,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.840]   top to bottom in this country,
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.960]   and I despair that it will be fixed in our lifetime.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.720]   - Somebody's giving us this link,
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.240]   just if you wanna follow more on this rootstrikers.org,
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.160]   if you wanna find out more about what's going on,
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.080]   and apparently this is, is this Larry Lessig's group,
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.000]   or is this a group that he supports?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.880]   Anyway, there's a place you can go.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.520]   There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.480]   to one who is striking at the root,
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.560]   said Henry David Thoreau.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   So we've been hacking at the branches, let's hit the root.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.480]   What do you say?
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.880]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more,
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   great panel, Callie Lewis is here from LiveItLobsterGikbeat.tv.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.960]   Things are going good for you, Callie,
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.040]   you get now a network, you've got a lot of,
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.400]   you got like people.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.360]   - Yeah, LiveItLobster is our parent company,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.000]   and under that we do Gee, B, E, E, E,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   and Gee, Beat Live, just a little weekly show
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.760]   that's also broadcast on TV,

[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.200]   all of these subjects.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.800]   Do we have a score or is that a spoiler?
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   - Leo.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.400]   - That's a spoiler.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.000]   We devi-arded.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.840]   - That's a spoiler.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.080]   - I'm disappointed Leo.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.400]   - That's a thing, Sam.

[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.760]   Let's talk about squarespace.com,
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.800]   the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.280]   I, a lot of times people will ask me
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.920]   about what's the best web host
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.880]   or they'll say what content management system
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.680]   you recommend and I've got an easy answer
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.960]   for anybody who wants to create a website,
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.400]   not just a blog, but if you're a photographer,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.760]   you want to create a portfolio,
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.280]   if you're selling your products online,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.960]   if you're a hair salon, if you're a restaurant,
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.640]   anybody who needs a website
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.280]   but doesn't want to become a web guru to make it,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   this is a great choice.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.400]   Squarespace.com is hosting the best,
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.320]   I mean really the best hosting out there.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.920]   We run our a twit blog on it inside.twit.tv.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.760]   There it is right there and you cannot break it.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.640]   You cannot break it.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.560]   You cannot hit, everybody go there right now.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.400]   It doesn't matter.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.240]   You cannot break it.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.160]   It's wonderful, but oh look at that video.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.760]   Everybody should go watch the video of Tech News Today
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.880]   winning the IAW TV award for best news,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.960]   show, that's Josh Molina giving him the thing
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.360]   and it's so exciting and Tom Merritt.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.880]   That's not our show.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.920]   We didn't have monkeys.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.080]   So maybe that's it.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.040]   But Tom Merritt and I has Actar and Sarah,
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.920]   Lane and Jason, how I'll come into the stage
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.080]   and accepting the award, that's cool.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.640]   Anyway, that's on a Squarespace site.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.400]   So I could send you there, I don't have to worry about it.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.120]   Actually YouTube went down, but Squarespace is fine.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.680]   Also great software to help you design that site,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.600]   manage that site.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.280]   They've got templates that are unique
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.240]   by professional designers, but this is the important part.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.120]   You can customize them without knowing
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.560]   any CSS or HTML or JavaScript.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.880]   You just sliders point and click your way
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.240]   to a unique, beautiful site.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.200]   Now if you know CSS and JavaScript,
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.040]   the sky's the limit.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.360]   You can also customize there.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.560]   They've got an iPhone, iPad, an Android app
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.880]   so that you can post, moderate, check your stats,
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.840]   great stats by the way, best stats package out there.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.560]   Widgets for all the social networks
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.240]   make it very easy for you to include your Twitter feed,
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.200]   your Facebook feed, LinkedIn, Flickr, all of that.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.920]   Import and export from all the major blog APIs too.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.520]   So you can get your data in and out.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.280]   Very important, you never trapped there.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.680]   From moveable type wordpress, type pad or blogger.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.080]   It includes links, SEO images,
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.960]   everything's preserved, comments.

[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.760]   Oh, they're so cute.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   I didn't realize Tom was that short.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.840]   - Well, I think Jason is just that tall.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.240]   (laughing)
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.720]   I mean, look at how he is.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.560]   - Jason is huge.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.200]   - Yeah, stand here in the service apple box.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.640]   But great, great people deserve, very much deserve that.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.560]   Prize, I'm very proud of him.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.400]   All right, we continue on with some little things.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.120]   We've done the big things.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.800]   Jerry Yang leaves Yahoo.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.960]   That's, I guess that's kind of a big thing.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.800]   - It is for Jerry.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.480]   - The founder of Yahoo was kind of sad.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.880]   He's left the board of directors.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.280]   He's left all other positions.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.120]   - Wow.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.320]   - After 17 years, I mean, that's not to be.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.160]   - I would take the money and run.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.560]   - It's not expected, I suppose.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.040]   - Well, but remember when Terry Semmel left,
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.760]   Jerry said, I'm gonna run this company.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.520]   I'm gonna bring back the glory,
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.960]   the former glory that was Yahoo and he could not.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.800]   He just couldn't do it.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.160]   - Or maybe he thinks he did.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.640]   - No, no, I don't think so.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.040]   Is David Fylo still there?
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.560]   Is he gone too?
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.400]   - Fylo went off to do things with giant piles
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.360]   of money years ago, is my understanding.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.000]   - I mean, it was weird thinking about somebody who was,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.960]   like, yeah, it was, I think Cal and the guy,
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.000]   it's like 17 years, this guy's basically been in the trenches
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.560]   since pictures on web pages was this phenomenal thing.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.640]   - Right.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.080]   - So it's time.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.120]   They brought in this guy, Scott Thompson as CEO
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.600]   and took over from Jerry.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.680]   And I think the consensus is Scott is a merger
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.360]   and an acquisition type guy.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.920]   He's there to groom it for sale.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.240]   Maybe bits and pieces, maybe all of it.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.320]   So, you know, I just feel sure.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.600]   - The guy deserves a break.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.240]   - Yeah, but Yahoo, come on.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.880]   - Oh, does it make you sad?
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.560]   - Yeah, it makes me really sad.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.440]   I remember when it was acobono.stanford.edu,
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.280]   remember that?
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.720]   No, you're too young.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   - No, no, no, I'm just having flashbacks
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.320]   of gray pages and lots of text.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.080]   - Exactly, I wonder if it's, if I go to acobono,
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.360]   he was a sumo wrestler, right?
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.200]   And they were Stanford grad students,
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.680]   so they were still on the Stanford servers,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.520]   so they had a server called acobono.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.800]   No, it's not there anymore.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.000]   - One of the funny things about Yahoo in recent years
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.240]   is every time they cancel something or kill something,
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.680]   it's the first time you've heard of it.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.520]   And when they describe it, you're like, wow, that's awesome.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.360]   - Yeah.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.600]   - I wish I knew about that when it existed.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.440]   - Pikes, wow, yeah.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.680]   Wow, it's like, that's the problem, I guess,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.760]   is they had all these great things
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.600]   and they didn't know me knew.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.040]   - So is Google becoming like that
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.600]   with, every time they cancel something,
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.440]   are we looking at this stuff and saying, wow,
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.280]   that's pretty cool.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.880]   - I like Picnic.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   This was a website, standalone website
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.920]   that was purchased by Google, not that long ago.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.020]   - Yeah.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.440]   Photo editing site, they added it to Picasso Web
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.200]   so that you could take your images on Picasso.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.080]   Flickr was using Picnic for a long time.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.480]   - Yep, yep.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.600]   - And they're shuttering it.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.960]   They bought it less than two years ago.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.360]   - It's being Larry-fied.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.160]   - Larry is, I have to, now this I admire,
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.360]   this is maybe what Jerry should have done.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.920]   Larry is operating with a machete here
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.360]   and cutting out a bunch of stuff, Skymap.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.720]   I mean, I love Skymap.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   - But Google is doing some smart stuff.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.000]   - There's so many different things that they have to,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.040]   I mean, they can't just keep everything from house.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.880]   - They have to focus, right?
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.000]   - They do have to focus, but they also need
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.280]   to try new things and they need to experiment
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.360]   'cause they have the means to do so.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.440]   And they do build those features
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.760]   or those strong points into other things.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.560]   So it's not like it's totally going away,
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.680]   although, I mean, if you're a user of it,
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.120]   you're gonna feel it.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.080]   - That's the difference.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.560]   Yahoo just had these disparate products
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.160]   and then they would just buy them and then kill them.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.720]   Google has all these products,
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.880]   but they have a program of integrating everything.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.840]   So many of the features that exist within Picnic
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.360]   are being built into Google+,
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.880]   and the online photo editing capability of Google+,
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.400]   and they're doing that across the board.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.280]   It's not just wheeling. - So it's not gone.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.960]   - Cancellation, they are integrating features
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.440]   and discarding the features and products
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.480]   that are not useful.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.720]   - And they're posts on the official Google blog.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.800]   They said, "We're retiring the service in April 19th
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.520]   "so that the team can continue creating photo editing magic
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.520]   "across Google products."
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.800]   So plus, Mike, for instance, get a Picnic like.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.000]   - They will get some of the features of Picnic,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.280]   but you know, it's-- - If they can copy your creations
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.720]   to Google+, isn't that interesting?
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.640]   So it's, you know, and this is just,
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.720]   I think this is gonna continue.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   I think Steve Jobs once told Larry a page,
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.920]   "You ought to have five products."
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.680]   And they, I don't think they'll--
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   - They'll know about a thousand things, he said.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.320]   - But I think they'll cut them in half.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.160]   - Right.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.080]   Google message continuity, I don't even know what that is.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.360]   It's an email disaster recovery product
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.240]   for enterprise consumers.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.160]   - Well, that was actually a pretty big deal.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.560]   That allowed you, if you had a Microsoft Exchange system,
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.960]   you could back up your data using Google servers.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.960]   And this one, they're cutting because they want
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.480]   to migrate people to Google Apps.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.320]   - They don't want you to email--
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.000]   - Just exchange, why should I give you support for Exchange?
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.440]   Yeah. - Right, so they offered it
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.760]   for a while and now they're just ending it.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.120]   - No, Apps has been around longer.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.600]   It says they launched it in December 2010.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.400]   So it's only a couple of years old.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.640]   - No, it's only one year old.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.200]   Wow, so much for continuity.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.240]   - Wow, message discontinuity.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.200]   SkyMap, which is an amazing product,
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.440]   we use on Android phones, I think it's just fantastic.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.880]   Now here's a nice part, nice story, they're open sourcing it.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.040]   And they're gonna work with Carnegie Mellon
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   to make sure that SkyMap continues as student projects.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.600]   - Nice, I think that's the right thing to do with that.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.840]   Social Graph API, it sounds something like Facebook might do.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:09.000]   The API, I love this, you gotta respect Google.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.680]   The API isn't experiencing the kind of adoption we'd like
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.280]   and is being deprecated as of today.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.480]   (laughing)
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.440]   And then Urchin, which we don't really need,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.640]   but they bought that, folded it into analytics.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.080]   I used to use Urchin, but I don't use it anymore
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.840]   because I use analytics.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.680]   So I think probably this is the kind of thing
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.520]   Jerry Yang should have been doing all along.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.920]   - Yes, yep, right.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.640]   - Lesson learned.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.120]   - Right, and clearly Google doesn't want to set themselves
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.360]   into a position where in five years,
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   they're a mess like Yahoo with different brands everywhere
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.320]   and a bunch of unprofitable businesses
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.560]   and everything non-integrated.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.840]   So that is good management.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.160]   I said at the end of last year
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.560]   that Google should get rid of YouTube,
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.120]   spin it off, I know it's profitable,
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.640]   spin it off, get out of the content business,
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.760]   I wish they would do that.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.880]   That's more of a distraction than anything else.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.040]   Clearly they're not gonna do it
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.440]   'cause it's integrated now so tightly
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.160]   into the search plus your world.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.880]   - Well, I mean, I could see them canceling YouTube.com
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.040]   and saying it's all on Google+ now.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.200]   - Wow, the video.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.400]   - The Google+ is that important.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.720]   - Absolutely. - Absolutely.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.880]   - The whole search plus your world
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.160]   is entirely resting on the Google+ signals.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.200]   - To a large extent, I think Google's main product
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.440]   is going to be Google+.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.240]   They're gonna see almost everything
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.800]   as a Google+ feature.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.560]   - Wow. - Right, so Google+
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.520]   will be this Uber service you sign in
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.280]   and you are using everything.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.560]   - We talked last week a lot
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.840]   and if you didn't watch Twit last week with Danny Sullivan,
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.520]   we talked a lot about search plus your world
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.000]   and the conflict of interest it might present.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.360]   But it's very clear that Google,
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.000]   now what the strategy is,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.080]   Google+ is giving them all that social content
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.480]   that they aren't gonna get from Twitter.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.560]   I asked Matt Cutz on this week and Google this week,
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.720]   I confronted him, I said,
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.880]   this looks like you're promoting your service
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.600]   over these competing services
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.200]   and I don't think Google should be in that business
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.840]   as a search engine, it should be agnostic.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.560]   He said, well, you gotta understand,
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.080]   we would love to include Facebook, we did.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.160]   We would love to include her, we did Twitter, we did.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.440]   But you can't, as engineers,
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.760]   you don't wanna build on a platform
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.360]   that they could pull the rug out from on you.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.880]   You, Twitter did.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.240]   And we're reluctant to do the same thing,
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   so we developed our own thing,
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.920]   so the rug won't be pulled out from us.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.160]   Here's what people need to understand.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   I understand.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.080]   There's social networks including Google+
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.640]   are part of the invisible web by default.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.040]   They're not indexable, you can't just index Facebook
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.480]   and everything on it, including,
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.920]   you definitely can't index the permissions infrastructure.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.200]   And so it's part of the invisible web.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.640]   Everything that appears on any search engine
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.840]   that's part of the invisible web,
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.040]   including social networks,
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.880]   has to be part of the result of a business deal
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.880]   that has to be made in agreement between the two partners.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.240]   Now there's a problem with that.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.480]   For a while it was great,
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.400]   Google needed social signals, they were panicking
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   'cause of Facebook, so they made a deal with Twitter.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.640]   - They paid for the fire hose.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.040]   - Exactly, then Twitter came back and said,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.280]   we want double the fee and we want ad revenue
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.480]   and they wanna set a precedent.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.640]   - Oh, I hadn't heard this.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.520]   Is this research that you--
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.920]   - This is last, yeah, this is last summer.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.760]   - Interesting.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.480]   - And so, remember the real time search?
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.320]   - I remember it got pulled, but we didn't know why.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.480]   So they wanted to twice as much.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.440]   - They wanted to say, we want to, you to violate your thing
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.040]   about sharing ad revenue and we want double the money,
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.440]   we want $30 million a year.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.840]   And Google said, no thanks.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.680]   - Not gonna happen.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.160]   - And so now, now the Google+ exists
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.080]   and they have all these great search signals.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.920]   There's no incentive for Google to make a deal
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:29.960]   with Twitter or Facebook.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.800]   And by the way, it's not just Twitter and Facebook,
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.840]   they're 200, 300 significant social networks in the world
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.640]   and Google isn't making deals with any of them.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   And so really it's not gonna happen.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.280]   This Google+ integration into search
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.280]   is going to be the social thing for the most part
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.640]   and that's just how it's gonna be.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.920]   - It does put the screws to somebody like Lady Gaga
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.560]   who was not on Google+ last week
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.000]   and did join Google+ because if you're not on Google+,
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:56.880]   - And the White House.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.720]   - And the Google Google.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.880]   - You don't have those signals.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.720]   - Exactly.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.160]   - So that's why it's a conflict of interest in my opinion.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.560]   - Well, the thing is that we get back to what's a product,
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.480]   what's a feature is Google+ and search two products.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.280]   I mean, if you look at, people think Gmail's
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.360]   a separate product from Google+, is it?
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.320]   When you sign up for Facebook, you get messages.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.560]   Is that a separate product?
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.640]   No, it's a feature of the same product.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.480]   Why?
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.280]   Because it's integrated.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.640]   Now Google's integrating these services,
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.600]   making, taking products and turning them into features.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.120]   So it's a slippery slope and it's not absolutely
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.520]   not an antitrust issue.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.440]   That's gonna be tossed out.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.320]   - It's not not, not to the start-y book publishing.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.160]   - That's right.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:37.960]   And then all of a sudden it is.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.400]   No, they don't have enough of a dominant,
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.280]   65% of the market and shrinking is not a monopoly.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.360]   - It looks like a monopoly.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.680]   - It feels like a monopoly, but Google's lawyers
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.200]   will be able to demonstrate that it's not.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.640]   - Thank goodness for being, right?
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.080]   - If it weren't for being.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.720]   - That's right.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.680]   - Yeah, so it's, you know,
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.160]   - You know, they are being investigated,
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.560]   whether it's not a monopoly or not.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.120]   - Oh yeah, everybody's complaining about Google
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.040]   because they don't like it.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.120]   But I mean, Danny Sullivan had a great example.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.840]   - Mike, do you have a,
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.480]   I'm not trying to be rude here,
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.840]   but do you have a law degree or are you just,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.760]   is this just your personal opinion?
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.920]   - I've read all the opinions by the lawyers
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.680]   and the non-lawyers and I just,
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.800]   I mean, if somebody wants to make a case
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.920]   that 65% is a monopoly,
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.360]   that's, we can debate that,
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:29.360]   but 65% of a market isn't like Microsoft's 92%, for example.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.760]   - Okay, because the definition of monopoly power is not,
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.360]   monopoly power is not tied to percentages.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.520]   - And it's not just tied.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.960]   - You see, the VHA and the FTC are both have ongoing
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.760]   investigations as does the EU of Google.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760]   They wouldn't be doing that.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.880]   - They're investigating on behalf of complaints,
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.240]   but I mean, it's not, and it's not just market share.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.200]   It's also how hard is it to switch?
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:54.720]   Typing four letters means you switch to Bing.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.080]   And that's not exactly lock-in.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.840]   I mean, even Microsoft, the, you know,
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.440]   Microsoft argued that anybody can reformat
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.960]   a Windows machine and install Linux.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.040]   And that wasn't considered,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.920]   that was considered a significant thing.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.760]   And that's pretty legitimate that that's,
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.360]   a significant action for all the users.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.560]   - Not a Windows example of the parent like that.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.340]   - Right, but I mean typing,
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.560]   Bing.com is not exactly a difficult process to switch.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.240]   I just, I mean, yes, it's my opinion,
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.840]   and I'm not a lawyer, but it's my opinion
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.440]   that that is not an antitrust issue.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.720]   There's, it's just, to me, it's conceivable
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.200]   that they would look at Google search as a monopoly
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   that has lock-in.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.360]   - It's a pretty, it is a pretty fluid environment.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.480]   Although Bing's doing the same thing with Facebook.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.840]   They're, you know, they're massaging their search results,
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.560]   their native search results with social signals
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.400]   from Facebook.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.160]   - And that's yet another reason why Google
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.000]   is never going to make a deal with Facebook,
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.960]   because a hungrier and deeper pocket companies
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.080]   like Microsoft are willing to pay top dollar
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.240]   to integrate Facebook into their search results
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.240]   so that they have this exclusive content.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.400]   And Google's not gonna pay those prices.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.160]   They're already, you know,
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.000]   they already have an associate.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:05.840]   - Oh, they don't need you.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.000]   - Google+ strategy now looks a little clearer.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:09.880]   - Exactly.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.720]   - However, I think the shooting war,
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.600]   whether the DOJ decides to prosecute,
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.120]   it looks like Facebook, Apple,
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.200]   and everybody else is going after Google.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.800]   Facebook just made a bid for something.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.160]   We'll talk about that in just a second,
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.080]   but first I wanna talk about audible.com.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.920]   I am, as we all know, I don't have to tell you
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.360]   a fan of audio books.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.840]   I listen all the time.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.240]   It started when I had to commute two hours a day
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.680]   to screen savers, save my life.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.680]   I would have killed Patrick.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.640]   No, I wouldn't, but I would have killed myself probably
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.600]   'cause I just was horrible.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.160]   And yet, you know, I look back now on my audible account.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.640]   I have 500 books in my library.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.480]   That's a lot of reading.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.200]   - You probably read more books in your cards.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.120]   We did in college.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.480]   - Exactly.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.440]   You know, the truth is what happened with Audible
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.320]   is it brought reading back into my life
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.160]   'cause I didn't have time.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.400]   Nobody has time anymore to read.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.520]   But with Audible, those down times in your car,
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.320]   at the gym, and when you're doing housework,
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.680]   suddenly become alive with education,
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.400]   with fun, with entertainment,
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.360]   everything from Stephen King, the best science fiction,
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.720]   to great political stuff.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.080]   And we were talking about Larry Lessick,
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.520]   and I'm just looking at Audible.com,
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.720]   and his book, "Republic Lost, How Money Corrupts Congress
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.560]   in a Plan to Stop It" is now on Audible.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.880]   You can get this absolutely free
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.640]   or any of their 100,000 books free.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.080]   Here's what happens.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.000]   You get two books.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.240]   We're gonna go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.240]   That'll sign you up for the platinum account.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.280]   That's two credits.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.000]   So most books are single credit.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.520]   There's some books like "The Game of Thrones",
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.880]   I think is two credits.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.560]   So you get to decide how you wanna spend those credits.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.440]   You get two credits a month.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.840]   Your first month's free.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.080]   Your first two books are free.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.160]   You cancel at any time.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.120]   That's how it works.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.200]   So get Larry Lessig.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.520]   Did you read ReemD, the Neil Stevenson book?
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.440]   Did you like that?
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.680]   I didn't like it.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.160]   I'll say right up front.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.040]   I liked it a lot more than "Anathim".
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.360]   I loved "Anathim".
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.280]   "Anathim", I will never read "Anathim" again.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.120]   Oh, I will.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.800]   It was a punishing last 200 days.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.960]   (laughing)
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.200]   I read the new one in about three days.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.920]   Well, "Snow Crash", we all agree, great book.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.160]   "Cryptonomicon".
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.000]   Unbelievably fantastic book.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.040]   Maybe my favorite book of all time.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.040]   Get that one for free.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.160]   I mean, they have the entire Baroque cycle on here.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.320]   I mean, it's just an--
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.120]   I'm actually in the middle of rereading all of those.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.320]   The Baroque cycle's fantastic.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.640]   See, this is the beauty of it.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.040]   When it's on Audible, any book that you've ever got
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.840]   in your library, your entire library is available
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.680]   at any time.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.000]   Use the Audible app on Android or the iPhone
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   and you get your whole list of books
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.520]   and you can listen to any one of them.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.840]   These books are yours forever.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.560]   So get two books free forever at Audible.com.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.880]   Just finished the marriage plot, boy,
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:48.720]   is that a great book.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.280]   I love "Eugeneities".
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:55.520]   The new Stephen King, IQ 84 or 1Q 84.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.400]   The Steve Jobs book, there are plenty of things
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.240]   to choose from.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.400]   Go to Audible.com, browse around.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.400]   Once you've found two books you want,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.120]   New Orson's got card just came out.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.960]   Love his stuff.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.440]   Once you find two books you want,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.720]   sign up for the platinum account at Audible.com/twit2
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.320]   and those two books are yours free.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.920]   They play on almost everything, all the iPhones.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.440]   You know, they don't yet support Windows Phone 7,
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.120]   but I'm told March, a little birdie,
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.360]   not from Audible, but a little birdie told me March.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.880]   (laughing)
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.960]   That would be nice.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.880]   It's great on, but I have the Android app,
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.080]   I have the iPhone app, just fantastic.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.560]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them for their support.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.600]   Guess we lost Callie, is she dropping them?
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.200]   She went to go buy a book on Audible.com.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.200]   (laughing)
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.920]   She's like, wow, that's a great deal.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.560]   You know, I've been a subscriber since 2000.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.640]   I believe, really.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.120]   Yeah, love it.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:46.960]   It's incredible.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.360]   I did books on tape for a long time.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.400]   That was the company and you get a box of cassettes.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.640]   20, but you don't have a month.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.880]   I used to go to the library.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.720]   The library.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.640]   And check out the tapes.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.720]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.240]   It's weird to even imagine now,
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.080]   but yeah, it's awesome.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.160]   You guys are old.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.760]   (laughing)
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.440]   If I can share my little process
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.240]   for consuming audio content,
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.920]   I always have these,
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.680]   I have a short list of podcasts,
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.360]   including some of yours.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360]   I don't know if this, I should admit this or not,
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.160]   but I listen to everything at double speed.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.440]   Yep, a lot of people do.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.560]   Yeah, 'cause you're brain-
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.160]   You can do that with Audible too, yeah.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.640]   And whenever I run out of podcasts,
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.360]   which happens a couple of three times a week,
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.480]   I switch over to books.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.360]   Right.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.680]   And it's just a fantastic way to make sure
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.040]   I'm always up on the latest audio content.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.200]   And then I also get the sort of Evergreen.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.240]   You must have a commute.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.680]   I thought you worked at your jammies.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.160]   We exercise a lot.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.080]   We do a lot of long distance walking
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.880]   and running and stuff like that.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.720]   It's a lifesaver.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.600]   I mean, I like to exercise.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.440]   It feels good.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.840]   I feel good after it's boring.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.520]   And audio, having an audiobook or a podcast,
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.200]   it just says a lifesaver, I think.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.760]   Absolutely.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.600]   Got you back.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.440]   Thank you, Callie.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.280]   Thought we lost you.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.120]   So about that?
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.320]   You know, the internet, how it is.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:03.080]   Facebook and talks to replace YouTube as Vivo's host.
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:06.120]   This is a breaking story from Greg Sandoval on CNET.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:06.880]   That would be huge.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.960]   Vivo is the channel that YouTube created for music labels.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.880]   All the legitimate music stuff is on there.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:20.120]   If Facebook stole this away from YouTube, that'd be huge.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.760]   It'd also raise issues because, of course,
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.120]   one of the ways YouTube deals with copyright issues
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.760]   by pushing you to the legitimate videos over at Vivo.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.000]   Losing Vivo could be big.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.800]   Facebook, it says, Greg, is interested in a similar range
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.200]   but to the one Vivo now has with Google's YouTube.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.440]   Facebook would stream Vivo's music videos
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.920]   and the two companies would sell ads and share in the profits.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.080]   This makes a lot of sense.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.560]   They don't want-- they want to de-Googleify.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.040]   Well, they want to own all music.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   They've got Spotify.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.360]   They've got models.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.240]   They've got Google or Apple or--
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:52.960]   Everybody does.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.880]   At this point, it's such a giant battle.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.000]   How important-- now, you're big into music.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.240]   How important is social to you?
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.840]   You don't care what other people think.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:03.560]   Do you remember the thing about the old?
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.600]   You don't care.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.200]   You couldn't care less.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.760]   I use the online services for discovery.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.000]   But like, is that-- I still like to own the physical media
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:11.440]   for the music.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.560]   For people like me, if I know what--
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.120]   I'm interested in what you listen to
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.160]   because you have-- you're a musical maven.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.560]   So you are a taste setter, a trend setter.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.040]   And so I let-- no, I'm serious.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.400]   There are a few people that I know.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.840]   I'm not-- I'm not in hip to what the kids are listening to.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:29.920]   Not that you're a kid, but--
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.640]   But I was--
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.160]   Actually, Kelly, what are you listening to?
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.400]   I listen to people like Regina Spector.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.040]   Yeah, love her.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.400]   Colby Calle.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.080]   Those are my people.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.960]   So are you on-- do you spotify?
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.920]   Yes, I use Spotify.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.960]   I subscribe to the premium service--
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.160]   Me too.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.560]   --so that I can have--
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.000]   Now, here's the question.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:53.800]   Do you pipe--
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.080]   I should know this, actually, because I follow you on Facebook.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.480]   Do you pipe your Spotify listens into Facebook?
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:00.480]   You don't.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.120]   Why not?
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.320]   Because that's the-- how am I supposed
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.840]   to know what you're listening to?
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.880]   You can ask her.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.520]   I don't actually get the whole social music listening.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.680]   It doesn't work for me.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.560]   So I prefer to be a little bit more private.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.280]   I kind of like it.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.680]   So if I'm watching my little timeline here
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.120]   on the-- or whatever, the ticker on the right,
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.280]   and it says, my friend listened to this,
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.480]   and I'm interested in what you listen to, I might--
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.600]   now, some of this stuff is silly.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.040]   Like, I'm seeing Susie Slaminas' words
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.520]   that she plays in words with friends.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.240]   Like, that's meaningless to me, because I don't even
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.600]   see the game, right?
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.840]   But I see that Carmen listened to "I Need a Dala"--
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.720]   That's a great song.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.480]   --by Mike Chek.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.560]   So I can now-- I can listen to that, right?
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.400]   And watch it.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.080]   I might be more interested.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:56.640]   I've got one of the big issues in Facebook, for example.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.320]   I had my Facebook account before they had fan pages,
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.920]   and so I have a friend at everybody.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:01.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.600]   You've got to go back.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   You've got to make that change.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.440]   That doesn't work.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.680]   But I still don't think that I would go that route.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.760]   I like being private.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.960]   There's one person in my life that I
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   trust to give me music recommendations,
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.360]   and that's my sister.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.160]   And I will listen to other stuff.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.720]   But I don't also feel like I have a ton of time
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:22.720]   to explore that way.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.160]   I kind of prefer-- if I want to explore to use Pandora,
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.400]   who knows my interests already.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.200]   This, to me, I like better than Pandora,
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.720]   because Pandora seems like weird.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.400]   Something like the random features.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.080]   It seems like it plays the same stuff over and over.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.720]   I think there's a lot more interest.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.440]   You aren't thumbs-uping then, or thumbs-downing.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:41.720]   I need to--
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.520]   --thumbs-up more.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.360]   You need to-- you need--
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.920]   you have to participate in it.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.600]   OK.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.560]   I think there's a lot more interest in sharing.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.320]   This is an expression of who I am than there is in being
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.440]   shared with.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.520]   And I think that's why one of the reasons people like this
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.200]   on Facebook, because Facebook will make you believe that you're
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.960]   sharing your music with all your friends.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.720]   But they actually-- they spare your friends most of your friends.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.760]   They don't have to see it.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.040]   They're censoring left and right.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.440]   And everybody's happy because--
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.640]   I mean, they're not listening.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.280]   You mean?
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.680]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.560]   You know, it's funny because I left spot--
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.360]   New Year's Eve, I left spot--
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.720]   I did a search for Old Lang's Eye and found like 1,000 songs,
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.960]   started playing and forgot about it, and left--
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.120]   then it run.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.480]   And so on my Facebook, there literally--
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.960]   it was 1,000--
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.760]   I'm just like-- if I was ever on Facebook more than once a year,
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.120]   I would immediately be calling like 911 and sending
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.360]   somebody to your house.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.400]   Oh, I'm so depressed.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   Killing yourself.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.400]   Year is over.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.120]   There's 1,000 Old Lang's Eye and Marathon
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.080]   before he slits his wrist in the bathtub.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:49.440]   I mean--
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.640]   Well, now I realize that probably everybody who did follow me
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.280]   on Facebook has censored my music stream.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.040]   And I'm not talking to anybody anymore, obviously.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.680]   All acquaintance will be forgot.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.360]   Yeah, they forgot me.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360]   Unfriended.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.080]   Unfriended as fast as possible.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.080]   I like Kelly Sher-- we haven't mentioned that on the air.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.800]   But she's got Grover.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.760]   And what does it say on there?
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.160]   It says, I have--
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.920]   I have enough friends.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.240]   Confirm.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.240]   Ignore.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   You don't mean that, do you?
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.520]   I know.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.520]   No, I just think it's funny because it's very--
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.160]   Anti-social.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.600]   --of my Facebook life.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.760]   Right.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.240]   I saw a Valentine's card that says, not sent from my iPhone.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.440]   Not named by Apple.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.600]   All right, one last story, and then we'll wrap it up.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.680]   And it's kind of a sad one.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.640]   Kodak, the other shoe dropped.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.600]   It did file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.960]   We were hearing the rumors.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.080]   Kodak had said, if we can't sell these patents,
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.160]   we're just going to have to.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.640]   Now, Chapter 11 is not out of business.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.000]   It's a reorganization.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   Chapter 11 is either a rebirth or a flaming hole
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.760]   on the ground.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.600]   It's a little too early.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:58.880]   Well, no, I hate to be the fountain of joy here.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:01.640]   But basically, companies either come out of Chapter 11,
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.720]   or they disappear in Chapter 11.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.080]   But they have no real--
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:06.880]   Assets.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.520]   --business.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.840]   Oh, no, they got tons of assets.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.200]   They have intellectual property that they have patents.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.120]   Yeah, but if nobody buys it, well--
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.760]   They're basically going to turn it into a non-consuar company.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.640]   They don't have cameras.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.560]   They don't have film.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560]   I mean, those are dying industries.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.080]   And so really, they're in--
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.680]   everything must go phase right now.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.400]   And the patents are going to be the biggest thing.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.040]   Kodak says it has $5.1 billion in assets.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:38.720]   I'd take that.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.200]   Oh, and $6.75 billion in debt.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.480]   Including $12 million at Oz Nokia for intellectual property
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.640]   royalties.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.480]   Oh, well.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:58.360]   So if you go to Kodak, they did better than Polaroid,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.160]   as to be a company that had turned the digital corner
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:01.760]   pretty well.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.560]   They have cameras.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.920]   They bought a photo, so they have a photo sharing site.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.200]   I think associations in the minds of consumers
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.360]   are way more powerful than people think.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.800]   I mean, Kodak, you think film.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.920]   I think this is one of the reasons Microsoft
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.880]   is having trouble selling its pretty awesome phone,
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.120]   actually, because people don't think of Microsoft
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.040]   as a hot consumer electronics company.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.320]   And no matter how cool their phone is,
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.760]   there's an association with these companies,
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.040]   with what they did in the past.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.200]   And it's unfortunate Kodak could be a very innovative company,
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.760]   but people think of it as a film company.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.680]   They sell buggy whips.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.440]   Well, also, one of their executives
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.320]   said that we were kind of hooked.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.120]   Kodak's business was kind of hooked
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.760]   on the very high margin photo processing
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.720]   and printing business, which is gone.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.600]   I mean, sorry, but you go digital.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.000]   Nobody does photo processing anymore.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.080]   Well, it's crazy to me.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.600]   Look at this.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.080]   This is a company that made--
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.240]   I'm looking at an article in the Austin Statesman,
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.160]   but your company was making $676 million in 2007.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.720]   But it's incredible when you realize Kodak's global payroll
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:14.400]   is 1,800 people down from 145,300 in 1988.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.320]   And Justin in Rochester, which is a tenant upstate in New York,
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.680]   it's gone from 64,000 employees--
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.920]   or, excuse me, 60,000 employees in 1982 down to 7,000.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.240]   Jeez.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.040]   And look at the stock price, which is like 80 cents now.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.520]   Yeah, so that's sad.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.280]   Yep.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.000]   I think there are a lot of companies
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.400]   that are getting into new technologies
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.000]   and Microsoft getting into consumer electronics, things
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.600]   like that.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.360]   I think they have to work extremely hard,
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.160]   and they have to do things completely different
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.560]   in order to get consumers to change their minds
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.160]   about what the company is.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.080]   And we're seeing a lot of that across the board.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.160]   And only a couple are really doing it.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.440]   And I think that's the real thing that people have to do,
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:04.000]   is just figure out how to change people's minds, which, I guess,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.040]   is probably a longstanding business issue in general.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:11.360]   But it's going to be interesting to see who can actually do it.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.600]   And you cover Microsoft.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.080]   I mean, boy, if they were ever going to be a winner,
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.400]   this Nokia 900 phone, it's hardware is beautiful.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.760]   Windows Phone 7 looks great on it.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.520]   Is Mike right?
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.880]   Is the perception that Microsoft has been?
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.000]   Is that going to keep them from--
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.160]   I mean, they've got a product--
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.280]   I think it has a lot to do with it.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.920]   I mean, it is-- I love--
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.080]   Do you like the Windows Phone, Kelly?
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.600]   I love-- yeah, I do.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:40.480]   But I'm not carrying it around on a daily basis, either.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.680]   So it's--
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.160]   So here's the problem.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.600]   Microsoft had a string of failures in the mid-2000s.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.840]   Just Windows Vista was a big--
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.840]   failure.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.240]   Both technical problems with it, but much more important,
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.040]   was just from a point of view.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.200]   Hotmail, while it was originally an innovative product,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.160]   then became a mess.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.160]   And now it's, again, an innovative product.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.600]   So they have this-- the public mindset
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.360]   is Microsoft's a company that makes defective products.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.080]   The fact that they've been on a roll
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.080]   making very good products for the last two or three years,
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.240]   you have to overcome the public perception
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.600]   that the company can't get out of its own way.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.880]   And so maybe-- some people have suggested that Windows Phone
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:37.720]   should actually be called XPhone to capitalize on Xbox,
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.280]   which does have a positive reputation.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   I don't know.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.040]   But it's--
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.240]   Yeah, I think also that their reputation is--
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.080]   I think it's more that they're a corporate company now.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.680]   They're an enterprise company, rather than a consumer
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:53.680]   electronics company.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:56.280]   I mean, this is Apple's big advantage.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.360]   Apple could sell horseshoes and the fanboys--
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.840]   They're only triumpkin' up.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:03.760]   Or TVs.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.000]   Because they've really established themselves
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   as a very stylish, cool consumer electronics company.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.920]   I have to say, this Lumia 900 is absolutely worthy of Apple.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.440]   It's a gorgeous design.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440]   It's a spectacular phone.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.160]   And you know, but this is how you chip away
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:23.360]   at the perception if they can just stay at it, which, you know,
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.840]   to its credit, Microsoft is really good at hanging in there
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.920]   with things they believe in.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.840]   That's what they do.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.560]   That's what they do.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.520]   They're in it for the long run.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.520]   And if they can gain--
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:41.480]   if they gain to 1/2% of share a month for the next two years,
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.320]   they'd be at probably about 15% of the market, which, all of a sudden,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.080]   would be, now you're a player.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.360]   I saw a Windows Phone ad.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.840]   This is interesting on a Spanish language station.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.560]   I was watching soccer.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.720]   Well, and it was positioned as a cheap phone, the Lumia 710.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.880]   But as everything you would want in a smartphone,
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.120]   but only costing whatever it was, $50.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.800]   And so there's part of the market that they got to be very careful,
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.400]   because you don't want to be perceived as a low price leader.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:18.040]   But that's where the Nokia relationship comes in very handy.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.000]   Nokia has direct billing relationships with its customers
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.160]   in something like 79 countries around the world.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:32.280]   And so they can bring smartphones to the masses
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.280]   on these--
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.880]   in emerging markets.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.200]   And so you can get share that way.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.880]   It's not very profitable.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.760]   But you can get share that way.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.360]   In fact, that's kind of what Android has done in a way.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.400]   A lot of the phenomenal growth in Android share
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.680]   has been in emerging markets where people are buying very cheap
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:56.880]   phones that are running the Android, older versions of Android
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.880]   that are basically free.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.400]   Well, friends, I thank you so much for being here.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.600]   There's so much more we could talk about.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.640]   I hear football game has broken out, so--
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.160]   What?
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.680]   Well, we'll wrap this up just a trifle early.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.880]   Callie, thank you so much for being here.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:18.000]   Livid Lobster is the company Geekbeat.tv is the home to Callie's
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:18.920]   great show.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:19.880]   Everybody must watch.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.960]   Lots of good CES coverage this year.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.680]   And I presume that's all at Geekbeat.tv if we want to watch.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.360]   Yes?
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.000]   Absolutely.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.080]   And people commented in the chat room,
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.600]   if you're watching on video about my awesome headphones.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.440]   Yeah, what are those?
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:33.480]   Product placement.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.520]   That's my little logo.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.840]   I call him Dexter.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.560]   These are the V-Moda crossfades.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.600]   You have like official--
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.720]   I have the same cat-free girl.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.440]   --be headphones named after a serial killer.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:46.360]   V-Moda actually does custom plates you can put on their head
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:46.860]   buzzer.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.360]   Oh, actually.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.640]   It's actually shockingly good sounding.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.800]   I was really impressed.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   I think they are.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:54.080]   They're awesome sounding, and they fit very comfortable.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.480]   So where do we get them?
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.680]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.640]   It's V-Moda.com, I think.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:01.400]   But can I get the Geekbeat logo on there?
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.320]   I don't know.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.760]   Well, I'll make that happen.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.560]   Would you actually wear it, Leah?
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.920]   Sure.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.040]   It looks a little-- can I get it in something besides pink?
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:10.920]   This is red.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.920]   I'm sorry, OK.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.280]   You know, that was one thing.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.320]   And I think you and I need to have a headphone brand,
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:25.360]   because Fittyscent, Ludacris, Dre, we were sitting on stage.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.200]   And Sonomax came up with their new headphones,
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:31.200]   and it was Arabian Prince, who was apparently
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.520]   a famous person.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.760]   He was with the NWA.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.520]   I said, oh, you're the Arabian Prince.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.160]   I thought you were an Arabian Prince.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.400]   And so apparently this is the thing to do
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.960]   is have your own headphone brand.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:43.760]   So there you go.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.000]   Anyway, sorry, it went off on a tangent there.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.560]   You can wrap up now and go watch football.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.640]   So what Dre's are called Beats.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.320]   Yeah, well, Beats is a larger company.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.080]   It is audio consulting.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.920]   We could have the Beats off, or something like that.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.640]   Maybe you could have the best Beats.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:00.240]   Off Beats.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.280]   Earbuds dedicated to audiobook list thing.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.120]   There you go.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.120]   All right, thank you, Callie.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.120]   Great to see you.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.920]   He beat .tv.
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:14.280]   You got the little robot that rides its own bicycle
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.400]   on the front cover right now.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.040]   That was really cool.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:17.760]   And really wanted that.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.800]   So you don't have to?
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.760]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.840]   Mr. Patrick Norton, my good friend and buddy
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:28.400]   from the screensavers, hosts techzilla.com.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.240]   T-N-K-Z-I-L-L.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.600]   When you spell it with a K, you get the .com.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.320]   Get the .com.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.400]   And you can watch that and enjoy it.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.280]   And Veronica Belmont, your co-hosts.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.560]   You've wrapped HD Nation into it, too, right?
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.560]   So we get--
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:42.880]   Who may be?
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.160]   --a lovely Robert Herron.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.320]   Yeah, basically, yeah.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.120]   Two episodes a week.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.040]   The newly Sevelt.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:48.800]   Robert Herron.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.120]   Dude's lost some weight.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.280]   He's wasting away.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   No, no.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.360]   He's got a ways to go before--
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.520]   He's getting like Marine hard.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.040]   He's kind of starting to scare me.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.320]   He's lost 50 pounds.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.160]   He's running.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.080]   Also, Mike Elgin from ElginELGAN.com.
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:09.200]   And follow him on Google+, that's the best thing to do.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.160]   And you can also subscribe to the newsletter.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.240]   You might see him in Computer World and other--
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:13.760]   You might.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.440]   --hard copy publications.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.000]   You might.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.800]   Computer World still has paper.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:18.680]   Yeah, I think they do.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.640]   Yeah, I think they do.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.080]   You don't even know.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:20.480]   You don't even know.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.280]   Goudry said I have no item.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.080]   I just--
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.960]   PC Magazine's gone.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.080]   E-weeks gone.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.000]   They're all gone.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.080]   All those computer people, they have computers.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.600]   It used to be Windows sources, right, Ed?
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.040]   It was PC computing and before that PC world.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:39.960]   PC World.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.760]   All gone.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.760]   Mike was at Windows.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.680]   I was at Windows Magazine.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.560]   You were Windows Magazine.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.480]   I was gone.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.560]   I was Windows sources.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.040]   Windows sources gone.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.320]   So Computer World's like the last print magazine.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.320]   It's the only one you can--
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:52.960]   Allegedly.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.040]   And I have one PC.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:55.840]   The only magazine you can read in the can.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.120]   Oh, PC World is still in paper?
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.360]   PC World, maximum PC.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.640]   Yeah, then the imagine guys keep making print magazines.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.120]   Like there's somebody going to buy those.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.200]   Apparently, they're still buying them.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.120]   They're still in the newsstands.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:07.000]   They're still doing it.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:07.560]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.720]   You need something for the airport.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.000]   You can't read Playboy in an airplane, I found out.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:13.520]   I don't know.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.040]   It's just a rule.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.840]   Mr. Ed bot, thank you so much for being here on ZDNet
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.000]   or just go to his website, EdBot.com,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.520]   for links to all the stuff he does.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.120]   Great to see you.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:23.880]   Thank you.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.760]   All of you.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.800]   I know you're all 49ers fans.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.440]   So it was a great sacrifice that you made today.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.680]   No spoilers for you.
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.200]   I don't know.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.240]   I don't know what's happening.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.720]   I see right now it looks like a Kentucky fried chicken ad.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.280]   That's all I know.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.200]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.040]   We'll see you next time.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.120]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.600]   This is amazing.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:51.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:53.900]   (upbeat music)
