[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   This is to it. This weekend Tech, episode 50 for April 16th, 2006. Our semi-sentent.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   [Music]
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Our 50th Twitch. And I guess if you include some of the other ones, this is probably our almost our one-year anniversary.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I don't know if it's this week or next. But that's pretty exciting. Let me introduce the Twitch.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Of course, John C. de Vorak, who came in late on Twitter, I think on episode 20 or 25, but has become a stalwart in the intervening episodes.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We couldn't do it without you, John.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I came in to save the show.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You saved it. You saved it. And then of course you started Cranky Geeks and you're just going to pull a rug right out from under it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   But that's okay. I'm not going to hold any graduates.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   You are paranoid that you're not a good one.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   No, you know me. I'm just jealous. Roger Chang is also here who has been with us since the pilot episode.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Yeah, missed a few in between.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Yeah, well, you know, we can't all be on. I've missed a few too. We have a new Twitch with us.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   He's been on a couple of times before recorded, but we got brave and we decided we'd try Skyping across the pond on the line from Oxford, UK.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It is Will Harris, the editor in chief of BitDak, Bit-Tech.net. Hey, Will.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hey, how's it going? It is very late over here. So I hopefully won't be too boring.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Well, it's 11 at night.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, it's been a long day.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Has it?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Very much so. My router at home decided to die this afternoon.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And of course, it's Easter Sunday, so you can't go buy anything.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So I had to drive like a couple of hours to my girlfriend's parents' house.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Probably because of us, right? You wouldn't have needed a router if you weren't doing Twitch this afternoon.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Well, you know, I...
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So I apologize.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I can resist.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Now we should translate in Britain and Australia, they say "ruder".
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And that's a router.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Sorry, over here a router is what you do with like wood.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, it's funny because in Australia, rooting is what you do with wood as well, but it's a whole 'nother thing.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So...
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   (laughs)
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Only Roger got that one.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Hey, Roger.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I got it.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Turn your mic down a little bit, Roger, because you're a little hotter than the rest of them.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So I was explaining to the gang before... Oh, and by the way, we apologize.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Robert Herron was slated to be with us, and his mic was so noisy, we just kind of dumped him out.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   But you...
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Poor old Robert.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I felt bad, but it was nothing we could do.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   This show is going to be just a little bit short, I think, because there wasn't a whole lot of news.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Dvorak brought us the best news on his blog, Dvorak Dvorak/blog.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hey, beat me to the plug.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Dvorak Dvorak/spar.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah, all we want to word eventually.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's the subliminal version.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, Perron, I got some email from one of the writers at the alias, which is coming back on on Wednesday.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Finally, for us old alias fans, who apparently he listens to Twit, "Breen Frasier."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's one of the writers that he says that there.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He tried to slip in a reference to the Twit show into the...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You know, the way these writers like to do you slip in these casual references that are kind of inside gags.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Right.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And he got them all eliminated.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   He's got one left.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He's going to have...
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's going to be about somehow...
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And he's kind of challenging people to see if they can find it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm guessing it would be something like a...
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Like something on a screen shot.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Like if somebody's like, you know, looking at their computer and they'll be like maybe on the Twit homepage and then they'll switch it.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You know, something like that is, my guess.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Somebody in your blog said that they'd say another Twit is in the can or something like that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You know, it's always possible.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I think that's a stretch.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's hard to get it in.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And you said that originally he had written our names as the villains' names?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, we all...
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah, we all had a reference apparently.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then they all apparently saw Disney suit, you know, said this is nonsense and he pulled it off.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Why?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   They probably didn't even know who we were.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Why, he just didn't like the names, I guess.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I have no idea.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I can't kill a guy named Devorak that the...
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Actually, that's the end of the group.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Actually, that's...
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Who would be cool with that?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   The joke is that's exactly what the word was on the Devorak character.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   There's nobody named...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Like with a name like that.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   (Laughter)
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And Leo LePorak, that sounds gay.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You can't...
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You know, we'll offend the gay audience.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Well, you know, it's ABC.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's great.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Let's hope you get some...
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Can you get "Aleus" now downloaded from AOL?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I think that's the new thing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Everybody's making it possible to watch their shows.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Is "Aleus" one of the shows that'll be on night off?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, "Aleus" you can get on AOL.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But you can get the...
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Aren't they older episodes though?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Or are they current ones?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, those are old episodes.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But the worst thing is, is that "Aleus" needs to be watched in HD on a big screen
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and really get the benefits of the...
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The qualities...
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'm gonna say flat out.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I enjoyed the earlier seasons, but I'm late.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I mean...
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   John just loves Jennifer Garner.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   She looks good on the blog.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Let me tell you that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Well, that's a hot picture.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   What is she wearing?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It looks like their dress was porn.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No, or something.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But anyway...
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I agree with you, Roger.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The show is not what it...
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But they wouldn't allow it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   In fact, if you listen to this guy...
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Tell the story.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   There's a lot of...
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   They had some really good storylines that the executives...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They started focus grouping the show.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The next thing you know gets pretty...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Why do people do that?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Some of these focus...
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's like they pull people out of the four corners of where no one lives
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and then they decide, "Oh, I don't like that."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's like...
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Everything always gets wishy-washy.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   This is the problem.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Focus groups are killing this country.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Let me tell you, this is an interesting...
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Actually, I got a letter today about one of these.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But I have a general of motors executive wrote me once talking about...
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Or as an engineer and he told me that they designed a door knob for some new cars that was going to save the company like it was going to have as much to manufacture.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Easier to use, easier to install.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Everything was good about it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And they couldn't green light the thing because the focus groups hadn't approved it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   They can't do anything at general motors unless the focus groups approve it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's not just focus groups.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Is that why all GM cars tend to look the same and have this all suck?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah, it's not just focus groups.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It's designed by committee.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's writing by committee.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's having too many cooks in any...
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   One of the problems with GM is that they have to...
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   One of their preoccupations is to find how many of the parts they already make.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   They can recycle into a new model.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Instead of trying to flat out build from scratch, we could borrow this from...
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That makes sense, though.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But that makes sense.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's just economy.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But it's not the problem with a lot of software, though.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   That's too much of it is designed by committee.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   The team's on it.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's too big and you can't change anything without having to go through so many bits of approval.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And you just basically kill any kind of innovation that's going on.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think that's why a lot of the really cool products that people see always come from organizations...
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Or companies that no one's ever heard of.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yeah, isn't that the whole point of Web2?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Is it all these new teams that are producing the cool stuff?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   They're very small and they haven't got the bureaucracy and the rubbish to go through.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   They can just take it out there.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And if it works, it works.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Those layers of bureaucracy are one thing.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But also team size does make a difference with software.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   There's diminishing returns and it actually reverses out when you get the bigger and bigger groups together.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It takes longer and longer.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   They say that with Microsoft, it keeps wanting to change the way that it develops windows.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Also the story goes because there's so many teams now working on it that it just becomes such a nightmare to try and pull together.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   They should have a Windows Olympiad.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   No, they should do it competitively.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I think you're onto something.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You could say to two different teams, "Alright, you're going to do the new file system and whoever does the best job will get paid."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And the rest of you will get fired.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You know IBM used to be...
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That used to be the policy at IBM that you used to always put two parallel groups working on a project together.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It works.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The winner would get the...
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Well, yes, the winner would get the wrong one.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The real issue is how do you manage... how do you maintain innovation and personal control of the group when you get to be too big a company?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   How do you stay agile when you're as big as Microsoft?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Spin it off into a subsidiary.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You become a dinosaur. IBM is the king of this, aren't they?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Look what happened to them. They used to be dominant.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Yeah, well IBM, I don't even know if they're really a company anymore.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   They seem to be just sent for their chip business. They seem to have outsourced everything.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So here's an interesting story that came up. Well, here's an interesting story that came up in the news that changed the topic a little bit.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   There's AMD subpoenaed Microsoft in the antitrust case against Intel.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I thought it was personally thought it was quite amusing.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And the reason...
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Well, no, the reason I thought it was funny is because Microsoft's always kind of been in bed.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   This has got to come out in the court, but Microsoft's always been in bed with AMD.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You've said this before that that Gates owned AMD stock and Microsoft preferred AMD to Intel.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And remember they had that one product that one...
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   There was some Windows-only thing that AMD was making for them.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I forgot what I can't remember this was some years ago.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So these...
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You know, so you could ask a lot of fun by loading up your email with all kinds of negative stuff on the other company.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And you know, who's going to be able to disclose that?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It's like, "Hey, wait a minute. We never even had this meeting."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I think people don't realize what you just said is true.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I think people assume that it's Windows, Microsoft, and Intel are in bed together.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I think it's because it's been so long.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Well, everybody in the Valley knows for a fact that Microsoft and Intel have not gotten along for the longest time.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Oh, yeah, they hate it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So why don't you summarize what this lawsuit's about, John?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You seem to be following it most closely.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Yeah, essentially this is a antitrust...
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   This is a real whopper too.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   This is an antitrust case which is something of a...
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It may or may not actually result in large penalties against Intel, but...
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And it's about basically illegal practices or bad practices or monopolistic practices or something.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Well, they're asserting that Intel uses its monopoly to leverage.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Right, and of course everybody...
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Then they do.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Of course they do.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Or they did.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   We don't know what's going on now.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   It's very much the same charge that was brought against Microsoft, isn't it?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Right.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And it's also the same charge that was brought against Intel in Japan, wasn't it, where AMD actually came out trumps in that one?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's all part of the same case.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   But what it really amounts to me...
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I mean AMD is doing very well with this situation for publicity of nothing else.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But it says to me that this is really...
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   What I kind of think of it as is a make good, because Intel all those years was suing AMD to death.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Right.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Every time they turned around they were getting sued over something or other.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And it was a hassle.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And I think this is like, you know, here's your...
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Hey, back.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yep.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   So you think Microsoft will actually have a lot of anti-intel documents in this...
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Oh, I absolutely...
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   ...that will be discovered in this?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   There's no doubt in my mind.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I love it.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   A convenient meek or two.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   There's going to be stuff that's coming out of Microsoft that's going to be just...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It's going to be all over the news you watch.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   We may not have Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in the tech sector, but we do have AMD Intel in Microsoft.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Well, what's the current...
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   One of the things BitTech does is a lot of testing of hardware.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   What is the current status of the AMD Intel chips?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   For a while AMD was really kicking Intel's butt.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Is it still the case or have the new cores really improved in tests?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's mostly still the case, especially on the desktop in the notebook sector.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You probably can't buy anything better than the Intel Core Duo.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That's been true for a while, yeah.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   That's pretty quick.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Yeah, the new FX60 stuff.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   But interestingly, I don't know if you saw it, there was some testing on a Monantec this week of the new AMD platform, AMD 2, which is...
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   That's their dual core.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   No, it's like the next generation platform.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   AMD for the longest time has had...
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   The X2.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   The AMD's had dual core for a while.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Yeah, and it's also had its memory controller integrated onto the chip.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So if they want to move to DDR2, they've got to basically re-spin the whole platform.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So the AM2 is all about moving to DDR2, finally.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Is there going to still be X86 based or...?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   So this is kind of being the slightly disappointing thing, was that I think a lot of people expected big things from AM2 and expected some major performance increases from moving to DDR2 and a new socket.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And the testing on our Monantecs this week seems to suggest that there's not really going to be much of a performance increase at all.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So in fact, when it comes to doing anything to take on Intel in the next six months, Intel's got, you know, Conro and its new platform that looks very spangly.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   AMD looks like it might be kind of a bit slow.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Right now, if you were buying today, what would be the best consumer chip out there?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Are you buying anything by AMD?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So this FX2...
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   The X2 is sort of like the mainstream chip.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   The FX60s, if you've got like hundreds of bucks, just a smack down on a very, very fast chip.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That's what I'm sitting in front of right now.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It doesn't seem that much faster.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Oh, you're very lucky, man.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It doesn't seem that much faster, I'll be honest with you.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It seems faster to me.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I've got one of those myself.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Well, you have an SLI system set up.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yeah, and also two monitors and it's completely...
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And you don't think guys, we can get into O-salt.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   He plays solid terror.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   He's not playing half-life too.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   He's got Tetris up there.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   It's ridiculous waiting for WordStar.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   So do you have dual cards, John, or is it just SLI?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I mean, do you actually have...
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I have dual cards.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Oh, actually.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Now I have two systems actually with dual SLI's in them.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So does that make it quad SLI?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   No, no, I mean, I have another machine.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I don't just teasing him.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I'm low, yeah.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Good.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   So they're all in video cards?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Yeah, the good ones.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Is it really fast?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I think so.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I mean, it looks fast to me.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I mean, the thing is that, you know, there's a...
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   The entropy...
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I mean, these machines are new enough that I have...
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You know, there's an entropy issue still with wind...
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   All new Windows installs are fast.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   As soon as...
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah, they're all...
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   All the machines are fast when they're new.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I installed...
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I used Bootcamp last week to install Windows on my Mac.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Boy, is she seems fast.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   But that's because there's nothing else...
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You know, there's no crap on it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I'm putting things on.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Right, and there's no drivers that are working.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   No, actually, no.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   The Bootcamp drivers, they all work.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   No, no, I know.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   If you go to the device manager and start looking down the list,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   there's a bunch of things that it sees that it decides not to deal with.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Oh, really?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Oh, I haven't looked at that.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I should have known.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah, go look, there's a million yellow question marks.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It's the funniest thing you've ever seen.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   What was quite interesting that I saw a couple of weeks ago was that it was a laptop with Nvidia SLI in it.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Which had...
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I've heard about it.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   It's got a 19-inch screen.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Must have like five minutes battery life.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I mean, how long?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Yeah, it's pretty appalling.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And also, you really don't want to put it on your lap.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   No.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You go, yeah, you use it as a room heater.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It's probably one of those perfect LAN party machines.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Hey, look, I can hear you in the minute.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Well, it is.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   As long as you've only got to carry it to the car and back, then it's kind of doable.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   But if you're actually going to like carry it anywhere, anyway, of any existence, then you're probably going to do yourself some major spinal injuries.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   How long, John, before we're back to the compact computer-sized portable sandwich, let them those around?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I think we kind of still are.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Well, yeah, we did.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I think you were at that point for the game, guys.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Sure.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   There's a LAN party, guys.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They need to lug around something fairly big.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And they usually develop something that's pretty much like an old compact.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   In fact, it's going to take a shuttle case.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   That's what I've got.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   The shuttle goes in a little case, and then the LCD goes in a case.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Not that I go to--
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I've seen guys carry that around.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It's kind of--
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Not that anybody's in contact.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   --is a compact.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Nobody's invited me to LAN parties, but that's--
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I got the equivalent.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   What do you make of this?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Hey, everybody out there, it doesn't announce, but please invite Leo to a LAN party who'll be glad to go.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   No, I don't have to anymore because my entire life now is on Second Life.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   After I signed up last week now, man, people are giving me stuff.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You know, there's a lot of--
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   You're spending all your time with my friends.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   People are giving you stuff in the game.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   They're giving you things like money.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Yeah, money.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Giant hats.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Weird stuff.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Are you--
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Can you give me some--
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Can you give me some--
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Can you give me some--
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Well, you can profit from this?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Probably I could sell them.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Pruneface spatula, if you want to give me stuff.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   You know, though, I'm kind of shocked.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   There's a lot of sex in there.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   There's a lot of sex in Second Life.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You just do the thing that I've had.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I've had all the columns recently.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   There was some stuff on sleigh about it.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You can buy nude suits.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   You can actually--
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You can buy clothes.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   You can buy clothes, right?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You could buy clothes, but if you don't--
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   If you want to buy clothes that look like you're naked, you can.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And they're very graphic.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   They're very realistic.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Well, she's go naked.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   There is no naked.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   There's-- so this is how you go naked is you put on naked clothes.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   It's a little confusing.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So we talked about this on--
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   There's this--
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   There's Frankie Geeks last week by the way.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   There's prostitutes in there.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   There's prostitutes is what we talked about.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   What-- you know, this is Mitch Kapoor's company, you know.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   No, this is Mitch Kapoor?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   You're kidding.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   If you look into it, I think you're going to find these, like, the chairman or something.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   So for the uninitiated, Mitch Kapoor is--
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Lotus 123.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Mitch Kapoor is one of the guys who founded the electronic frontier foundation, and now
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I think we know why.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   But he made all his money off of Lotus.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And then took that money, founded the EFF, and now is using his newfound freedom to dress
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   naked.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   By the way--
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Yeah, that was just cool all the way.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I owe a retraction.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Who's squeaking something?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Is that you, John?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Is that your new thing?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   You have a little squeak toy in there?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Pretty soon he's going to have a bell.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He's going to have a buzzer.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's going to be like a wardrobe.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   We don't totally need a buzzer.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.960]   I have to apologize to the folks that are there because last week I said that they're
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   going to have to be a little bit more.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   I think that's a good thing.

[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   I think that's a good thing.

[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   It's just no good.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   I let my kids on my space because every kid needs a place to go where it's their own
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   place.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   You can spy on them.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   You can see the sprint launch this cell phone tracking service this week about using this
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   GPS triangulation for only $10 a month.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   You can know where your kid is at all the time as long as they've got their cell phone
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   on.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   I think that's a phone that would do that for my son from Verizon, same thing.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   You go on the website and you can see where they are.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.960]   We mentioned this Disney's doing it last week.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   This is clear.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   How old is your son, Leo?
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   He's 11.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   You need to sell him?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   You need to track him?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   Yeah, you know, where's he going to be going?
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   Is he hanging out at the bar?
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   No, but he goes into town.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   I don't know where he is.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   He goes into town on like...
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   He goes into what town?
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]   Sabastopol?
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960]   Petaluma.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   It's not a big town.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   Then he goes to the buy chickens I take it.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   He goes to the candy store and I have to keep an eye on him.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   Did you take a bus?
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   That candy is a killer.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   No, he doesn't.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   He can walk into town.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   No, I just think it's a good thing.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   All right, anyway.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   But I don't let him on my space and he's not technically supposed to be on my space.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.960]   That's probably part of the issue.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   You're supposed to be 13 or older to be on my space.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   And obviously there's a lot of kids saying they're 13.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   Well, that's now a bootable offense, isn't it?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   One of the new changes or change terms and conditions is that if you pretend to be older than you are or younger than you are, that's a kickable offense, although how anybody's going to know.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   What if you say you're 36 when you're at reality you're like 45?
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Is that a stuggen?
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   No, as long as you're...
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   That's probably dangerous.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   There's a lot of vulnerable 35-year-olds out there.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   As long as you're not working for the Department of Homeland Security, you can do that.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   That's okay.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   That's a little...
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   I think there's...
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   The eventually there's going to be some cases where a lot of this is just a goof, both by the kids and some of these...
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   I'm sure maybe that middle school teacher had some sort of issues, but a lot of people...
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   My son was...
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   When he was 14, he used to go online in these chat rooms and pretend he was 30 and he'd have all these women at Twitter.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   Right.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   They'd yuck it up afterwards and that'd be the end of it.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   I mean, he's not going to meet anybody.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   Have I told this...
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   I think they put on aspects.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.960]   I think the fantasy aspect is largely ignored in all this.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   A lot of people go on and pretend they're girls or women predict they're men and got football players.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   Absolutely.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   It's one of the reasons that any sex and second life makes me nervous because you don't really know...
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   I'm not that I would do this, by the way.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   Well, it's supposed to be sex verified in second life.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Oh, it is?
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   That's what they say.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   There are some services that will... some people that will absolutely verify that...
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   Because you don't know who you're getting in on with.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I think what's really missing from the sex verification is I said there has to be weight verification.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   (laughter)
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   Oh, she's fat.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   No, that's the beauty of it.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   I think really... I mean, look, I'm not going to use something like this, but if you are an unattractive person who has a hard time meeting people...
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   (laughter)
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   It really can become your second...
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   You put this more diplomatic...
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   It could become your second life, and I think that's not a bad thing.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   It could be a primary life because obviously the real world is just too hard to get along with.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   Right.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   When the real world spins you.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   All right.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   I don't know.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   I think it's rougher.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   I think that the online world is rougher than the real world.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   People aren't as rude in the real world as they are online.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   That's true.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   It's no big you are.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   The real world online is there.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   I am getting so... be honest with you, so sick of the lack of any kind of etiquette online.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   I mean, the kinds of nasty... even in our own chat rooms and message boards and our own comments on twit.tv, people are just rude.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   That's one of the reasons that I've made the Dvorak blog moderated from the beginning.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   People who criticized me for censoring.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   It's not censoring.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   It's trying to make the thing so it's pleasant.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   And I noticed that Robert Scobel last week announced that he has to do that now.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   Yeah, you have to.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   If you want to have... you know, it used to be... remember the well.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   I mean, the well used to be a great place.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   And I think it's mainly just because of... I mean, at that time, the type of people that could get on the well.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Exactly. It was very... but now everybody's online.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   And I don't think you can have that kind of intelligent online.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   The great little message.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   It's like any world now, isn't it?
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   I mean, the world is full of idiots.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   It's jerks.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   And so it's inevitable that they're going to end up online now that all the world is online.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   I have a firm belief that there's probably 70% of any given population on this planet I will never get along with.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   But wouldn't it be great if you could just moderate people in real life?
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   Like someone's talking to you thinking you're a bit of an idiot and you could just press the button and shut them up.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   I think you say... you say that, John, that's just Roger, but John, you seem like...
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   More of a business rope than anybody in this group.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   Do you like people?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   I kid.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   You're a kid.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   You're such a kidter.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   Do I like people?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   Yes.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   I love people.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   He loves his ducky.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   We know that much.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   I like people.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   Of course I like people.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   I'm a people person.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   I know you are, John.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   AOL ran into a buzz saw this week.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   As you know, there have been a lot of heat over AOL's plan to use this good email certification system.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   There's a whole petition online called deeraol.com where people are saying, "Don't use this.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   This is the beginning of paid email and it's going to limit access on the net."
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.800]   Well, apparently on Wednesday, America Online began blocking email that contained the address
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.360]   deeraol.com.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   CNET verified it, trying to send an email to the account and it bounced.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   It said...
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   I don't...
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   You don't think this...
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   No, I think it happened, but you know what to me, it's like who cares?
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.240]   Because the fact of the matter is they're obviously getting spammed, which is what it amounted
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   to.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.960]   And what new message have they heard from another 100,000 people saying that this idea sucks?
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.280]   I'm sure they have killed it.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.440]   I would do the same thing.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.960]   It makes their life easier.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.560]   Well, here's the question.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.160]   I kind of am with you.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.520]   First of all, it stopped after 24 hours.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.800]   I think it's very like it was an automatic filter, not...
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.280]   I can't imagine some executive at Time Warner saying, "We really got to stop these emails
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.360]   about the deeraol site."
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   I mean, that's...
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.360]   Really?
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   And you think they actually do it?
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   I do it.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   I think it's such a risky thing to do.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360]   But it'd be calm right away.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   I'd do it.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   You would?
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   Yeah, sure, why not?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.160]   Because there's no point in an email system where it can be censored.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   I mean, that's...
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.560]   You know, but your stuff is censored constantly.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.840]   I mean, spam is censored as you block IPs.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.560]   There's not an ISP in the world that doesn't have IPs blocked all over the place.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   That's true.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   I mean, the email that I...
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.360]   The idealism about email has been over for five years at least.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360]   So is email dead?
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.880]   No, it's not as a communication medium.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   It means it no...
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.360]   Well, certainly less useful.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.960]   No, it's not less useful.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.200]   I don't find it less useful.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.360]   Well, if you see less useful for spammers...
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.080]   I think it's less useful if you...
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   It's less useful if you're the margins of acceptability, perhaps.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   But wait a minute.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.120]   There's stuff that you could do before that you can't do now.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   If you're in that middle...
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.880]   Leo, you never answer your email anyway and you're complaining.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.720]   This is amazing to me.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.280]   Yeah, but I read it.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   I mean, it's not...
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   I'm not like...
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.320]   I think there's a difference in censorship and spam filtering.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Isn't there?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   No.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   No?
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   No?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.400]   No, well, there is because spam filtering is very much a kind of automatic process,
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   right?
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   And it's designed...
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.320]   It's like a machine and it just says...
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.280]   It's designed to get rid of stuff that's unsolicited commercial email, not stuff I
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.760]   don't feel comfortable with.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   You know, really it's just a point of view.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.400]   It's not a point of view.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.160]   It's a very clear demarcation.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.760]   It's just because it's politically uncomfortable for me.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.360]   It doesn't mean I want it to be censored, but if it's spam, if it's unsolicited commercial
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.720]   email, that's different.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   That's mass emails.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.040]   I mean, I think AOL could say that while there was a mass email coming in saying sign
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   up on dear AOL.com.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:25.200]   No, I'm saying as an executive in this situation, if I was making that decision, I would have
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.360]   some bogus announcement to make too.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.880]   I'd say, "Oh, well, the reason we expected is..."
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   You know, I would have called it.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.480]   I would have said, "Hey, look, you have to kill this.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.360]   You know, we're going to kill this whole..."
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.520]   Anything that comes in like this gets killed.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.040]   But what we're going to say publicly is that, "Well, blah, blah, blah, and you have some
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   phony, blown excuse."
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.920]   Yeah, they could have done that.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.800]   Do you know what their public excuse was?
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.120]   No, but I'm sure it was something similar to what I said.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.720]   No, it's goofier.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   It's goofier.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:56.960]   According to AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham, the original rose because of a software glitch.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   Always a good...
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   Always a good...
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   Oh, that's lame.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   It gets creative.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   It gets lamer.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   That quote...
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.880]   "affected dozens of web links and messages, including BOR AOL.com," but many others.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.440]   We discovered the issue early this morning in our Postmaster and Mail Operations team
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.240]   started working to identify this software glitch, and now that mail is getting through.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.040]   I'll show some backbone, buddy.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.320]   Presumably, the AOL stuff can get through now.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   That would have happened.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   See, I believe them, because I think it's too...
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   It would be too...
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.400]   Well, as it ended up being, it's politically difficult to do that kind of thing.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.640]   It's very dangerous.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640]   It's not worth it.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.080]   It cares if some people are sending emails saying, "Oh, you're well as a bad sign this
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   petition."
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   Who cares?
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.040]   I think that political danger is long since over.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.840]   I think you're living back in the '90s.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   There is no political danger?
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   I don't think so.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   Nobody cares.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.720]   The only people are talking about this are us.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   You got it.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   I'm the 300,000 listeners.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   I think you're right.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   I don't think I...
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   But on the same topic, did you see this story, "Republicans defeat net neutrality bill?"
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Yes, I did.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   By '93 margin.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   That looked pretty scary.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   Do we have any...
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   Was there one Democrat that voted or...
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   Why is the Republicans...
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.920]   Why are the Republicans getting blamed for this?
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.160]   Well, it's a Democratic amendment.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   That's why.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.520]   Yeah, it was the Republican that was the Republican that gets it.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.960]   So it was a proposal that would have levied extensive regulations on broadband providers
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.040]   to prevent them from offering these premium high-speed video services to their affiliates.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.160]   It's what we've been talking about before with this tiered internet.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   Verizon wants it.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.680]   A lot of companies want it.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.840]   If you paid or you're somehow paying money, you would have special access or you'd be
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.040]   able to get special services on there.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   It's the concubitancy.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.600]   The other side of what they're doing, which is bandwidth shaping, where they're turning
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.160]   off BitTorrent.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.800]   Unless you pay, you won't be able to get these kinds of video services.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.160]   What was even more interesting was that Amazon and eBay and Google and Microsoft, they all
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:59.520]   put in favor of the amendment saying net neutrality is a good thing.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.840]   It just went completely against that.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.560]   It was like, well, who are you guys anyway?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.160]   Well, that's because they're not putting as much money into the pot as Verizon.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.200]   They're not putting it into the right pot, I suppose.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.160]   We did a special tweet in the middle of the week interviewed Jake Fisher, who's the
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:20.200]   new executive director of IPAC, which is a new political action committee focused on,
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.720]   I love this idea, finding, targeting, and getting rid of these members of Congress who
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.160]   are not representing us well in terms of intellectual property, things like the Indus Act that
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.920]   Aaron Hatch tried to introduce, things like that.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.000]   In fact, Aaron Hatch is one of their targeted members.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.760]   Aaron Hatch is a target for a lot of these guys.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.360]   They'll never get rid of this guy.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.160]   He's so entrenched in Utah.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.360]   Five times they've tried and five times failed.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   You're right.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:51.240]   You know, if you're going to do one of these political action committees, you have to target
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:57.480]   weak people to get to the point where you can scare the stronger ones.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.080]   To target Aaron Hatch is like the first mistake that you can make.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.360]   You think he's indefatable?
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:11.320]   Unless you can catch him online and second live for a Myspace, you know, with some teenager.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.920]   It's nothing's going to happen.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   No, you may be right.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   I mean, that's the problem is that it's the local constituencies who elect these guys
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.920]   and they love them.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.880]   You have to know how to pick your fights and know who you can get away with or not.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.360]   This is fairly...
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   This is particularly a US issue will.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:34.320]   I mean, from the international point of view, do people look from the UK to what's going
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.960]   on in the US as a bellwether or is it just not relevant?
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:42.560]   Well, I think so because there's still a lot of feeling that the Americans control the
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   net to some degree.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.040]   And so what goes on over there has a sort of a ripple effect elsewhere.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.440]   To some degree, we've been kind of lucky.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.680]   I mean, you guys have seen a lot of lawsuits from the record industry over there.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.800]   That's not really something that we've seen repeated over here.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:03.960]   But I think there's definitely people in England perhaps take even more interest in American
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.120]   politics with regards to the net, maybe even more American than some Americans.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.800]   Well, it's also true that if the Consumer Electronics Association decides to put a broadcast flag
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.560]   in every digital device, that's going to impact everybody worldwide, not just in the United
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   States.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.160]   I think maybe the major issue is that we'll no longer be able to torrent 24 every week.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   And that will make things really difficult for us, Brits.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.880]   Say, you torrent 24 will torrent battle, Stargelactica.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880]   It all works out.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:36.440]   Although, did you see that Fox signed this week to make it shows available the day after
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   broadcast airing?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.040]   And they'll be free, right?
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Because they're going to put a first-person.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   And they'll be free.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.200]   But what I want to know is are they going to restrict it by, you know, geographical
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   IP?
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.960]   Because at the moment there is a major, you know.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.080]   I know a lot of people in the UK, there's like a little mini industry getting the latest
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.560]   episodes out before they air over here, you know.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   And if you're not available for free, they should just quit staggering releases for shows.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   It's rubbish.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   It's so bad.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.720]   And it's the same for films.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.200]   It's just completely stupid.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   It's a distribution cost.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.520]   That's the only reason that they do it that way.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.080]   They can't not, they can't, I mean, eventually this will go away with digital distribution,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.200]   but with hard distribution where you actually have to take a film physically and take it
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.000]   to a theater, they can't afford to make that many prints.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.040]   They would break the budget.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.360]   And then they can't let the DVD show up in France like months before the film actually
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   can get over there.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.440]   I mean, I'm a kind of sympathetic to this situation.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.160]   I agree that they should just let everything go all the same time, but they just can't
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.840]   physically do it, at least not with the technology that currently exists.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   But there's being technology-
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.840]   But you can't with television, you know.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   You can't.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   Oh, television is another story.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.600]   And some may mention movies and that's where the real world is.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.400]   But they do do the same thing with TV shows.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.400]   TV shows.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.280]   TV shows, there's no excuse for it.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   Well, in fact, I think amazingly enough a Fox executive or somebody at Fox has figured
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.360]   that out and said, "We're losing revenue here.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.640]   They're downloading it anyway.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.400]   Let's put out high quality.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.200]   We'll see how high quality, but let's put out high quality versions.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.520]   Same data will be HP.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.520]   You know what?
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.560]   They just need to be high quality enough for people to say, "Hey, I like to show enough.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.480]   Why don't I buy the box set on DVD?"
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   No, but you know what will happen as long as there is a-
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   Roger's right.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   By the way, Roger's right.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   No, because there's a commercial free HD version coming out the same day over torrent.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.880]   But wouldn't you just get that?
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.480]   No, not my wife.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.600]   Well, the enthusiasts are going to buy the box set anyway.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.160]   I think they'll sell more box sets.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.160]   That's all I can say.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.760]   Well, the more easy, the easier it is to get at the content, the more people will be interested
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.520]   the more that they will sell.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.760]   And I think for most people as you say, John, your wife is never going to go and start torrenting
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   stuff.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.560]   But if she can just go and grab it off fox.com or whatever, that's probably pretty simple
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.680]   and we'll get you hooked on a series that otherwise you might not be hooked on.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.120]   It's the same thing for IPTV.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   Going and grabbing a video podcast from iTunes is so simple.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.480]   You'll try out loads of stuff just to see what you like.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   It's saved the armpits.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:07.600]   But you might not spend weeks going through every corner of the BitTorrent underground
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.880]   to try and find stuff that you really fancy making this stuff accessible is as crucial
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.680]   as making it good.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.920]   One show I guarantee they're not downloading in the UK is the American version of the
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   office.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   Oh, no, no.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   See, that's actually got quite a good point.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   Are there parties that do comparisons?
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   It's a sick show.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   Is it good?
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   It's pretty good.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   Oh, I have to watch it.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   I just was a fan of the Ricky Gervais version.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   Oh, no.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.040]   You have to-- the problem with the office, I don't particularly like to show it, but
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.040]   I do watch it.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.400]   And the reason I don't like it is because it really starts to make you itch.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   It's a little too--
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.400]   Oh, it's too close to the thing.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   --crazy to watch.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.320]   I mean, you watch this and it's just like these people.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.520]   It's like watching an insane asylum.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.680]   That's close to being believable.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   Well, that was what was great about you.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.160]   But John, have you seen the English version?
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   That's so good.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   Yeah, I did.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.480]   The English version is even closer to the--
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   Oh, it's painful.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   It's--
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.320]   Well, you do remember that show that was done up in Canada called the newsroom or something
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.480]   like that where you had this evil guy?
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.000]   That was a great show.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.200]   They showed it on and off on PBS.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.560]   Yeah, it was a botch.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.400]   There's a lot of good stuff in Canada that we do not get here.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   Like call for help.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.200]   Well, yeah, call for help.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.240]   But we did give Michael J. Fox and Alex Trebek.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.640]   And let's not forget Anne Murray.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.440]   William Shatner, if you're going to bring up all of that.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   Yeah, yeah, Peter Chirren.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.480]   Peter Chirren's still going on Boston Legal.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:35.920]   This is starting to sound like an Adam Sandler routine in some twisted way.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.520]   Did you see this one?
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.000]   This is probably to me the hottest button story of the week.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.400]   AT&T Engineer says the NSA has been building secret rooms in AT&T facilities.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.320]   His engineer says, quote, "In 2002, when I was working at an AT&T office in San Francisco,
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.040]   the site manager told me to expect a visit from a national security agency agent who
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.080]   was to interview a management level technician for a special job.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.280]   On January 2003, I, along with others, toured the AT&T Central Office on Folsom.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   There, I saw a new room being built adjacent to the four ESS switch room where the public
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.240]   phones calls are routed.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.800]   The person whom the NSA interviewed for the secret job was the person working to install
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:28.200]   equipment, the NSA wiretapping American citizens with the help of AT&T.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.560]   Is this actually-- I mean, maybe this is just real UK ignorance.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.320]   But I always figured that the Americans monitored everything about everything anyway.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   Well, we always thought the--
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   This is kind of like--
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.160]   Isn't that what-- what was it?
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   Exodus?
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.840]   Exodus or not Carnaval?
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   Echelon.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   Echelon.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.480]   Yeah, your secret service is admitted that they use Echelon.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.240]   You know the way that supposedly they get around a lot of the legal issues about spying
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.920]   on their own citizens was, especially with Echelon, was they made a deal.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.200]   All right, so I'm not sure in the UK if it's illegal for the government or if there are
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.960]   a lot of issues with wiretapping citizens without their prior consent.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.840]   But the US basically went, all right, since we can't do our own citizens, why don't you
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.720]   look at our stuff and we'll look at your stuff.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.560]   And therefore, we're not technically looking at our citizens.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.560]   All right, and then we'll exchange the analysis.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.640]   Now this is the NSA in there.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.920]   According to this guy, he's a retired AT&T engineer.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.800]   He says, according to them, they installed a NARRUS STA6400 traffic analyzer into which
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.640]   all AT&T internet and phone traffic was routed.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.520]   He says he himself installed the splitter.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.160]   So I mean, this is a little scary if you ask me.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.200]   Now this isn't-- this is three years ago.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   They've been doing it for three years.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   What do you think, John?
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   Yeah, I can't imagine the stuff they've collected.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.080]   You know, I've always assumed that people are listening.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   I'm kind of like the British public.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.840]   I always assume that everyone in this country is listening in on everybody else.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:03.560]   And I just-- it's just a sad, sick situation, but there's the only way you can look at it.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.000]   I mean, I feel the same way, but boy, are we being fatalistic?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.080]   We're just kind of saying, yeah, I guess that's the way it is.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.240]   Well, I think we should be very realistic when there's stories like this floating around.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.720]   I mean, the story like this is like so above anything we have any control over.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.400]   And then it's not going to end.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.840]   I don't know what they've managed to get out of this.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.080]   I mean, it's a needle in a haystack still.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.200]   But the problem is, you know, there's so many laws in this country anyway, and the whole
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.720]   legal system's set up so they can just throw a million of a-- you know, whatever you--
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.760]   if you're arrested for something, they can pile on all kinds of things, and then they
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   make you bargain your way out of it so they don't even have to go to court.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.280]   I mean, the whole system is essentially designed very much like the Soviet system was where
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.760]   you could not really walk down the street without breaking the law somehow.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.360]   So if they felt like making you a target, you're in jail.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.400]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   That's scary.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   That's kind of the 1984 scenario.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   It is, isn't it?
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   Big Brother is clearly watching.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   You know, the first--
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.560]   It's kind of been known that, you know, you say the word like, you know, bomb or the telephone,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.280]   and somebody's going to be flagging it somewhere.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.000]   And that's just kind of like a gibber than I think over here.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.120]   You know, that Soviet system's always amused me because when I went to Moscow once some
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.000]   years ago, just before the fall of communism, it was exemplified at the airport because
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.680]   at the time it was illegal to take any rubles outside of the country.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.880]   It was just completely illegal.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.200]   And there was an embarkation line, which is a yellow line that was at the airport where
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   you were technically out of the country, and then you were technically in the country
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.200]   when you crossed the line.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.760]   All the carts that you moved your luggage on were all out of the country, and they all
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.040]   required a ruble or two to get them in a little machine.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.680]   But you had to even get into the country with one of these carts you had to break the law.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   That's outrageous.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   They got you.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.600]   Guys, I think we've possibly missed Google Calendar.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.640]   Oh, you haven't talked about it yet.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.680]   I played with it a little bit.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   What do you think?
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   Have you tried it well?
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.000]   I haven't tried with it a great deal.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   It just seemed like another--
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.320]   There's so many out there.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.000]   --on the online app.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   I mean, on the one hand, it was just like, well, Google Calendar, big deal with so many
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   online calendars out there.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.760]   On the other hand, it's like, well, once you've got calendar and email and I am an address
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.800]   book, you're starting to look a lot like Outlook.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.640]   I'm waiting for that integration, though.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   It's not there yet.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   I mean, we're starting--
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.120]   It should come though, won't it?
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   Well, will it?
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.800]   I mean, right now, it's just another calendar.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   It doesn't look any better or worse than anything else.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   It's got some Ajax.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.520]   It's got some artificial intelligence, so you can type, you know, make an appointment
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.680]   for Tuesday.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.920]   But I don't find it that useful.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.360]   Has anybody else-- I mean, I've got a calendar.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.360]   And I imported everything into it.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.120]   Well, Leo, you're a joiner.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   You would have done it immediately.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.000]   I join everything I can.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   You do.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.680]   And right now, I'm wearing my naked outfit.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.600]   I haven't played with it.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.680]   But we've mentioned Mitch Capore earlier.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.920]   What does this put him in this Chandler project?
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.440]   We haven't heard much of that lately, have we?
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   That's on his website.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   He's still talking about it.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.000]   But it's like, well, this thing, it seems to me that it's already so far passed over
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.480]   that I mean, these calendars.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   What's those-- I mean, calendars.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.680]   I mean, I've used the calendar.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.600]   I still use the Palm Desktop calendar.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   What do I need this-- what do these calendars do for?
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.800]   Well, because you're a loaner, John.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.160]   I mean, the advantage of these is group wear.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.000]   There's some of the few applications where it really does benefit being online because
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   other people can see it.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.800]   You can subscribe to other people's calendars.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   You can share appointments.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.440]   I mean, and when you have an invitation sent to you via Gmail, it can automatically calendar
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   it.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   I mean, there are reasons for it.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   But it's because you're all alone.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.180]   What's the name of the mass-- you always call the mass murderer.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.760]   You always use a loaner to capture himself.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.620]   He was a capture himself, that guy.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.620]   It's a quiet loaner.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.620]   It's just like a nice guy.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.200]   You never sit there and have anybody on his IM list.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   You know, it's--
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.000]   It's spindle some of my space.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.640]   My problem is it's no better than a desktop calendar.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.400]   I mean, it's like I-Cal, basically.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.860]   And I don't, you know, I don't-- like you, I'm a troubled loaner, John.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   So I don't see it.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:06.620]   The little loaner thing is the laziness thing about being in my situation.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.920]   Maybe you're the troubled loaner.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   Maybe I am.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.460]   But I think it's-- I get phone calls, say, hey, we got to have a lunch, blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460]   And I said, OK.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.060]   And I write down on an envelope, you know, because I'm down in the kitchen usually.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   And I write this thing down.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.060]   I figure I'm going to put it in the calendar.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.500]   And you ever do it.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.940]   And so I never use these calendars.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.980]   So I say everything's just a bunch of notes and little--
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   Just a little--
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   Just a little time of mass.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.980]   You're a mess.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.180]   You know, if I just don't take meetings.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.140]   I actually have a BlackBerry where I will email the appointment or the commitment or the
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.980]   to do to a central web server, which I can then get as an RSS feed, which will import
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.420]   it into my iCal.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.060]   So it is possible to automate this.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.900]   And since I'm doing that, it's been really--
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.140]   With a lot of very expensive equipment.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.340]   So that's talking about--
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.860]   That's quite a way just to get an appointment into calendar.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   It works.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.940]   I think the post-it note works just as well.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.980]   And I miss just as many appointments, so I don't know.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.820]   This is kind of to me a sad story.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:08.340]   It's somebody we know, John, Robin Raskin, who is kind of caught in not a very good situation.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:13.220]   We know a number of people actually who do these satellite media tours and VNRs, video
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   news releases.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.940]   I've never agreed to do them for this reason.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.060]   You don't do those, do you, John?
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.660]   No, I don't.
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.940]   I probably would if the price was right.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.940]   But I--
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.940]   You don't offer you enough.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.660]   I take a lot of money.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.940]   And Roger Chang keeps appearing on a Google ad, but not from his own design.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.980]   No, that just pisses me off.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.820]   Wait, can you explain that before we talk about Robin?
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.820]   You don't know about that?
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:41.820]   You've seen it.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.820]   No, I don't know about it.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.980]   It's actually-- you know, it's funny because I made a page as a private page for the Twits
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:52.380]   so that we can-- so when I invite somebody to be in Twit, they can go to the site and
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.140]   read all the details.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:48:00.660]   And if you go to that page, leoville.com/twit, right at the top of Google ad, tech TV recommends
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:05.260]   Roger Chang, quote, "I started using it two days ago and I can't stop using it."
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   They've been--
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.100]   So if I used like four, four, five years ago--
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   Five years ago.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.940]   --and I have stopped just everyone knows.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.700]   He stopped using it the day after the show.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.020]   The month, yeah, the month after that is like, I'm done.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.700]   You see more.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.620]   And anyway, the irony is if you put anybody's name-- I guess because Roger Chang's name's
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.060]   in there-- or something.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.060]   It just shows up.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.060]   So anyway, no, let me tell you a little bit about what happened to Robin and get your
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.060]   reaction.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:40.860]   So this is a video news release that she made for a company called DS Simon Productions.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:46.340]   The release was funded by-- and this is what happens with the VNRs-- a company will get--
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.500]   will put together what looks like a news story.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.700]   In this case, it was Panasonic, Namco, and Technosource.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:58.020]   And it was kind of a-- she builds herself as the internet mom and it was the best and
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.180]   worst high-tech gifts for children.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:07.140]   What were the worst high-tech gifts, the Apple iPod, and the Gizmanda?
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   Why?
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.260]   Because the people who paid for the video release have competing products.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.260]   What were the best?
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.500]   Well, it turns out three products made by the companies that paid for them-- the Oxy-ride
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.500]   battery.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.100]   You know, this is a shock that something would happen in this day and age.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.580]   Well, here's what's shocking.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.700]   I mean, Robin got well-paid to do it.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:26.700]   Do we know that?
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.500]   Does anyone ever-- did anyone-- I could find out.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   She did.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.980]   I guarantee you, these satellite media-- I mean, I've been offered these.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.980]   What do they offer you?
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.500]   Because no one's ever offers me anything.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.700]   Oh, it's thousands of dollars.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.700]   I can't remember.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   It's like $5,000 or $6,000.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.700]   Is it $5,000?
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.700]   It's between $5 and $10.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   It's good money.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.140]   You spend a day doing it.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.500]   But what really is appalling, of course, is all these local news stations that run these
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.300]   as if she's their reporter.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.660]   And without any comment about the fact that it's paid for by a company and that her recommendations
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.500]   are clearly slanted because of who's paying for.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.700]   I mean, you don't say the iPod is a bad choice for kids unless--
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.140]   Well, you know, there's an ethical issue here.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.020]   I mean, it seems to-- yeah, you're right.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:15.820]   The problem is that I can see somebody doing these things if they were just kind of-- if
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.300]   they had editorial control.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.300]   But you don't?
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.740]   Yeah, if you don't have editorial control and you're going to portray yourself as someone
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.260]   who does, then you've got a problem.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.260]   She does a lot of things.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.340]   And we know other people that do them.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.980]   She did one that was sponsored by Motorola, Nokia, Texas Instruments, and Swiffer.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:36.300]   I don't know how the Swiffer got in there.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.940]   So exactly all this stuff would actually show up on a news show.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.500]   Yeah, so you-- so these companies pay for you, right?
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.020]   And if it's that many companies, it's probably $10,000.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.260]   They pay for you.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.460]   You do what looks like a news piece with a reporter and it's plugging their products.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.980]   And then they send it to every television station in the country.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.500]   And a good number will run them.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.500]   Most of them without any--
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.420]   But what they actually did, which was an extra, was they say she did a satellite media
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.340]   tool, which basically involves sitting and doing like remote interviews with the station
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.340]   anchors.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   Becky Worley does this.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.340]   And so they run the news piece.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.340]   It's not the news piece.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.140]   And then the station anchor says, wow, that news piece was awesome.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   Right.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.900]   Let's get the direct, you know, report back from.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.900]   And so she did those as a little tour as well.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.900]   Yep.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.420]   And they spend the whole day and they do station after station after station.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.300]   I've been offered them a consistently turned them down because I do think it's unethical.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.380]   Well, Becky doesn't, but she doesn't do them as the computer mom or some sort of an editorial
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.380]   time.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.380]   She doesn't, as a spokesperson model.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.380]   Right.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.140]   And it's very clear, I think, when she does it, that it's being paid for by somebody.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.380]   So, you know, we know Robin.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.380]   I love Robin.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.780]   She's a wonderful person, but I think she's in, you know, this is not a good sign.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.060]   Well, these things are touchy.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.260]   If you have to do this, I mean, if you're going to do this stuff to supplement your income,
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.260]   it's pretty touchy.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.300]   I mean, I give a lot of public speeches and I do it for sometimes for large corporations.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.460]   And I, you know, I have to be careful that I'm not like pandering to these guys.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.460]   Here's--
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.660]   It bugs me because people think that people think I do it.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.660]   People think you do it.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.860]   They think that, well, everybody does it.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   It's another one of those.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   Well, everybody's doing it.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.860]   And we don't.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.500]   Well, isn't one of those things though?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.500]   No, we don't.
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.500]   Because I mean, one of the main reasons that we get, at least one of the things that people
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.460]   say to us when they read, like, "BitTech in the UK" is that they like it because they
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.460]   feel it's UK.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.260]   And there's some kind of like feeling that--
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.260]   It's only in America.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   English.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.260]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.460]   The American journalists are all like on the take and they're all doing these press things.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.460]   Yeah, you know, the Irish--
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.500]   The Irish journalists have somehow got this bastion of English.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.260]   The irony to that is just the--
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.260]   It's a bit false.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.260]   And it's true because the British, for example--
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.660]   Of course, I argue on the side of the British for this--
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:39.420]   By the way, when it comes to doing junkets, which is a pet peeve of mine, I have to like
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.420]   two things.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.780]   I think that companies should pay for journalists to go on junkets.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.100]   I don't think that the publisher should pay for it because it's--
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:51.300]   Why should my publisher pay to have me listen to some guy trying to brainwash me?
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.020]   I just think it's a complete--
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.220]   Wait, somebody, the British press and the European press in general, the publishers
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.420]   do not pay for these junkets.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:02.020]   If you go to China to listen to somebody lecture you, the company that is going to be lecturing
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.340]   you pays for this trip and you can take it or leave it.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.980]   Now you do a lot of these, John.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.980]   I do.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.980]   And I make a point of--
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.700]   Of course, people say, well, you know, you set your exception and all this other stuff
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.340]   because there are examples because we're not used to doing it right, where somebody gets
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:21.980]   paid to go to some trip, someplace in Japan, and they come back with all these fawning articles,
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.220]   whereas the Europeans who have always been had their stuff picked up for them by these
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.220]   companies.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.220]   And they come back and slam the guy.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:29.220]   They don't expect-- there's no expectation.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.220]   There's no--
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.220]   No, there's no expectation.
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.900]   But the Americans, you know, we've been set up to fail in this regard.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   Well, that's always--
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.300]   That's why I don't do them because you know me, John.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:43.100]   I'm such a suck-up that if somebody did pay my way, I would feel compelled to do that.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.700]   I like the fact that you understand yourself.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700]   But--
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.980]   Isn't this the same complaint that they level against automotive journalists?
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:51.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   Well, it's like, well, you got--
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.420]   Right, because they get to borrow a lot of cars and they feel obliged to say good things.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.460]   Or stereo reviewers are pretty typical of this.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:04.020]   And you have to read between the lines to actually read what the reviewer is trying to
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.020]   say.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.020]   You know, this is pretty common.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:11.060]   I mean, I think the English and the Europeans maybe are far more cynical people.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:17.260]   And so the kind of just laying the smack down comes far easier.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.500]   And also being far meaner about things maybe comes easier.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.500]   I mean, I agree with that.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.260]   I'm not expecting a very nice people.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.660]   No, I agree with that.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.860]   It's like, like, offending people.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.220]   But the problem with that is that's because they've been trained to be that way.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.140]   Americans have been trained to, like, you know, be objective.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.900]   And, you know, you're looking for all these kinds of ethical things.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.780]   And, you know, it can't just be mean.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.780]   I mean, it's almost like we're namby-pamby when it really comes down to it.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.540]   And so we end up with a situation where we have, you know, we have this-- something like
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.860]   this-- you know, even this Robin Raskin thing, I mean, it shouldn't-- if we were more cynical
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:56.420]   and we had a more European attitude about it, we would have, you know, but this wouldn't
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.940]   be a big deal because everyone would know it was like, you know, you--
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:04.020]   Yeah, but you don't want to have an entire press corps just brazed on cynicism.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.020]   I mean, that's--
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020]   Yeah, you do.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.020]   Yeah, welcome to England.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:12.780]   You just-- no, there's a difference between being skeptical and being a cynic.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.860]   Well, you just want to-- well, I think it should be in-- there's got to be a balance between
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.900]   skepticism and cynicism.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.020]   But I don't want good news.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.300]   I mean, I don't want the smiley news and all this--
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.740]   You want the news where people are dead or dying or people suffering.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.100]   You know, you know, where this is really epidemic is Canada, the nicest people in the
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.100]   world.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.260]   They don't want to say anything mean to anybody.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.700]   In fact, the line is if a Canadian bumps into you, he'll apologize.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.180]   Or if you get bumped into the bike, he'll apologize.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.180]   The line is-- I don't know what happens.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.180]   There we go.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.580]   Isn't that the joke that this used to say about the UK?
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.580]   Somebody's apologize to somebody.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:59.380]   Yeah, if you bump into somebody on the street in Toronto, he'll apologize to you for bumping
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.380]   into him.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:01.380]   I'm going to try that out.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.380]   No, it's true.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.380]   They do.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.380]   They're very polite.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.100]   What's the meanest-- who's the meanest country?
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.100]   I mean--
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.100]   I want to say England.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.580]   You think England's the Brits are the meanest?
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:16.020]   Well, I mean, I remember seeing an incident talking about a big tech company which had
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:21.220]   basically a press from a-- it was a field guide and it was pressed from around the
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.380]   world on how to deal with them.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.980]   And the entry into England was, you know, English people are all cynical.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.140]   They'll always look to twist your quotes and never give anything without prior approval
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.140]   from PR.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.980]   They will always fight for the underdog.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:36.540]   And it was basically just going through like insulting all these British journalists that
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.460]   were known to be extremely cynical and extremely hard-nosed.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.900]   And I think there's also the thing of them, you know, the Brits aren't afraid to press
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.820]   a point or to press a question.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   Right.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.540]   Where it might be awkward.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.060]   Partly because we know, you know, we're probably going to be flying home afterwards.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.020]   It's not going to be income.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.420]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   I really didn't know that about the Brits.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.500]   Although the British press is known to be especially the tabloids are known to be--
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.180]   Well, do you know, I mean, do you know, like, online websites like the Inquirer?
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.180]   Online is ruthless.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.180]   And gets it wrong.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.180]   And gets it wrong.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   And that's wrong for me.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.740]   By a fantastic cynical old English guy.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.740]   Yeah, you can tell.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:19.180]   Because he-- I mean, he knows his stuff, but also he is the hardest person maybe to be
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.180]   interviewed by an internet.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.180]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.180]   I bet.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.580]   Tevo won a big judgment on Thursday, $74 million, which pretty much saved the company.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:36.420]   They were being-- or they were suing Echo Star, the dish folks, for basically DVR technology,
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:41.820]   the ability to watch one show while you tape another, to pause, to rewind, you know, functionality
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.540]   there'd be no Tevo without.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.540]   And they won.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.460]   I have one of those units, by the way, I have the 928, which is a dish network clone.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.460]   Yeah, I liked the 928, but it's not as good as a Tevo.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.460]   Nothing's as good as a Tevo.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:54.460]   No, but it does have that 30-second jump.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.460]   No, and it's DVR.
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.460]   Say again?
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.460]   It has that 30-second jump.
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.460]   I should say, say again, Will.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:06.660]   I said, does this mean that Tevo now owns DVR as a concept?
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:07.660]   Yes.
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.140]   Unless-- unless dish success--
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.140]   How about righteous?
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.140]   --to dish will appeal.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.340]   And if they succeed in the appeal, then that might not.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.340]   But basically--
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.140]   It's not what media center does.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.620]   And all those other kind of problems.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.620]   That's right.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:24.540]   You would have to license basic DVR functionality, the multimedia time warping system.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:27.420]   You would have to license it if you're going to include it, which means everybody will
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   have to pay Tevo.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   It saves Tevo.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.140]   I mean, Tevo loses this.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.140]   They're gone.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.020]   The question that's unanswered in these stories is, where does replay TV fit into the scheme
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:37.020]   of things?
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.380]   They invented this stuff the same time.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.380]   That's a good question.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.940]   Why is it Tevo has a patent and not replay?
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.940]   I don't know.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.460]   I guess Tevo is faster off the mark.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.660]   Tevo's lost in its-- what, it's about six years of operation.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.180]   No more than that, nine years.
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.420]   They've lost $650 million.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:59.140]   And they only broke even in one quarter on a per share basis.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.620]   But now, I mean, it's not like the money's going to save them.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.220]   But the fact that they own the rights to the DVR is going to save them.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.220]   Maybe.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.780]   You know, it baffles me why that company couldn't make money.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.420]   They invented a category that everybody loves.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.900]   I mean, once you start using that stuff, you can't stop using it.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.700]   And it's like, I don't understand what happened that they couldn't make a turn of profit with
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.700]   it.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.700]   They had the thing cornered.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:24.700]   I don't get it.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.140]   Well, what's bizarre to me is they still have a corner.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.020]   I mean, you can use-- I mean, the 928's great, at least it records HD.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.620]   And I've got a Comcast box.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.620]   And they get the job done.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:37.860]   But nowhere near the ease of use, the functionality of a Tevo, it really is still the class act.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:43.980]   I mean, I guess people could say that for replay, but replay is kind of down and out.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.620]   Why hasn't Tevo been more successful?
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.100]   I don't know.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:51.980]   It's always a bad sign when a company survives because of a lawsuit.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.380]   And we'll be investing in it.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.940]   Well, they're still a buyout guy.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.260]   Those aren't M&A in the future for them.
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:03.260]   Their stock price went up, but I think it's still fairly depressed.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.260]   Speaking of price--
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.180]   But isn't Microsoft about-- sorry, go ahead and finish.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.300]   I was going to say, is it Microsoft about to kill this stuff with the next version of
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.300]   MediaSense?
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.500]   So they want to replace all your Tevos with this stuff into a cable card functionality.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.660]   Well, let me ask you--
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.020]   You don't think that'll happen, John?
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.740]   Which is worse, a blue screen of death?
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.660]   They can't get anything to work there.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.860]   I don't know what the problem is.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.860]   It's a hard thing to do.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.820]   I mean, I think the reason a Tevo works is an appliance.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.860]   It's not a computer, but it's an appliance.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.860]   It's dumb.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.860]   You can't be having a device.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.140]   It would be cool to have a wireless connection to my television set that--
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:42.920]   Hooked to the computer upstairs that has my terabyte drive from Mac Store sitting here,
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   grinding away.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   John, you can't.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.760]   All you have to do is buy a Mac mini and use front row.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.700]   iTunes, wireless, everywhere in the house.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.700]   But you can't use--
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.260]   But I'm saying we have-- I'm saying it would be cool, then they have-- then they-- like,
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.600]   you're watching TV, and then somehow, you click on a button and it records the show upstairs.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.780]   Oh, now that would be nice.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780]   Yes.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   Yeah, on the big giant TV.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.000]   That's-- frankly, it's the last piece of the puzzle that Apple has not put in.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.120]   I guarantee you before the end of the year they will put in.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   And then they will be a credible media center, I think.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   A little Mac mini with the RF check in the back.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.320]   All I need is a tuner.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   All I need is a tuner.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.680]   And already, they've got the ability to stream that video anywhere in the house, the audio,
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   the pictures.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   I mean, it's all built in.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.920]   They're just missing that one last component.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.600]   Of course, now they can't, right?
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.000]   Because-- or they can, but they have to pay Tevo.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   And much.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.920]   Yeah, it couldn't be that much.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   We all say that.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   It's more than five bucks that'd be shocked.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   Per unit.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   You could afford it.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.960]   That's kind of high, but it's $20 after all's said and done.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.400]   Got an antidote to the Forrester story last week that said that nobody-- basically nobody
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   was listening to podcasts.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:55.120]   According to Arbitron, which is the ratings company that rates radio, 27 million people
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.080]   will be listening to podcasts.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.160]   When do they say that'll happen?
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.160]   By soon.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   Any day.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.160]   Any day now.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.160]   Twenty--
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   And that's just in America.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.720]   Seventy-- seven percent of Americans say they expect to listen to AMF and radio as much
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.600]   as they do now, despite increasing advancements in technology.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.760]   However, a quarter expect to listen to last, less radio.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.400]   And for the people who have listened to podcasts, 27 percent expect to listen to less radio.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.520]   And among satellite radios, 36-- I don't know what to make of this.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.760]   Because Arbitron really is a shill for the radio industry.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   That's--
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.040]   So what they said probably was dead.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.880]   Probably downplaying the horror.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.600]   The horror, the horror, exactly.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.960]   It says 11 percent of all Americans have listened to podcasts.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.520]   That's the 27 million figure.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.440]   That means they've tried podcasts.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.000]   So I mean, this is based on, you know, actual statistical numbers as opposed to the Forester
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.120]   Report, which is based on Charlene Lee's opinion.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.360]   More than one in ten Americans have listened to an audio podcast.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.160]   Audio podcasting attracts an upper income audience.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.520]   I think that's good.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.720]   Not us, you know, we went to-- when we go to advertisers, our audience--
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.440]   the demographics are not as wealthy as we'd like because of so many students listening.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.160]   So if students, if you would mind listening but not telling anyone--
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.160]   Or getting second jokes.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.920]   Yeah, get a job.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.600]   Get a job.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.760]   Good job, money.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520]   Hey, you kids, get the work.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.600]   Get a job.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.040]   You're cost to us.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.440]   Get off my lawn.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.600]   Get off my lawn.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.600]   John and I are channeling each other now.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.720]   So Ed Felton, who is the great Princeton professor who's really been in the forefront
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.360]   in cracking copy protection, has begun a new series saying that HDCP, which is the
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.760]   copy protection system for high-def television, is bogus, is crackable, is terrible, and will
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.240]   be cracked easily and soon, soon.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   Wow.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240]   Easily.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   Look, it's too well.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   Yeah, of course it's-- what a shocker.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.560]   But now, he hasn't said how yet.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:03.040]   But he says, "Lessons from the Sony CD DRM episode is his paper."
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   And very interesting.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   Highly recommend it.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.040]   Can I tell you what I think?
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   What do you think?
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.120]   When a guy comes out with an announcement like this out of the blue, it's already been
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120]   cracked.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   He knows.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   He knows.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.880]   Well, it's one of those things that follows the Corey Doctor O'Rill, which is-- he coined
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.880]   back in a paper a while back, which is, once you provide someone--
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.320]   any DRM has to provide, not only the cryptography and the stuff you're encoding, but also the
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]   way to decode it.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.400]   Otherwise, your disk or your video is completely useless.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.080]   So once you give someone a box with all three of those elements in, it's only a matter of
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.960]   time before they pull them apart.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.920]   The only way to make DRM work is if one of the elements is abstracted and removed.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.400]   But of course, that makes your video then completely useless because you've got no way
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400]   to decrypt it.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.160]   And then, chapter six, section three, attacks on the back door.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.760]   I think you'll find--
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.480]   --which is different from what's going on in Second Life.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   I just want you to know.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   But I think you'll find--
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   Whoa!
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.480]   I think you'll find--
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.480]   I think you'll find--
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   I do.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   It's all.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   And then you're right, John, because Ed's a little cautious because he got in a little
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.560]   bit of trouble for revealing how to crack-- I can't remember what it was-- revealing
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.040]   how to crack another well-known copy protection scheme.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.520]   So he's probably very reluctant.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.520]   Star Force?
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.520]   Well, it will be safe to take a little while.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   It will be soft.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.520]   And they're taken away because it's so controversial.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Yeah, because they got hit for like $5 million lawsuit.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:37.560]   Is this the crappy copy protection that actually looks to see if you've got any alcohol
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.600]   120% on your hard drive, that kind of stuff.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   That drives me crazy.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.720]   Yeah, and it's supposed to be security flaws, allegedly.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.120]   Yeah, I think because it installs in Ring Zero that it literally--
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   Oh, yeah, I don't want anything in there.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.160]   Yeah, it was causing some issues with people's optical drives.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   They wouldn't work anymore until after you uninstalled the actual Star Force drivers
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   off your machine.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.600]   And then magically they would work again, but you can't play the game anymore.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.640]   There is-- and I don't know if it's Star Force, but there is a lot of manufacturers-- EA
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.240]   uses this, copy protection schemes that also check to see if you have any clone CD or
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.240]   alcohol 120%, any of these pirate piracy programs.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.520]   And they won't even run if you've got them installed, not that you're using them, not
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.000]   that you're using them against their game.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   They just won't-- you can't play the game because you have this other software.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   And that's appalling.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.600]   The fact that it would check my hard drive to see what I've got installed is just unacceptable.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.520]   Yeah, and again, it's just completely useless, isn't it?
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.560]   Because it's not like it's not going to get cracked.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:47.280]   So you're just annoying people, annoying average punters and doing nothing to actually
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   combat piracy.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.880]   My point always-- in fact, it just teaches people how to do it.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.720]   Okay, let's everybody figure out how to do it.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.160]   It encourages normal people to go out and become pirates.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.000]   They're all turning into Ed Felton's.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.360]   Blizzard has banned 5,400 accounts in World of Warcraft to spend $10,700 more for using-- things
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:11.520]   like using third party programs to farm gold and so-called cheating.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520]   And then in a related story--
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520]   They've got me.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.360]   --10,700 people have all started dressing naked in Second Life.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360]   So there you go.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360]   Dada.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.360]   Are you a World of Warcraft fan, Will?
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.920]   You said you wish they banned you?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   You're hooked, aren't you?
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.400]   Well, isn't everybody?
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   No, I erased it.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.640]   It's hard to-- I had to erase you, Leo.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   I had to.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   You got to go cold turkey.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   I had to.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   I erased it so I couldn't play it.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.200]   And it takes so long to install, right?
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.640]   Well, once you install it, you have to go through this round of endless rounds of--
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   Oh, man.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   You should try installing it on the Mac.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   Oh, go to the Power Book with it.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   It goes on.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   It goes on.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   On and on.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   It takes like about three hours.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   It's a DVD just to install it.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.040]   And then you-- oh, finally, I can run this.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   And it says, no, hold on.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   I have to upgrade myself.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.240]   And it does it like four or five times.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   The pain.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   The horror.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   The horror.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   The horror.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   No, get into Second Life.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.280]   You'll find it much more interesting.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   I'm Pruneface Spatula.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   Isn't Second Life like-- don't you have to be like 40 before you can even join that one?
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   I think you should.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.120]   I think you should have to be an adult.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.280]   I think it's supposed to be like for old parts.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.280]   For mature adults.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.360]   No, I am Nevdul in there.com.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.680]   And I am Pruneface Spatula in Second Life.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.880]   And now that I've-- this is my 12-step program.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.120]   Now that I've told people my name, I can never go in there again.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   Nevdul?
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   Nevdul.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120]   Yeah, because somebody had--
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   Devdul.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   Nevdul.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   Get it?
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   Nevdul?
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   Yeah, get it?
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   Yeah, that's hilarious.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   Play on words.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.480]   Well, it doesn't matter because I can never use it again now because as soon as I go in,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   I'll be bummed by.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.320]   You can use it today because the podcast doesn't go out till tomorrow.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   My last chance.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.760]   I'm going to quickly run in there right now.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   So that's it.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   Keep it on your naked suit.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.560]   Another 20's in the can.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   Bye.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.200]   Is there any-- oh, one other thing I want to say, the videotape recorder turned 50 on
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200]   Friday.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200]   Woo-hoo.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.000]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   Yeah, you can thank Devdul for that.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Did he really die?
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.400]   Ray Dolby doesn't get the credit for that, but he's the inventor.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   Really?
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   Did he invent it?
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   Was he?
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   Wasn't it an Ampex?
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   Yeah, that's where he was.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.400]   He was the head honcho.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.960]   To this day, I understand from people that know him well that he's still irked by the
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:21.240]   fact that nobody gives him credit for being the real guy who did the videotape recorder.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.560]   You're absolutely right because I'm reading an article here in tvtechnology.com.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.160]   Does it mention his name?
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.160]   No.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.760]   It's got a picture of the-- you know, it's kind of a neat story.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.360]   It was a pre-NAB meeting.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.280]   A couple hundred people in the room assembled for pretty much a routine Ampex briefing.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.360]   They just do the briefing and then, without a word, at the end of the briefing ends, they
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.400]   open a curtain and the briefing starts up again because they were taping it.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.240]   And people are like, "Whoa, what?
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   Huh?
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   He's back.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.840]   How did he do that?"
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   I mean, it's actually a very clever--
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.760]   Is that really a-- isn't that a bit of a misnomer because it didn't tape Dolly a couple
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   of years ago?
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.320]   So can it really have like a 50th birthday?
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320]   No, no, no.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.320]   They still use feet-- these tape and broadcasted, you sure?
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   Roger knows.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   These DVC pros tape.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   I mean, these tapes.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   Yes, these tapes.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.800]   It's all stems from the early Dolby stuff.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.040]   I mean, he was the only guy, of course, but he's the-- everybody gives him credit for
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.040]   being really the smartest guy in the room.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.400]   And you know, to this day, you know, except for this show, ladies and gentlemen, the two
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   with broadcast, you will now-- nobody gives the guy credit but us.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   That's right.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400]   That's right.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.120]   So he actually came up with the Helix kind of concept to--
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.680]   Anyway, we're talking about the big four headed two-inch RCA monsters that used to dominate
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680]   your--
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   Oh, those things are gigantic, yeah.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Half-inch tape.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   Done out of Japan.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   Came out of Japan.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.200]   Actually, I want to take this back.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.520]   They do give Dolby credit.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.720]   They mention the Ampex team.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.040]   Charles Ginsburg was the leader.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.680]   Charles Anderson was an FM expert.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.440]   Ray Dolby, then an engineering student, later a household name in the audio field.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.800]   Charles B Henderson was the machinist.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.760]   Alex Mackie, the mechanical genius behind the rotary head.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   That's actually a brilliant--
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   Yeah, that's the best.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.360]   The rotary head is brilliant.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.760]   And Fred Fost, who saw the problem.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   It's a good team.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   It's a good team.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   It's a good team.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.200]   Well, speaking of good teams, it's been a great show.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.600]   I want to thank you, Will, for visiting us from over the pond.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.720]   It's amazing how well Skype works that we could-- you sound like you're right next
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   door.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.120]   Well, I would love to be right next door in sunny California right now.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   Is it--
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.680]   We've had nothing but rain in the Bay Area for the last 40 days and 40 nights.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   It's unbelievable.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]   But keep imagining it.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.160]   Just keep imagining it's sunny.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.160]   Maybe it will get sunny.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.160]   Well, I hope it gets better for E3.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.880]   Are you coming out free three?
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   All right.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   I'm looking forward to it.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   There's going to be some good stuff.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   Roger, last E3 was a nightmare for you.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.200]   You're not going back down, are you?
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.520]   Not that I've heard.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.360]   You'll never go there again.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.800]   I remember last year's E3.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800]   You were just dying.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.560]   I was like, never again.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560]   Ever again.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.920]   Are we going to do a 23?
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920]   I think we should.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920]   I'd like to.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.240]   If I did junkets, I could.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.680]   NVIDIA invited me to a junket to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel for a presentation down
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680]   there.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.520]   Oh, I've done-- I've done pachunkets before.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   NVIDIA invited you to--
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   Makes you feel dirty.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   --for what?
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   It wasn't NVIDIA.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   It was Viya, VIA.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.920]   Did you get invited to that?
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   No.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.120]   Viya's invited me to a lot of different things over the years.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.400]   I've never taken them up on any of them because their system is like-- oh, I don't want
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   to go into it.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.280]   It's more trouble than it's worth.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   Let's put it that way.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.280]   They should-- maybe they were offering free airfare in a hotel.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280]   You can't--
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.280]   What, say in LA, isn't it?
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   You can walk down there.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   You can be free airfare.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.840]   You know, I want to get one of these junkets.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   I won't--
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.640]   You go to Japan to have Toshiba take you there.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.640]   I won't be too nice.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   I won't be too nice.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.680]   You'll be cynical.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.480]   All right, thanks to stupid.com for the sound effects on today's show.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480]   So is that-- what is that?
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   A little squeak toy, John.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480]   What is that?
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.640]   It's actually the inside of a toy.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.040]   My daughter was obsessed about me busting open so she can steal this thing.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:09.960]   It was a little-- it was a strange toy that was from Sesame Street where that big bird
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   walks around and he makes this noise.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.600]   So it's a broken big bird?
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.600]   Well, it's actually just the--
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600]   Can we get those on the twit store?
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   Yeah, we're going to-- that'll be it.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.600]   That'll be great.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.280]   All right, a little to four Rux squeakers.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.640]   The twit store is now going down in history along with Duke Nukem Forever and Patrick's
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.320]   Box of crap as the never will happen.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   The never will happen.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.600]   We could be making so much money.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.200]   John, tell me about it.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.000]   Pretty orders.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.560]   Well, yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.840]   I've got an idea for-- we'll talk about it offline.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:44.680]   All right, because I signed up in November with these companies and nothing's happened.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.480]   So I don't know.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   We'll go to another provider.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480]   Nobody wants to do it.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.600]   I called ThinkGeek and we have great contacts over there and they said, yeah, yeah, and
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.240]   then nothing either from there.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.200]   Yeah, I think they're middlemen themselves.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.200]   Maybe that's it.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.200]   Maybe that's it.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.640]   Got to go to China.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   That's it.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.200]   Roger, can you help us with the importing?
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.280]   You speak the language?
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   Actually, I probably--
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.280]   Oh, look, it's--
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.400]   I speak more Chinese than you.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   I'm almost positive.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Oh, probably.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   I studied it.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   Did you know I knew?
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.560]   Yeah, they all speak good Chinese.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.120]   I speak good Chinese, but lousy English.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.080]   I want to thank the folks at AOL Radio for providing us with a bandwidth for this podcast
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.440]   at AOL.com/podcasting.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.360]   They're our great partners.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.720]   We are talking with other people and partnering with us and I think that in time we actually
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.160]   may have a store or something anyway.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.480]   But until then, please help us by just clicking those buttons.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.960]   $2 a month is all we ask.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:43.640]   It helps us keep the show on the air pays for equipment and keeps Roger Chang and Tang.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.480]   And I just said that because it rhymed.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.760]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   This week in Tack-Tack-Tack.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:15:17.200]   [Music]
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.160]   This one can get an attack.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.160]   [Music]
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   [Music]
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.160]   So anyway,
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.160]   that was good one. That was fun. Yeah, that was cool.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.160]   You knew it was going to go longer than you thought. Huh? It was. We got actually, there were some good stories in there.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   Yeah, there were some good ones. Yeah, we thought we had nothing, but it was good. You never know.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   I'm so glad you could join us. You were a great addition to it. Yeah, I like the accent, that phony accent you got great.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   He's really in, he's really in passing. Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, John.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.160]   Ooh, that's good. There you go. See, he was all a fake.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:11.520]   He's really in the, in the, in the phone room in AT&T, San Francisco, working for the
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:21.520]   [Music]
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.520]   You can go, you can donate, um, Linden Lab dollars. Oh, that's neat.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.520]   Linden's to creative comments, and then they can change their real world.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.520]   This is, this is, this is giving, this now becomes, in my opinion, for me,
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.520]   anyway, it becomes the Wendy's hamburger phenomenon. I've never had a Wendy's hamburger at some point in time.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   I decide I never will have one. I just don't want to ever have one.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.520]   Because it's square. No, it's just because I just made a decision. I'm never going to go on second left for you.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.520]   No, you know what? John, you're going to get, you're going to get left out.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.520]   I'm not going to get left. These things come and go. Oh, somebody just gave me a German Shepherd.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:01.520]   This will not come and go. This is the metaverse, John. This is the beginning.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.520]   Yeah, yeah. It's happening. It's happening. I'm going to try.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:10.520]   I'm going to try. It's the beginning of the end for you. Run. Run. No, I love it. I can't leave.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.520]   This is amazing.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:22.520]   In, in, in tech.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:30.520]   You want to do it. You want to do it. All right. You want to do it, baby.
