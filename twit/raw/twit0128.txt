[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.820]   Starting with my old buddy Patrick Norton, ladies and
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580]   gentlemen, now from Techzilla.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.180]   And system on Division III.

[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820]   Alex Lindsey or Alex Alberichs?
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.620]   And we have to decide, did you come for

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.500]   to prove to his wife.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   He's not making the whole TV thing on.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.340]   You know, between 1998 and 2004, I was on television.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.540]   I wish a TV star.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.820]   He ever here at Tech TV?
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.140]   Nobody's here to do it.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.380]   Greg Severson is also here.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.660]   what is the VC show called?
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.420]   Venture Cast.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.740]   Venture Cast, that's right.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.780]   Keep his seat warm.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.860]   I'll play John until that.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.780]   It's really fun for us to have a guy that we used to have
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220]   on the screen savers all the time, Mr. Burtmann Roy here.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.860]   Thank you.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.820]   For my wife, he's a host of Pixel Perfect on Division III.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.780]   But he's also, of course, the king of Photoshop.
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.300]   And are you here showing off a book?
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.260]   Or what brings you to Macworld Expo?
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.260]   What are you pimping this time?
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.500]   Yeah, what are you pimping this time?
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.020]   I'm not pimping anything.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.260]   Well, I do have a new book coming out.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.620]   I do a book every two and a half years.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.180]   So there you go.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.340]   It comes out of Photoshop worlds, a new book.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.860]   All right.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.360]   Go on.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.020]   What's in the bag?
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.460]   What's in the bag?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.820]   An almanac, is it?
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.580]   No.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.340]   It doesn't have a name.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.820]   It has a name.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.260]   Don't say it.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.780]   An almanac.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.660]   Photoshop Studio is something a rather--
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.900]   You don't even know.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.140]   Yeah, it's actually Photoshop Studio with Burtmann Roy,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020]   Colin Digital Painting.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.900]   The reason Burt only does books every two and a half years
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540]   is actually "Goze the Press."
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.860]   That was it, Virginia or somewhere?
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.220]   And you look at all the proofs.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.860]   And you're very detailed.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.340]   It's a long--
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.700]   See, the thing is that I'd rather be in the studio working
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.220]   with this stuff rather than writing about it.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.340]   I also like teaching about it and stuff.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.220]   But to sit there and write about this whole thing,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.180]   and then the editing part, I've read my book about nine times
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.580]   already.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.780]   I'm really sick of reading that book.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.820]   It's option control, damn it, for the last time.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.100]   That's why I never write my own books.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.660]   See, then when I read them, it's fresh.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.300]   It's exciting.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.460]   It's different.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.340]   It's a great technique.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.300]   I highly recommend that.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.380]   OK, everybody cover your eyes.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.820]   I have to make a gesture really quickly.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.260]   Also, today, Alex Lindsey, who's here today.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.220]   He's been here all week.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.500]   He's been the guy who's put together podcast studio.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.780]   He's done a great job, I think.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.220]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.460]   We've spent the last four days talking about podcasts,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.380]   showing podcasts, doing podcasts.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.860]   I really want to thank everyone who came.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.500]   I mean, we really had a fun time.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.260]   It's been a really-- we've had a lot of fun conversations.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.460]   And so I really hope we get to do it again next year.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.460]   And we really had a good time.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.460]   This was a good Mac world.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.580]   Did you get a chance to Patrick to see Mac world at all?
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.060]   I have seen everything at Mac world.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.980]   Yeah, did you like that MacBook Air?
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.940]   What do you think of that?
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.700]   I was one of the eight people who owned a Macintosh duo
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.620]   back in the day.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.140]   I have no problem with having an optical spindle.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.340]   I hear one more person.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.220]   This is how it is.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.300]   You were playing it for battery.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.540]   You don't care about that.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.740]   Well, in one hand, yeah, it would
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.140]   be nice to have a user replaceable battery.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.820]   It's lithium-ion.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.980]   It's a finite life.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.380]   The finite life will end faster than you want it to.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.060]   But Apple says $129 bucks.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.780]   They'll fix it.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.740]   They'll put it into one end.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.700]   I want to see what the price is like when people actually
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.580]   need to replace them in a year or two years.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.380]   That's not-- you know, it would cost about $100 bucks to buy one.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.980]   Absolutely.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.860]   So $129 bucks, that includes the installation.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.420]   That's not that.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.060]   Personally, I think basically, you know, I'm assuming
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.900]   it's a lithium polymer battery.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   So you can get it to take all that acreage.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.580]   You can't really have to pass.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.540]   And it's just--
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.740]   It's a nice looking machine.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.260]   It's-- I just take to see something like that in your hands,
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.140]   though, because I just know you just like snap it like that.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.460]   No, actually--
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.180]   Are you gentle?
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.020]   I think I've actually--
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.380]   I think I've actually--
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.340]   More notes book is alive than you have.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.660]   All right, don't look at me.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.220]   I'm not as bad as Lauterback.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.660]   True.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.180]   The killer.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.860]   The killer.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.780]   Well, yeah, well, I've actually--
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.540]   one of the funniest-- one of my very first vendor
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.420]   meetings with Jim Raderback was with Zenith when Zenith still
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.580]   made notebooks.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.060]   And apparently--
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.980]   That's how long ago it was.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.380]   Yeah, this was like 1995.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.260]   And so he reaches forward to turn the notebook around
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.620]   because he wants to check the keyboard, right?
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.340]   Because it's like the first thing you want to do is,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.500]   how's the keyboard feel?
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.740]   And it was like a mother leaping in front of a tiger
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.140]   to protect her baby.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.020]   Jim, what are we doing?
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.660]   Don't break it too long.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.220]   We have the entire media tour.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.020]   He was like, I'll be gentle.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.780]   His reputation preceded him, I think.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.260]   Well, he had actually, I guess, dropped one
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.460]   on their previous media tour.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.500]   I've never seen anybody break more notebooks.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.180]   So you think you might maybe get one of those for yourself
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.460]   or Mrs. Norton or perhaps?
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.100]   Well, I've got a fairly young MacBook that's--
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220]   Yeah, me too.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.940]   I think actually has the same or a faster processor in it.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.460]   So I'm going to keep that rolling for a while.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.780]   But hey, if I play the lotto and win, who knows?
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.860]   Baby shoes or a new Mac--
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.020]   How is Maricai doing now?
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.300]   He's more to Kai.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.820]   More to Kai.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.460]   More to Kai.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.580]   Lock on him.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.700]   The--
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.740]   No, you're Malek.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.740]   Mine's Malekai.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.260]   It's OK.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.500]   Baby's doing good.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.620]   We had a really great spade of sleeping from like 9 until 4.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.620]   And now we're back to sort of the erratic sleeping.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.740]   He's grown like 19 inches in three months.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.180]   You know, my kid's 13.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.580]   He still doesn't sleep through the night.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.540]   So just get used to it.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.700]   I'm still trying to get over the idea
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.180]   that the tiny creature you brought on the set back in the day
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.620]   is now driving.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.300]   Oh, Abby, yeah, she drove me here.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.900]   Does she know how to use turn signals?
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.380]   How did she get her driver's license in California?
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.020]   She's a learner's permit.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.660]   So California used to teach kids.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.420]   You know, the class schools used to teach kids.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.180]   Now they just go, now go ahead.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.780]   You have Abby.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   Hey, you know, it's part of being 43rd in the nation
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.540]   and education.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.900]   And actually those cuts, I think,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.460]   are going to really help us get down into the bottom 49 or 50.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.460]   Here comes Arkansas.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460]   Hey.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.100]   So we're-- so--
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.220]   I would like to point out that even before I had a child,
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.380]   I was bitter about the pathetic state of education
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.940]   in California.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.700]   You said your kid is school here.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.780]   So yeah, she gets in the car and you drive with her.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.280]   Right.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.460]   And you're driving a stick?
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.740]   No, no, it's automatic.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.140]   She got it.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.100]   She drove to Lexus.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.340]   But we-- she drove all the way to Lexus.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.780]   She drove to Lexus.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.740]   She says, damn, I like this car.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.780]   I don't like it too much.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.300]   It's so smooth.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.500]   It's much nicer than mom's Toyota van.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.140]   And once she drove all the way to San Francisco,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.140]   she parked in this garage.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.220]   I said, honey, I've scraped my car many a time
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.460]   on the poles in this garage.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.140]   This is a killer garage drive carefully.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.180]   She did a beautiful job.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.620]   And then we drove home.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.740]   I was-- I had my--
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.380]   [GRUNTING]
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.340]   But we made it.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.120]   Now, my first drive in a loaders permit
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.920]   was from Dandborough, Pennsylvania, population 8
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.360]   to Newark Airport on a Thursday afternoon,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.720]   across Route 22.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.220]   Good load.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.600]   It was great, because you know what?
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.440]   Everything else has been painfully easy,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.920]   since then.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.360]   What do you like to drive?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.400]   It's good.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.640]   I was a cab driver in New York a long time.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.120]   Were you?
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.200]   You sound like a cab.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.800]   You want to talk about driving, OK?
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.440]   When you're going down Lexington Avenue,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   and a hand goes up, four blocks down,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.400]   you've got six other guys are driving.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.360]   [CHEERING]
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   Yeah, I was driving.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   Yeah, I was driving.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.160]   How long did you do that?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.660]   I didn't know you were a cab driver.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.460]   I drove for about the four months.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.900]   That's all I could take.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.540]   That's got to be the world's toughest job.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.260]   That was tough.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.340]   Yeah, that was tough.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.500]   That's got to be murdered.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.420]   It's 12-hour shift, and it's very competitive.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.700]   And you don't have to drive--
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.820]   it resists in a really tight area.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.620]   So the legs have to be wide open,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.420]   so the steering wheel can fit in there.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.060]   And you get some weird people in the back seat.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.820]   You were driving probably one of those old--
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.000]   those beautiful-- what were they called?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.500]   Chequer cats.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.560]   Chequer cats, marathon.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.320]   No, I'm old, but not that old.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.240]   Oh, I loved them.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.200]   Poor galaxy.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.800]   They'd have the drop down, the seat.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.040]   Yeah, two little seats.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.920]   Actually, I've gone back for a little while there.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.400]   But now they're gone.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   I drove one of those little ones.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.920]   So this is-- to me, this seems like Macworld is revived.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.320]   It seems like this show is like the old Macworld expo--
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   it's no longer the iPod or even iPhone accessory show.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.960]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   Would you agree, Burm?
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.720]   I was expecting to be an iPhone show.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.780]   Like last year was an iPod--
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.680]   I remember last year I counted 42 vendors with something
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.500]   sleethed for iPod.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.280]   And so I was expecting an iPhone show.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   But I was surprised that it has kind of come back
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.140]   to what it was, that energy's in the air, which is cool.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.100]   Software vendors have come back into its--
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   there's software out there, not just iPhone cases.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.980]   Right, and they're little software vendors, too.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.420]   I think Leoparders really helped with people
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.700]   being able to develop software cheaply and really beautifully.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.660]   So I'm seeing a lot more of the smaller software vendors out
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.020]   there that's really making beautiful things.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.220]   So that's also exciting to actually see them here in person
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.060]   and talk with them and try them out.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.620]   Alex, you follow the kind of the content creation space.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.260]   I mean, Apple's always kind of been the leader in that space.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.580]   Yeah, I mean, I think that one of the things that makes it--
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.260]   and we not only follow it, we make content software.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.700]   So--
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.700]   Dv Garage.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   The Dv Madden and Conduit and so on and so forth.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.540]   And so one of the things we know is that there's
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.740]   a lot of things that you can just do on a Mac because of Core Audio,
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.700]   because of Core Video and now because of Core Animation.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.380]   The tools that Apple gives us to get this stuff done
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.260]   makes it easier from a developer's point of view
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.980]   because I don't have to figure out what the situation is.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.540]   I don't have to figure out how to get in and out
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.780]   of the computer-- in and out of the video camera
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.100]   or an audio device.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.820]   I just tell the operating system, give me that input.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.220]   And if someone builds a card that's compliant and I'm compliant,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.980]   I don't have to do all the work in between.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.540]   And that's why we have all these cool little applications that
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.860]   look pretty and do cool things.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.380]   Is there any CHD Native support in Final Cut Pro yet?
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.140]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.980]   You know, I don't know.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.380]   I think so, didn't they update it?
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.660]   Yeah, I think there is.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.420]   I'll tell you, there is in, of course, iMovie.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.860]   And there is a Final Cut Express.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.580]   I believe they update it.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.500]   I don't do Final Cut Express anymore.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.000]   I know.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.340]   Ever since the incident.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.140]   What was the incident?
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.460]   Well, the incident was that we got Final Cut Express,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.140]   and we found out the reason it did a lot of things poorly
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.780]   is because it turns out to be-- or at least did a lot of things
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.220]   differently from Final Cut Pro as a certain well-informed person
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.660]   told me it's an entirely different code base from Final Cut
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:10.660]   Pro.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.160]   Is it really?
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.620]   I didn't know that.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.380]   And then right about the time we realized
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.860]   we needed to upgrade to Final Cut Pro
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.660]   to get some of the tools we needed,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.260]   they basically eliminated the ability
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.660]   to buy Final Cut Pro at a discounted upgrade
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.820]   or without buying the multi-thousand dollar package
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.940]   of accessories around it.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.820]   I've been using Express.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.340]   I'm happy with it.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.900]   I have no idea.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.620]   It's a different program.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.020]   It's a wonderful editing program.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.780]   But if you're in a production environment,
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.500]   you basically need to be all one or all the other.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.220]   It's not really designed for that.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.100]   Express was really designed for the individual editor
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.100]   who wants to get started.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.180]   I got to say Adobe Premiere, the latest version,
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.260]   is so good for a program.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260]   It's incredible to watch the changes they've made.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.020]   That's a good program.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.340]   And they aren't thinking about production environments.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.940]   And even Premiere Elements is still
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.660]   a pretty darn good program for the low end.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.140]   I mean, for under 100 bucks.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.660]   Google accidentally-- I guess it was a Google PR person
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.060]   announced-- whoops.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.260]   That-- I guess this is from TechCrunch,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.660]   Duncan Riley writing in TechCrunch.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.260]   She says, I asked if Picasa for Mac was coming,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.140]   and his luck would have it.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.500]   I managed to pick the Google employee with the least
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   amount of media training.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.940]   Her response, Picasa for the Mac, is under development.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.060]   And we'll be launched later this year shortly afterwards.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.020]   She tried backtracking.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.380]   And it's the point of meeting somebody who
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.540]   would give her the right answer.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.460]   You heard from the news.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.220]   But that's good news.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.340]   I mean, that means even Google's looking
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.620]   at Mac and Tasha's being a--
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.180]   Plus preview is like the worst photo previewing application
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:27.820]   ever invented.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.420]   No, yeah.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:28.980]   You mean--
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.220]   Like, it's great for PDFs.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.860]   No, well, just in terms of-- I'm so used to Windows,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.540]   where you can basically--
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.420]   Oh, the built-in Mac is skimmed through.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.980]   Yeah, the one that's built into OS 10.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.780]   No, I think it'll be nice to have a Picasa.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.860]   I think that's a great program.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.020]   And iPhoto has always been a little bit of a laggard.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.060]   And I think it will be nice to have competition,
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.980]   if nothing else.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.580]   Big story this week, it actually came out yesterday.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.060]   Yahoo is going to start supporting OpenID
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.340]   for the single sign-on.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.740]   That's huge.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.580]   That puts OpenID on the map.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.980]   In fact, they announced that they will be offering
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.020]   all current account holders a chance
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.940]   to upgrade OpenID accounts.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.780]   Yes, Mr. Norton.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.940]   What's an OpenID?
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.780]   I have no idea.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.420]   I just was reading the story out of it.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.540]   OpenID is this-- remember Passport, Microsoft Passport,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.820]   that eel faded?
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.340]   So who manages OpenID?
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.500]   Nobody.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.100]   Which means it's only much more secure and reliable.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.260]   The accountability there is just staggering.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.180]   It's an open source standard.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.220]   And you can choose an OpenID vendor.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.940]   The people control it, Mr. LaPorte.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.140]   Well, people control it.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.300]   In this case, for instance, Yahoo agrees to support OpenID.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.420]   It supports the standards, the API.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   And then they can interface.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.500]   So for instance, you could come a Twit.tv support.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.460]   It does support.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.060]   We don't currently use it.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.540]   But you could go there.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.540]   And instead of using a Twit login,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.300]   you could use your Yahoo login.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.420]   So this isn't just shopping.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.420]   This could be like controlling all of my Passport
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.500]   everywhere and everything.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.420]   Our friend Kevin is going to be doing it at Dig.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.420]   In fact, I think he is doing OpenID at Dig.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.580]   So that's good news with Yahoo behind it.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.700]   AOL has also announced they're going to support it.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.940]   I think OpenID finally will live up to the promise
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.020]   that Passport-- I love the idea.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.820]   I signed up for a Passport account.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.780]   But nobody wanted to play with Microsoft.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.100]   I was like, Microsoft owns it.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.100]   We don't want to do it.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.420]   Somehow we thought that might be bad.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.180]   I don't know why.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.700]   I can't understand that.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.220]   I have to say, I was very pleased to see Office 2008.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.060]   Oh my god.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.660]   That was--
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.540]   Until native?
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.660]   Until native.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.420]   OK, so if you have an older Mac,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.380]   the early testing says on G5 and earlier Macs.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.100]   Performance slower.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.380]   But if you have an Intel-based Mac, performance better.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.140]   And the interface--
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.740]   I just love it.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.140]   It's basically the Office 2007 Windows interface.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.900]   It's just--
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.500]   Yeah, they can't do the ribbon 100% unfortunately,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   because Macintosh API guidelines require that you support
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.900]   Macintosh dropdown windows.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.620]   But they kind of-- they fuzzed it, which
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.500]   I thought they did a good job, where you could push a button
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.380]   and then you get the ribbon.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.420]   Well, it's such a desperately needed upgrade.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.100]   I agree.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.860]   It was a laggard program.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.660]   Other stories-- you might like this, Patrick.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.260]   I know you're in a car fanatic.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.380]   I was surprised you weren't actually
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.820]   at the Detroit Auto Show.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.260]   I thought you might.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.140]   I've never managed to make any of the auto shows.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.740]   It seems like that would be something you would like to do.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.700]   I'd never have enough seniority or something.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.220]   Big surprise at the Detroit Auto Show,
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.860]   the Prius offer is not going to offer a plug-in hybrid.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.260]   They've actually-- I haven't seen the specs for the new one.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.340]   But they've actually offered an EV mode everywhere but the US
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.620]   since 2004.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.420]   And you can basically-- the heart of the EV hacks
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.020]   that people have been doing over at Cal-Davy.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.060]   Where basically you take out the existing battery packs,
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.020]   you put in more powerful battery packs.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.140]   And you basically buy a $14 switch that says electric mode
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.140]   or EV mode from the Toyota dealership and wire it in place.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.420]   So it's kind of the best of both worlds.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.980]   It's a plug-in car.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.380]   You can charge the batteries and run electric fully.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.740]   But you always have a gas engine,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.660]   so you don't have to be near a plug.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.140]   I think it's real demand for this.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.660]   Yeah, and more batteries should be great.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.580]   I mean, one of the things we're playing around on system--
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.860]   and I'm trying to figure out whether we can fit it
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.420]   in the budget is for my commuter vehicle,
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.780]   basically turning either a 68 Mustang or a 57 F100
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.060]   into an electric vehicle.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.620]   How many batteries is it going to have?
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.380]   You have to have the whole bed of the F100.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.340]   What's interesting is when you look at-- when you start--
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.900]   not really.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.100]   I mean, one of the most interesting ones I've seen--
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.140]   if you have millions of dollars you go lithium-ion
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.820]   and you have this incredibly dense battery pack,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.820]   and even the companies that have millions of dollars--
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.660]   Aren't they expensive?
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.540]   Most people like, for instance, this Prius is using--
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.260]   I think nickel cadmium or nickel metal high.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.180]   Lithium-ion's expensive, and it's challenging
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.340]   for the charging environment.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.460]   I mean, it's funny.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.900]   It's people are like, let acid is evil.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.340]   You can't use let acid batteries.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.660]   And the truth is, it's actually one of the best managed--
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.300]   It's very efficient.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.580]   --recycling stories in the United States.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.140]   In terms of actually a very miniscule percentage of batteries
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.340]   actually don't get recycled because the materials inside of them
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.980]   are valuable, and it's something that there's
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.860]   been so much awareness on basically--
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.420]   The negative on them is they're big and heavy.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.140]   They're big and heavy.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.980]   But I've seen a Porsche 959 converted into electric vehicle,
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.900]   and they actually managed to shoehorn.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:59.180]   I think it was 20 pretty big, aneurysus batteries inside of that.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.580]   I just want mine to run off laptop batteries.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.700]   If you get enough laptop batteries--
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.700]   That's what it is.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.540]   Well, there's a certain--
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.580]   That's what the Tesla is.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.940]   Yeah, except they can't seem to get their battery supply straight
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.700]   into that.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   Were you on the show?
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.660]   Calicana says he's ordered a Tesla.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.140]   I know.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.060]   I actually know two people who have ordered Tesla.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.100]   It's not expensive to order.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.300]   It's expensive to buy.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.340]   Well, the problem is it's--
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.980]   Yeah, well, even if you put it down,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.260]   payment is not expensive to order.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.020]   But they just got rid of their CTO,
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.220]   the production's difficult to aid,
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.060]   and it all keeps wrapping around battery issues
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.540]   and battery availability.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.300]   And a transmission issue too.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.420]   But I think transmission--
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.060]   Just buy one of those and take the batteries out
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.380]   and put in your 68 Mustang.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.380]   Yeah, well, that takes it from an $8,000 or $4,000 project
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.660]   to a $100,000.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.160]   You know.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.660]   It's falling.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.620]   So you're going to do this on system, though?
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.860]   I'm trying to figure out a way to make it work financially.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.620]   Well, that's the idea.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.780]   I think it's really exciting because I think that we
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.940]   can talk a lot about ethanol.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.180]   We can talk a lot about all these other things that we can do.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.780]   Ethanol is evil.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.620]   Ethanol is a big one.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.620]   I was stunned.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.380]   I was stunned.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:57.900]   I was stunned.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.900]   I was stunned.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.220]   Well, it takes more natural gas, more gasoline to produce ethanol
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.740]   than it would be to just use the gas.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.860]   There's other issues.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.620]   I mean, you have not only does it take more energy,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.860]   but you're using up an enormous amount of water,
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.820]   and you're running the corn prices into the ceiling.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.320]   Right.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.740]   So feed, which is used for feed.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.420]   And poly.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.220]   So beer's getting more expensive.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.980]   Well, that then won't be the worst.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.700]   They're going corn instead of barley.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.540]   I didn't know that.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.420]   Yeah, it's bad.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.540]   Oh, man.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.060]   Stop.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.580]   So suntory is going to be expensive.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.380]   That's the corn beer.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.780]   Yeah, but I think that from--
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.180]   I really think that electric is--
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.020]   whether we back it up with gas or ethanol or whatever,
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.380]   I think electric is really what we need to be getting to,
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.420]   because that means we can centralize where the power is
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:39.980]   coming from.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.500]   And then if we change--
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.820]   Then you can use efficiency.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.460]   We don't want to do is keep on trying to upgrade gas and
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.020]   to say what's going on.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.580]   I mean, gasoline is like--
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.980]   I mean, what a lot of people that
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.020]   realize is gasoline is this incredibly efficient means
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.860]   of transporting potential kinetics energy.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.860]   It's a lot of energy in a gas.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.660]   A lot of energy in a gas.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.660]   And it could--
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.540]   vast, I mean, not an order of magnitude, but probably--
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.540]   I want to say three times as much energy in a cubic meter
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.140]   of liquid gas, and there isn't a cubic meter of liquid hydrogen.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.660]   Really?
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.020]   I mean, it's--
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.660]   It also blows up more slowly.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.900]   Well, it all depends on how you store it, right?
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.260]   The--
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.020]   More controlled.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.860]   Or can't.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.100]   It's all about how it blows up when it hits that bridge at 170.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.180]   But I mean, it's also interesting, but there's so many--
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.020]   you got Archer Midland and all these big companies that are
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.500]   really pushing ethanol.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.660]   So they have the lobbyists.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.420]   Everybody wants farmers to not get subsidized and make
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.060]   their own living, and that sounds great.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.980]   But it's also interesting to realize--
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.980]   there's a great-- I think it's Popular Mechanics this month
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.460]   has a spectacular article on ethanol and why it really--
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.260]   we need a plan.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260]   There's going to be-- there's no single point--
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.420]   there's no single source to replace gasoline.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.300]   We need to try a whole bunch of different stuff.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.980]   Sawgrass, baby.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.460]   You know what?
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.980]   If somebody will show me some sawgrass growing in a field
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.380]   and then convert it into something,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.660]   I'll be excited about sawgrass.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.460]   Everybody's very excited about sawgrass, I don't know.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.060]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.580]   They'll be a different way.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.420]   So this is a more traditional story.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.460]   Sun Microsystems says they're going to plunk down a billion
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.380]   dollars and buy mine.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.780]   SQL.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.980]   That just blows my mind.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.580]   I thought it was an open source project,
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.900]   but apparently it's a business available for sale.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.780]   Is Sun that desperate for a business model?
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.580]   Ouch, did I say that out loud?
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.100]   Well, now Sun has done a lot of open source, of course.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.140]   I have a family member that makes a living off of dealing
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.020]   with like sun upgrades and migrations.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.540]   Oh, well, he's on-- there goes your--
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.500]   Thanksgiving in here.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.100]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.420]   So MySQL is one of the most successful open source
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.660]   companies.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.860]   Of course, MySQL runs many, many websites.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860]   It's part of the lamp.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.420]   Absolutely.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.860]   And the company had planned to go public of all things,
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.300]   but Sun came along with a really big check.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.580]   And they say the MySQL's revenue was $60 million a year.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   So a billion isn't that out of the--
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.220]   that's one and a half times earnings.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.740]   Doesn't that-- I don't know.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.660]   Because we're so good on the financial side of the business.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.940]   Yeah, I probably shouldn't be the guy to talk about it.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.740]   Well, OK, is it going to make MySQL better or worse?
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.940]   That's an interesting question.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.140]   I think having something like Sun behind it
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.260]   would have something maybe what helps stable.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.500]   Because I mean, there are some amazing engineers at Sun.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.420]   It's not like there's no dearth of talent over there.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.340]   Right.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.220]   Or not like there's an aid dearth of talent over there.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.580]   Ultimately, like no veil acquiring SUSA,
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.020]   it's kind of a seal of approval for the open source
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.460]   community.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.940]   It means this is a business.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.980]   Sorry, I was about to say it means a lawsuit's coming?
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.340]   Yeah, here comes Sko.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.540]   Stand back.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.300]   All right, let me see.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   Oh, other financial news.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.900]   I know you're excited about financial news.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.820]   This was a very-- last year, 2007,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.860]   was a very good year for gaming.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:45.860]   Sales of all gaming titles and machines up 43%, $17.94 billion
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.900]   in sales.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.260]   I mean, it is a huge market.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.900]   And guess who was the big winner?
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.140]   I don't think I'd be surprised.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.140]   Well, of course, EA, but Nintendo.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.540]   Really?
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.780]   Nintendo, the DS, which has been able to make enough,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.980]   I've sold 2.47 million units in December.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.100]   So 1 in every 150 Americans has a DS.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.660]   That's one month.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.620]   8 and 1/2 million units the entire year.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.660]   The Wii, of course, if they could have made more,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.340]   would have done even better.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.860]   1.35 million wheeze in December.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.860]   6 million systems plus over the year.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.540]   Wow.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.700]   Really, it's been a big year for Nintendo.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.140]   Are they making a lot of money on the Wii?
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.500]   That's an interesting question.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.060]   I mean, I wish they--
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.140]   They're more than what their margin is.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.620]   They say they're making a million plus a month,
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.460]   and they can't keep them in stock.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.660]   They obviously could make more money
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.780]   if they could just make them faster.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.580]   I just think it's amazing that there's a video game that
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.620]   actually makes me sore.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.500]   You know, like I played it, I would say in a friend's house,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.340]   and I started playing it.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.300]   There's a joke in there somewhere, but I'm not sure.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.500]   I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.820]   Like, I just-- I couldn't move my arm the next day,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.300]   and I was like, you know, and pour my back, or anything.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.420]   And I was--
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.860]   I thought this is what I need.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.020]   I mean, if I'm going to play video games,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.780]   you can get a little less--
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.780]   Another exciting way to get repetitive strain injuries.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   Exactly.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.300]   Those lawsuits come five years from now.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.540]   Oh, no.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.100]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.460]   Sony did well in December with PS3 moving,
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.820]   but not nearly as well, even as the Xbox 360.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.380]   It's certainly not as well as the Wii.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.860]   I think, though, what has become very clear,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.700]   a victory for Blu-ray.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.780]   Or at least a nasty setback for HEDV.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.220]   Big time.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.420]   That was one of the big rumors floating around at CES
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.980]   that the price for Warner to abandon HEDV was $500 million.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.500]   Hey.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:27.980]   It was worth it.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.900]   Totally unsubstant-- well, if they actually
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.780]   made a kill off HEDV.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.900]   Well, HEDV canceled its conference, press conference.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.060]   I mean, it basically went away with their tail
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.420]   between their legs.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.620]   I have to think that Blu-ray is kind of, at least
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.340]   in the minds of consumers, a victor.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.380]   And if consumers start buying Blu-ray players as a result,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.580]   I think that's all over.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.620]   We talked a little bit about that last week.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.980]   The interesting story on--
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.380]   Great.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   We can get the bad interface and the more expensive hardware.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.140]   Well, that's right.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.300]   And that's the interesting thing.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.340]   The PS3 really is the Blu-ray player of choice,
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.220]   because the new 2.0 spec requires the Blu-ray player be
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.260]   networked.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.980]   And in order to upgrade, you're going
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.340]   to need not only a networked player,
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.780]   but a player that has upgradable firmware or a hard drive,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.020]   like the PS3.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.260]   So it looks like, really, if you're going to buy a PS3,
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.100]   buy a Blu-ray player.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.460]   I would--
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.300]   I wouldn't feel so bad about this.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.660]   If it didn't seem like Sony had to buy themselves out
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.860]   of a bad position.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.660]   There's no--
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.500]   the HEDV players seem better implemented.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.060]   The interface is more fun to use.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.620]   The original--
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:30.940]   I mean--
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.460]   I agree with you.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   I liked HEDV.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.020]   A lot.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.380]   I was--
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.540]   See, it's dead to you already.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.540]   It's always over.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.300]   I liked HEDV.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.340]   The late great.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.460]   It was a nice spec.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:39.980]   D-V.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.420]   Discs are dead, so--
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.580]   Do you think that's the question is, did they resolve
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.060]   this conflict in time to see even save discs?
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.660]   Or are people just going to move right to downloadable?
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.460]   And look at Apple II.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.020]   Downloadable.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.060]   But the video quality, the difference in quality--
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.220]   if you've got a 42-inch or bigger screen,
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:57.860]   there's a--
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.860]   The question I have is, what is the percentage of people
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.060]   who have 42-inch or bigger?
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.980]   I mean, that's--
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.580]   I think we're very quickly getting to 2% or 3%
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.460]   of the population.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.460]   I mean, I go to most people's houses.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.420]   Does that mean 0.5% of the population owns an HEDV
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.660]   or a Blu-ray player then?
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   It's a very small number.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.420]   Very small.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.740]   Because if you look at the CEA numbers,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.180]   there's an astonishing number of HEDV's being sold every month.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.540]   Oh, no, there's an enormous number of them.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.020]   It's still a fraction of the total ownership.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.820]   Yeah, but I--
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.420]   Or the size.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:24.980]   I guess my--
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.620]   How big are these sets?
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.340]   There's a lot of HD-- I have an HD set,
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.780]   but it's 37 inches.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.260]   Right.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.300]   I'm not going to see the difference between 720 and 1080p.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.620]   Yeah, but a lot of the online delivery,
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.420]   there's some of the online delivery just looks crummy.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.540]   And you think Comcast looks OK?
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.500]   No, I think Comcast--
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.500]   You know, I was on a panel at CES with the president
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.780]   of the National Cable Television Association, which
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.140]   was a really interesting moment for me
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.380]   because we started talking about the business model for cable
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.500]   and startups, and obviously my experience at Tech TV
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.260]   waited on that.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.580]   But--
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.020]   You know, positively, I'm sure.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:01.820]   Yeah, positively.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.380]   Well, look, Comcast quality in San Francisco is atrocious.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.820]   It's pathetic.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.260]   The SD channels look like hell.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.060]   The SD channels don't look much better.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.740]   But I mean, if I'm going to be like, if it's an HD format,
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.220]   I don't want to see compression artifacts and action scenes.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.820]   And most of the online delivery is basically slightly
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.860]   better than DVD quality.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.460]   I look forward to--
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.980]   I've got my Apple TV primed up.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.660]   It's back out of the box in the basement where it's been sitting.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.820]   You know, going to connect it.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.100]   I'm going to rent some movies.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.780]   And the early specs, the resolutions
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.940]   are still sort of centering around 720p.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.420]   It doesn't seem to be a 16 by 9 format.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.540]   It doesn't say 16 by 9.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.100]   No, it's like 2.35 to 1 or 2.5.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.060]   It's a non--
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.580]   the Engadget folks actually spent a bunch of time
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.860]   downloading the movies and inspecting them through iTunes.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.420]   So--
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.180]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.860]   Well, I don't want the letterboxed on the 16.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.060]   Slightly.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.980]   So I mean, I've less than before.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.300]   Yeah, I mean, if somebody can give me like 720p or better,
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.220]   like full 720p quality, I'll be thrilled.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.260]   If it's more like 720-ish, you know,
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.100]   that's highly compressed, I'm not so thrilled.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.500]   Because that's the promise of this.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.460]   The X-Treme HD guys, we're talking up a storm at CES.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.660]   We're talking about doing basically Netflix delivery
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.780]   via satellite for all intents and purposes.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.420]   So you'll have a box.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.220]   You'll server in your house and a box next to your television.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   And they're going to be downloading basically like full or
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.100]   closer to full Blu-ray or AC DVD quality movies.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.260]   Will it work?
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.860]   Well, they don't have any studio agreements.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.100]   I think that part of it is it doesn't have to be that--
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.540]   I mean, because I'm a perfectionist.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.620]   I want it to be all perfect.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.660]   You shoot family videos with a $600,000 studio.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.420]   That's true.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.220]   And I say that with love and respect, because you're
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.420]   my kind of geek.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.820]   But I believe he does.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.460]   The man sees things that normal humans cannot,
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.740]   because that's what you do.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.860]   It's your job.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.260]   So I do love that end of it.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.660]   But the question that I have is, are we
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.180]   going to get to a point where it's good enough for most
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:05.660]   of the population?
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.220]   My parents have an HD set or something
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.780]   that they call an HD set.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.740]   They think it's HD.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.740]   They think it's HD.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.260]   Right.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:12.900]   And it looks--
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.980]   It's a big TV.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.380]   I mean, it looks-- I don't think it's
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.580]   any sharper than it was before.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.500]   And it's fine for them.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.340]   And the thing is, is that as we get to--
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.060]   I mean, I'm watching DVDs on my 37-inch HD, whatever.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:27.780]   They look OK.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.860]   I mean, sure they're not as sharp as they'd be.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.260]   My favorite-- like, if you watch Casino Royale, right?
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:33.780]   There's The Big.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.500]   There's The Chase.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.580]   There's an explosion in the beginning in the elevator shaft.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.660]   That is the best demonstration of compression artifacts
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.300]   I've ever seen in my life.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.860]   Because you throw that on an HD TV.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.220]   And basically, all you can see is--
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.420]   Giant blocks of compression, right?
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.100]   And yeah, admittedly, if I'm watching--
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.620]   And you're watching that on Blu-ray?
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.140]   No.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.660]   No.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.820]   I'm the DVD version of that.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.420]   And actually, the downloadable versions of that.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.820]   So now I would love to get you to compare the Blu-ray version
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.100]   of that.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.540]   It's significantly better.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.580]   I would think.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.540]   I take Alex's point.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.300]   It's sort of like you drink enough until she's cute.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.180]   It's the same thing we found, I think, with--
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.700]   no, wait, let me finish.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.140]   I don't know.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.580]   I think it's a pretty good point.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.220]   What we've seen with iTunes and with music,
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.420]   if it's convenient enough, it's going to look better and better.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.700]   I mean, a 128, in my opinion.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.540]   A 128-bit MP3 is atrocious.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.180]   Absolutely.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.700]   Atrocious.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.460]   But it's the same as a 4.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460]   It's the same as a 4.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.700]   But they've sold 4--
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.500]   It's the standard.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.020]   Billion.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.700]   You know, not million, but billion.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.180]   Right.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.700]   Well, I'm looking at what Netflix is doing.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.100]   Of course, Netflix jumping the gun because of this Apple
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.580]   announcement.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.860]   And admittedly, they're not very good looking.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.100]   They're not downloaded.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.420]   But they're available.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.940]   They're free.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.780]   They're right there.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.060]   I know.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.420]   But there's parts made that like--
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:45.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.500]   If you're going to go to the point where you're getting a say.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.980]   And in a couple of years, everybody's
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.340]   going to have a 1080p television.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.940]   Because that's just-- you know what I mean?
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.300]   It's the consumer adoption.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.460]   The consumer electronics adoption cycle.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.140]   In two years, 42-inch, 1080p television,
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   it's going to be $8.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.660]   It's going to come in a box of Cracker Jacks,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.580]   or it's going to feel that way.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.580]   They're going to give them away when you sign up for a new toaster
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:04.860]   at the time.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.300]   Two years?
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.020]   This is going to happen?
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.020]   Three years.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.540]   Three and a half tops.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.900]   And I don't particularly-- I have a problem with basically
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.220]   what's happening with music production.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.380]   I'm tired of new albums basically having everything
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.620]   compressed to the point where there's no low and no high.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.980]   But the pop can't compete unless there's basically
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.580]   no dynamic range in the music.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.740]   They're from compressors on.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.980]   I don't want to overcompress the video.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.020]   I don't want to lose--
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.460]   I don't want to be watching somebody's spectacular
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.820]   cinematic effort, whether it's shot on the digital or film.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.340]   They've gone through all this effort to produce what is art.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.540]   You're there.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.820]   You're down.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.420]   I think actually you and Alex are a lot alike in this respect.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.260]   And I think you have higher standards than most of America.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.380]   Well, I mean, look, I too have sung along with AM radio
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.980]   that sounded like ass fading in and out.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.740]   Just it's right.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.500]   And it's a wonderful mythical experience.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.660]   It's a very American thing.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.660]   But if I'm in my home, I don't want
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.660]   to be watching bad quality.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   Why would I--
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.820]   The other reality is that a lot of studies
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.860]   show that if your monitor isn't bigger than 60 inches,
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.820]   and you're not closer than 10 feet to the screen,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.060]   you can't tell if you can't tell the difference between 720p
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.940]   or 1080p.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.460]   Sure.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.340]   I'm not arguing.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.660]   Yeah, the point is this is America, damn it.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.820]   And we have choices.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.180]   So Patrick's--
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   You bring on the free view.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.660]   Now you're telling me that.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.620]   I'm re-inoprising--
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.100]   We got a flag.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.940]   I confused something other than cable or DSL in my local community.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.140]   It's your dish.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.500]   So I mean, so I love convenience.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.660]   My family loves convenience.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.460]   I don't really care about the fidelity of a movie at home.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.860]   If I really, really want good fidelity,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.100]   I'm going to go to Good Cinema.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.380]   If I were on a really good experience,
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.820]   I'm going to go to a Good Cinema.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.020]   So it's all about a free enterprise.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.500]   Let's ask Mr. Normal here, Bert Monroe, who has--
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.020]   Who?
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   Mr. Normal?
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.020]   Mr. Normal.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.020]   He's got a great eyes.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020]   He's in the art this man sees.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.180]   He sees everything.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.020]   What do you have at home?
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.020]   What do you watch at Harvard?
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.580]   Well, I actually have a 43-inch cinema display, you know,
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.740]   big plasma.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.460]   I don't watch it much, because I pretty much
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.420]   sit in front of my two-cent cheeks with my 30-inch apple.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.060]   And I look at the--
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.900]   You're spoils out here.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.900]   You're spoils out of postcards.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.780]   You spoiled like a 30-inch display.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.020]   I'm looking at everything at 1,600% magnification.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.020]   Right.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.820]   So the stuff you're looking at, I--
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.300]   What do you have to watch movies at home or anything like that?
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.860]   Yeah, I used to do that a long time ago.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.460]   I have to go to the movie in ages.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.300]   Back when you were a cabbie.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   Citizen Kane is really--
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.340]   Well, actually, I'll watch, like, when Pixar comes out
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:25.940]   with a new movie.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.620]   I'll go to a movie to see that.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.140]   I'll go to the theater to see that.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.500]   The whole experience of sitting in a chair for that many hours
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.300]   uncomfortably.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.660]   Can't go to the bathroom.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.900]   That kind of stuff.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.980]   But I pretty much spend my life in front of my screens.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.500]   And--
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.580]   So you have enough screen time.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.940]   You don't want to spend any more time?
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.260]   Yeah, I'd rather make my pixels than watch somebody else's
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.380]   pixels.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.700]   I want to interrupt a little bit,
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.100]   because we want to welcome a sponsor.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.860]   It says, special sponsor for our Macworld shows.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.260]   It's iStockPhoto.com.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.660]   And I'm sure you've heard of iStockPhoto.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.140]   Yay.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.100]   I use them a lot, do you?
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.380]   Free presentations?
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:32:59.940]   It's for a long time.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.460]   They're the world's busiest, highest volume image market.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.340]   So for people like Craig Severson, a designer,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.420]   somebody who's putting together presentations,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.780]   it's a great place to start looking for stock photo images.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.860]   Great image quality, huge selection.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.460]   Two and 1/2 million images, 60,000 videos.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:20.420]   There are 30,000 more added each week from the world.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.940]   And the price is very affordable.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.460]   Images starting as low as $1 for web use.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.940]   Video clips as low as $5.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.020]   If you're doing presentations, as Craig is,
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.420]   you can get videos or images from $1 to $50.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.220]   It's really-- actually, you can get whole presentations,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:34.820]   can't you?
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.540]   You can get templates.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.940]   But I got cows.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.820]   I really wanted a cow for this one particular shot.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.660]   And iStockPhoto.com.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.140]   I got my cow--
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   It's a revolution for photographers.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.900]   People who want to sell their photos as well.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.540]   You know, stock videographers as well.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.460]   Well, I think it's great they're doing video.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.620]   So you know you're going to be on a site
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.300]   where there are a lot of people looking.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.740]   So you have a better chance of getting seen.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.860]   It's a free market.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.060]   It's a little man has a chance.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.380]   It is.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:33:59.780]   It's great.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.340]   I mean, it's what the internet was all about.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.100]   These friction-free markets contribute
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.740]   to make up to 40% from each image or video they sell on the site.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.060]   In fact, they tell me at iStockPhoto,
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.420]   there are many photographers and videographers
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.340]   now who quit their jobs and just upload to iStockPhoto.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.900]   And they make a living up to 200,000 a year just doing this.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.460]   I think it's great.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.420]   A supplemental income for most of you.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   Most of you are not going to make 200,000.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.460]   But I think it's a great idea.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.340]   iStockPhoto.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.340]   Now, we've got to special the 20% off your first purchase
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.580]   if you're a new registrant.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:34.860]   You've got to use the promo code TWITSTOCK, or visit iStockPhoto.com/TwitStock
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.780]   for more information.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.500]   I think it's a great place to find images, to upload your images.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.380]   If you don't know about it yet, take a look at iStockPhoto.com/TwitStock.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.460]   We do thank them so much for their support of our Mac World
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.260]   coverage all this week, both on Mac to break weekly end.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:50.700]   Woo hoo!
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.200]   Yes.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.460]   Was that a slasher or is it TwitStock just the code?
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.260]   The code is TwitStock, but you can do/TwitStock.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.260]   Both will work.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   Both will work.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   Both will work.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.260]   Both will work.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.260]   It's magical.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.820]   Well, you know, Devorak never showed up.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.820]   I don't know what he's--
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820]   I'm here, Leo.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.820]   What are you talking about?
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   I just saw him outside.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   Did you?
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.820]   Are we done yet?
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.820]   Of course, in the street.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.820]   Really?
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   Let's get some real content going.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   He's hiding from us.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.820]   That's what he is.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.820]   He's probably getting his personal where we want.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.860]   I think he's actually can't find us.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.940]   Many people don't understand this with that, John, but you know, he's wandering somewhere.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.940]   I can't find.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.460]   I will get an email from him saying, "I couldn't find you.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.460]   I looked everywhere.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.460]   Where were you?
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.460]   I can't find you."
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.460]   I got bored.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   I went out.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.460]   I guarantee you.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.460]   I went to the deli.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.460]   I guarantee you.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.460]   That's exactly what happened.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   We're sorry.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   We missed him.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.260]   And I know you're sorry you missed him because it's fun to make fun of, John, but we did.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.140]   It was really great to have Patrick Norton here.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.140]   What's the name of that blog again?
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   Devorak.com/blogblogblogblog.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   Yeah, let's give him a plug.
