[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.300]   I'm still at AOL.

[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.700]   You moved to San Francisco and I'm just in, you know, still
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.100]   there and figuring out what I might do next.

[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.200]   Fair enough.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.800]   We'll leave that cliffhanger.

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   It's like all these names coming back all the names that has
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.000]   now destroyed and killed.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.600]   All these have been a plugged.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.700]   But and what are you doing now, Christina?
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.200]   I mean, obviously your film girl on Twitter.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.800]   We know that.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.900]   I'm seeing your tech correspondent at Mashable where I've
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.400]   been for gosh, almost six years.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   Incredible.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.600]   And Mashable is huge.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000]   How many were tens of millions now uniques?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.300]   Oh, God, like 40 something.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   I'm kind of.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.800]   No, when I joined, there were nine people total in the company.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000]   And now I think there are like two hundred and three of us two hundred and three.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.100]   Huge.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.400]   Also on the Skype, Owen Stone is with us also known as Oh, doctor.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.800]   Welcome back to the program.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.900]   Uncle Jason.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   I don't know who let you run the ship, but obviously the inmates are running the house today.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.200]   Yes.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.300]   So we're going to see what happens.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.600]   The inmates are running the asylum and you're wearing your headphones that make you look like.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.400]   The guy from the Empire Strikes Back who worked for Lando Carrician.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.900]   What was that guy's name?
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.800]   You're the guy I'm talking about.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   You were in Orlando, guys.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.000]   You had the big white ears.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.100]   You'd like to.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.500]   There you go.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.300]   All right.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.800]   Listen, it's been a crazy weekend.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.300]   Things are going nuts on the interwebs about Reddit.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.000]   I don't know if everybody's following this story.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.200]   I'm assuming they're melting down.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.100]   It is a complete and utter meltdown.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.600]   They fired.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.500]   The woman who was running in Victoria Victoria.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.100]   Victoria.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.900]   She was incredibly well loved by the admins, the community managers.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   Who were running all the subreddits.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.300]   They fired her, the people who run the subreddits, as I understand it, decided they would shut down in protest all the subreddits yesterday.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   Yeah, there was something like 130 or so that it got shut down.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.400]   I think over the course of the test.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   Which is the equivalent of a factory shutdown.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.800]   It's like that.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.200]   It's a strike.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   It's literally the site went on strike.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:53.100]   And then I go to the homepage and the homepage is literally, I don't know if there's 15 stories on the Reddit homepage, but 14 of them are brutally attacking.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.800]   Ellen Powell, the CEO, interim CEO, Key Point.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.400]   And some of them pretty horrible misogynistic, racist, horrible stuff.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.100]   But let's just call it what it is.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.700]   The whole place is melting down.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.100]   Peter, what are your thoughts on this and why it's happened?
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.500]   Well, it's, I mean, I think that there has been a lot of people.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.900]   A lot of frustration on the part of the mods and people, I mean, I think people who are familiar with Reddit understand that the mods are basically unpaid volunteers.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.400]   Right.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.500]   Who do a lot of administrative and work and heavy lifting for the site.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so they, they, they organize each of these individual channels.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They keep them clean.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   They moderate them, remove spam and do a lot of stuff that, you know, you couldn't operate Reddit if you had to pay this army of people.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.700]   Right.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.300]   To, to do all this work.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.200]   And so a lot of them have been frustrated with the way that Reddit has been run.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:52.000]   There's been a lot of, there's been a lack of communication, I think from the executive team there, from the management team at Reddit to these mods.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:06.600]   And I think what happened was when they brought in Victoria, I think, which was a couple of years ago, it was actually to help, you know, facilitate better communication from the management to the, the mods of the sub-redits and really help improve the experience for them.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.300]   And that seems to have worked because people actually loved her.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.600]   People were happy that the AMAs were, because what happened was the AMAs were blowing up and asked me anything featured.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   And they were, it was becoming kind of like a, like a wild west where, you know, celebrities were being impersonated and, and they needed to have some, they needed to have a little bit more control.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.700]   And so they brought in Victoria to help organize that.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.500]   And I think getting rid of her and not communicating why we still don't know why she left, why she was.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.200]   Right.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.400]   And the rumors, I guess, people are going a little bit wild speculating that they were trying to commercialize the AMAs.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.700]   They obviously came out with an AMA app at some point.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.900]   And that maybe she was filibustering the commercialization of it.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.000]   Christina or, or doctor, what are your, either of your takes on this and why was she fired?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.900]   Does anybody know yet?
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.300]   I don't know.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.900]   So just close your, I know Victoria.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.100]   I knew her before she joined Reddit when she was at ID, which is a, you know, the big talent agency and she actually did a lot of AMAs on behalf of clients at ID.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.300]   And I think that's how she met the Reddit people.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   I saw her on Monday, you know, when she was still at Reddit.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.900]   She came into her office to give a presentation on Reddit.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:19.000]   You know, I haven't talked to her, but I had other, other, to express my support and tell her, you know, that I'm rooting for her and whatnot.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.600]   But no, I mean, you know, like Peter said, the community loved her.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.500]   She was truly like somebody who it wasn't just a job.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.000]   Like she was a legit like, got the community spirit.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.800]   Like it wasn't one of those things.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   No idea this was coming.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.900]   It wasn't like there was no indication when you saw her on Monday that that something was a miss.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.400]   No, no, not at all.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000]   And she's been working there for two years, Christina.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.000]   Get to us.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.100]   What percentage of the site would you estimate she actually runs and is responsible for if we were to think about it?
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.200]   Because you have this management team that's keeping the servers up and maybe trying to make an ad business on top of Reddit.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.600]   But then there's the community side.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.100]   Is there like a whole community team at Reddit that's taking care of the community or was she running all the mods and then the mods are taking care of the site?
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.400]   Well, she was basically in charge of the AMA section, the IAMA section.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.900]   She was kind of the liaison between the community and some of the admins.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:19.300]   And so if you look at Reddit and you look at like what the part is that gets the most public press that's positive, that's not about the terrible misogynistic awful hatred, like the fapping type of stuff, like the stuff that makes us embarrassed to be denizens of the internet.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.400]   The good stuff from Reddit usually comes from the AMA's and that was all stuff that she helped coordinate.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:32.100]   So she would usually not always but oftentimes sit side by side with a lot of the celebrities and type their answers because she can type really fast.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.300]   You know, she would do a lot to verify to make to get with their management to get with it.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:49.400]   The, you know, whoever was doing the AMA to verify them to the community, she would take back kind of act as a liaison between, you know, the moderators and the regular, you know, and the staff at Reddit.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.100]   You know, she was one of the few people still in New York, but from what I understand it didn't seem like, you know, that was going to have to change.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.800]   I don't think it was the moving to New York or moving to San Francisco part that had anything to do with it.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.700]   I think that core thread that seems the most likely to me.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.700]   I can't really.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   It seemed to take totally take her by surprise.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.400]   And when I saw her on Monday, you know, she there was absolutely no indication that anything was happening.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.800]   So, I mean, she was she was in her office on behalf of Reddit.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.700]   So it was it was a total shock, I think, to kind of all of us.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.800]   But she one thing I was like stressed about her is that she's like a legit person like who got the community.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:38.100]   You know, there's some people who act in kind of community manager roles and kind of liaison roles between users and community people and, you know, the staff from social networks who kind of don't get the ecosystem.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:48.700]   She legit got it and was, you know, somebody who used Reddit before she joined and got it was part of kind of that's why she was so loved because she could speak their language.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.200]   She actually did the work to get to know the community, which completely, you know, it's it's very hard to build a community at this scale.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.000]   And it's very easy to to break it, obviously, as you've seen, oh, doctor, what's your take on all this?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.800]   Just in general, pure speculation, it just seems so out of the blue that someone went into a meeting and was trying to tell her something and she was trying to explain how it actually works.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.400]   And somebody had a knee jerk reaction.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:23.800]   Well, if you're not on board, then you're out because how can you just annex someone that is so beloved and so ingrained in your system out of the blue like that and then not have any kind of response.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.100]   No kind of gesture, no peaceful parting ways like don't you know somebody in PR or anything like you just set a wave on a on a small island and you just let everything get wiped out.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.900]   You don't send any kind of recovery, no water, no nothing.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.100]   You just let it all wipe away.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.600]   So it's just completely quiet.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.800]   So this somebody I think it's a childish move.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.600]   This is a very good point, which is the right of man.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.100]   Yeah, they should have been ahead of.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.700]   I mean, you should understand that you can't make a change like that.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.200]   You can't change a public facing part of your business like that without having a plan for how you communicate that to the community.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.500]   Right.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.400]   I mean, it just it doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   Okay.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.100]   So I want to ask the question that's not very politically correct.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.800]   I don't think and it's pretty controversial, which is why is Ellen Powell running this site?
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.500]   She's never been CEO of a company.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.800]   I think at this point, this is her first job as CEO.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   And if you were going to think about who the worst person you could match with this community would be.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.700]   I think you would be hard pressed to find another executive in Silicon Valley who would be the antithesis of what this community would want in a leader.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.700]   She's quiet.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:41.900]   She's I guess in the bucket that most people would say social justice warrior and then you have this other contingent that's incredibly loud on Reddit, which is provocative, pushing the line of free speech, pushing the lines of offensiveness.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.700]   How much of this is Ellen Powell's fault because she's not qualified.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   How much of it is she's getting beat up and she shouldn't be beat up.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.300]   I mean, this is the topic.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   I think that is the key here is a community ever going to accept Ellen Powell.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.400]   Well, I think in general, for somebody smarter says something for me.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.200]   The things you said, the contrast is also a business decision.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.100]   You can't say you have a group of.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.000]   Animals and you're going to let another animal run that business.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.700]   You would want someone structured and someone a little bit removed from that environment to try and get it stable and have some kind of.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.700]   Structure to it.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.900]   That's not the I could say in her defense to what she just asked a question.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.800]   Yeah, and I'm not what I'm trying to get at is is she the right person for the job.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.700]   I think most people I think very few people are the right person for that job.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.300]   So I don't think it's necessarily a failing of Ellen Powell.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.700]   Right.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:47.100]   It's just that I think very few people have that innate understanding of communities and that's why most communities like this that grow and it tends to be the founder.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.100]   Right.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:57.800]   Who has been there since the first since the distance day one who has nurtured it and and stuck with the community and kind of knows it in and out who usually is able to get it through times like this.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:04.000]   And I know Alexis who's one of the co-founders and he's working there now and he's back there now.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I know that he did kind of piss some people off with some some kind of flippant comments, but it doesn't seem like he's trying to, you know, take the trust that the community has in him as the founder and somebody's been there since the beginning to kind of help them get through this.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   I mean, I will say, you know, I think that the fact that there is I mean, there is a misogyny problem on Reddit for sure amongst other problems.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:31.000]   Well, I mean, so I think having someone who is outspoken as a feminist, maybe a good thing for a community like that.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.500]   Okay.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:45.000]   But, you know, I think that there are very, very, very few people, like I said earlier, who have the qualities to be able to manage a community of this size that is very unruly and that it's not just that they don't just want one thing.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It's a lot of different things and different communities that all may want different things and to kind of make all those people happy is very, very, very hard.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Christina, where your thoughts on Ellen Powell and the job she's done as the interim CEO.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You know, I mean, honestly, I mean, I think that the Reddit's whole kind of management structure has been kind of, you know, a cluster of rock, you know, kind of for quite some time.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I mean, I don't think Yashan did a great job and I think that when things started to kind of get really, you know, publicly look really bad.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I think that his response was bad.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I mean, I don't think that she, I think that her, you know, her status as an investor, I don't think necessarily qualifies or unqualifies her.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I don't know how good of a cultural fit she is with Reddit.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I didn't, I don't get the sense that she's really somebody who's part of the community.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I don't think that her being a woman or being, you know, Ellen Powell, again, disqualifies her.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   What I will say is I was bothered by kind of an interview she gave to my guys like at the New York Times when this happened where she kind of was kind of flipping and said, you know, the majority of the community doesn't care about these blacked out subreddits.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   They don't, they don't care about Victoria.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And saying that, I mean, she should have just covered a mouse chat and not said anything about Victoria at all.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Just, just, you know, stayed out of it and just said, we're trying to, you know, respond to the community and, and, you know, do what we can to get things running again, rather than being so flip about all.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Well, you know, the vast majority of the people who come to the site don't care about this because to me, that's just it's completely, I guess, proving that she's not connected to the community, which to me just kind of leads me to think she's not a great cultural fit.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Yeah, that's what I, the sense I get is she does not have any interest in being part of that community.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's a job to manage it. But if you're not in that community, you kind of have to be participating.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   You have to be a participant. It's the same way that, that if you want to be the CEO of Twitter, you probably should be active on Twitter.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Right. Yeah. If you want to run Gmail, it'd be good if you use Gmail.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Right. Yeah. And, and, and I think that, you know, we've seen communities revolt before, and we saw dig, right?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   The dig community. Yeah.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And that was six, seven years ago.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I mean, it was really the reason I think Reddit made it to the next level.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Everybody went to Reddit.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   That is. And it's, you know, and it's funny to see that there are a few kind of Reddit clones that are, I think, trying to vote, or something.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Vote, or something.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Vote, I think, is one of them.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Take advantage of the situation.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah. But was it you that said, I mean, how even, I mean, should, you know, should something like Reddit even be a for-profit centralized enterprise?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Maybe it should be like a decentralized protocol that just organizes communities and people.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Well, I mean, it is, it does seem to me that the game of Reddit is to see how far you can push the envelope and how non-corporate you can be.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And I think Steve Huffman and Alexis both understood that.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Yeah. And they kind of let the community push the boundaries and said, yeah, we, we understand that this last five percent over here.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   The majority of us don't like, but it is free speech. Yeah.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And so if you want to talk about dead babies, it's pretty horrific, but comedians make jokes about those things.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And ambulance, you know, people, you know, have to deal with babies dying.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And there's a place in the world for people to talk about this horrific subject.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   But they just recently went, I don't know, a month ago and started getting rid of certain subreddits that had to do with hate.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Yeah, they banned a few, like I hate fat people.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Again, and I'm a fat person and I got a problem with that.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I mean, the other day, everybody lately just needs to like take a breath and make fun of their mom or something because everybody is so in-saupt.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   So insane about this is a fens me, that a fens me like everything's offensive to somebody.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   But again, we live in a country where you're allowed to say things, you know, and my personal response to that is like all this, um, the hate against gay marriage and all that stuff.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I'm like, look, don't quiet those voices.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I want to see the snakes in my grass.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   If you quiet up all these people and push them in the closet, you just let the gay people out of, they're like, road to, they're going to be all infrastructure in my house.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And I'm not going to see them coming when everything falls apart.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   They shine light on them.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yes.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Say where they are.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Yes.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And if you don't like what somebody's saying, there's all kinds of buttons to mute, to not see, to hide, to whatever you want to do.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   As long as you're not talking about physically coming to someone's house and hurting someone, you should be able to say whatever you want to say and deleting something and deleting the, the, a core of your business is a slippery slope because when do you stop?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Because everything's offensive to somebody.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Where do we stop?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I think that there's also, though, that, um, you know, when, you know, you build a community like this and I'm someone who's built communities in the past, is that if you let them become over with spam or abusiveness or a corrosive kind of dialogue, it drives out people that have insightful, useful contributions to make.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And I think the thing about Reddit is, and they've done a great job of, I guess, up until this point, being a place where, yeah, in the margins, there's some terrible stuff.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Right.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   But a lot of really great things get generated every day.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And there's a lot of very thoughtful people that contribute either links or comments or whatever, you know, to that platform, to that site.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And I think that, you know, if, if you don't have some level, you have to draw lines somewhere.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And I think it's, I think you want to, you know, be as open to free speech and being open to free speech means being open to offensive speech.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   But you also don't want it to be a place that just becomes a haven for, you know, bullying or, I mean, Twitter is facing this problem. Facebook has faced this problem.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Christina, what are your thoughts on the fringe of Reddit?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   How would you handle it?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   How has the current management team, Alan Powell, handled it?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Have they handled it well?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   How much of the issue do you think is just a mismatch of Alan Powell to this community?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And can you actually put rails on a community like Reddit without destroying it?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I mean, that's, I think the key here.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Can we put rails on Reddit, Christina?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   No, I don't know if we can.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I mean, I think that the doc actually kind of mentioned something interesting.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   He said something about, you know, when you have kind of a business of doing stuff, I think that what made has made Reddit, what, the reason all these problems are happening is that it started out as this site, you know, that, that was getting kind of a following and that Conde paid, what, like, 15 million for something.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And they were kind of maintaining on a shoestring budget and then they got bigger and bigger and bigger and all of a sudden it started getting real traffic becoming one of the most visited sites in the world becoming a real place where you could conceivably make real money off of it.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And at that point, all of a sudden everybody starts paying attention and we start, they start taking external financing and advance starts realizing, hey, this thing that we bought and kind of ignored could have the potential to be a real cash cow because it's getting so much real traffic.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And so when it becomes a business, the paradigm changes, right? So you could before when it's just kind of, you know, say, la v, you can talk about it being kind of a free speech haven place with for good and for ill and I'm personally a believer in free speech, even when that means,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   especially when it means, you know, awful speech, you know, that's the stuff you need to protect the most.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But at the same time, there's some, there's a way to balance, I think, speech and also making a community that people actually want to be a part of.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I think the challenge with Reddit is taking what had been a pretty freewheeling community and one that we see in this instance where literally the users were having been able to kind of shut the site down because they're able to take it private, whereas the people who run the site who own the site,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   the actual employees can't do anything to get it up again.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   When that can happen, I think that kind of shows how ill prepared this company is, we're dealing with the realities of having this really kind of weird French community that is also happens to be a huge hub of traffic.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And so they want to profit off of it, but they don't really know how to harness in the community that is built up around it primarily because it was kind of where anything could go.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I don't have the answer to that, but I don't think what they're doing is the right way to do it, especially with the messaging.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I think that it's one thing that they said, look, we're not banning you from talking about these topics.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   The reason we ban these communities is because the people in them started to harass individuals and go after them in their real life.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And that becomes a problem. And that's why they're shutting them down.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I think if you explain things that way, rather than kind of, oh, we've got this anti-harassment policy and this other stuff, that's when people start to go, wait a minute.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It's great for everybody to be nice to one another, but this is the internet and this is Reddit.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   And part of the deal is that people say terrible hateful things.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And this is the same company that a couple of years ago was defending some of the upshot communities and saying, we're not going to delete this stuff.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And because it's not illegal, even though it's disrespectful.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   So I don't know.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Yeah, it's complicated, obviously. When we get back, I want to talk about, if you think, I'm going to ask each of our panelists, if Ellen Powell is going to make it out of the summer as the CEO of Reddit or not, the line between free speech and hate speech.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And then are you going to pay for iTunes, radio, music, or not? Yes or no?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   When we get back, after these messages, about an amazing company, which I use all the time called Wealthfront, I'm also an investor. Let's hand it off to Leo for the commercial.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   We'll get back to this. We can take it a bit. I have returned to speak to you about, this is the first time we've ever had a sponsor that I'm not allowed to use the product. Thanks to SEC regulations.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I'm talking about Wealthfront. This is really interesting, especially for us Geeks, way to invest your money using really well proven philosophies that I actually have known about for more than 10 years and believe in.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But they do it automatically. It's automated with software and it's really clever. Well, I want you to hear about this. Wealthfront, W-E-A-L-T-H-F-R-O-N-T.com. Wealthfront.com.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And if you go to Wealthfront.com/tuit, we'll get a special deal. I'll explain that in a second.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   So, normally when you're investing, you get an investment advisor and they're going to charge you a fee. And that fee could be 1%. I think my mom's investment advisor, she was giving her a good deal 1%. But it could be 2%. What do you pay? And if you have an investment advisor, 3%.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It could be very expensive and that's not including any transaction fees, changes, things like that. It can really add up and eat away at your investment. Wealthfront is going to give anyone, anyone who wants it, access to world class, long term investment manager.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   In fact, I know some of you are like day traders. You do investing for fun. It's like a game for you. That's not what this is. This is long term growth of your nest egg, whether you're saving for retirement or maybe I want to say for a boat. So I could say for a house.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   This is what this is for. Long term investments. And they do so many very clever things. Now, if you go to Wealthfront.com, you can actually get started at no cost and just see what their portfolio would be for you.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   So that's very helpful to get an idea of what they're talking about. And that you can do right now at Wealthfront.com/tuit.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   This is commission-free. And let me tell you, it's done in software. Very clever idea. They're using investment strategies that have been around for a long time. Investment strategies I've used.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   But because the software is monitoring it, even with Interday all the time, they can do things like maximize your tax savings. They do something that's inter-day trading called tax loss,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   or financing, direct indexing. Even if you're somebody who's trading actively for your own account, just for fun or for profit, this is a great solution to put your money away, not worry about it.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   It's automatically managed at a very low cost, 25 basis points. That's right. 25 basis points. That's one quarter of 1% a year. Remember I said these other guys charging 1, 2, 3%.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And one quarter of 1% per year. And there are no commissions, no hidden fees, no additional charges for any of the services you get from Wealthfront.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   This is really smart. This was created by some really smart guys who said, "You can do this strategy very effectively using software and produce very reliable results.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Do the tax loss harvesting, which is kind of hard to do unless you're using software, and really benefit people by a huge amount. It's no surprise they are now managing $2.4 billion in client assets that's grown over 20 times in the last two years.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   They're just exploding right now. And because of SEC rules, it turns out if you're doing this, you can't use client testimonials and your ads. I can't sign up. It's killing me.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But you can. For compliance purposes, I have to tell you Wealthfront Incorporated is an SEC registered investment advisor. Brokeridge services are offered through Wealthfront Brokeridge Corporation, Member FINRA and SIPC.

[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Let's hear it for Wealthfront, another great product that I was able to invest in. Awesome. Great ad.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   When we left, Christina, you're making some very good points about... I think we all believe in free speech, even if we don't like it.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Even if it's disgusting, even if we hate it. But there's a difference between... No business is obligated to give anyone a platform to say anything.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   So if they hate fat people, that's subreddit. They're not obligated to maintain it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But is there a way to maintain Reddit and not allow that at this point?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   That's what Reddit is. You can't stop doing what is your business model. You can't McDonald's turning to Chick-fil-A overnight because they sell burgers.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   That's... It just irks me so bad. You shouldn't be allowed to talk about killing people or threatening someone who's live or showing up at their home.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.040]   Everything else, as far as
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   Yes.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   Whether it's drunk babies or kicking dogs down the street, that's what floats your boat.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:21.000]   The problem is they don't understand what their business actually is, so they have no clue how to monetize it or how to wrangle it or control it because they really don't understand what it is.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   You can't silence something that makes you money. You tell everybody to shut up. Where's the money coming from and you're not a make yet?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And then how does... Is Reddit making money now?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   That's very little.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   They're making very little from what I understand.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Given the scale of the site, they make relatively little money.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   They've got over 100 million uniques.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I think it's like in the mid-hundred...
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Yeah, 150 or something.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Here's one of the things. I give some information. I've been getting pinged by a lot of employees who have left because they think that some of the projects I'm working on might be good places to land.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   They're telling me that nobody will go work there.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That they've set all the salaries at the same rate, so you can't negotiate your salary.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So great people who want to go there who make slightly more than whatever they set the specific salary at are disqualified.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   That was Allen's policy, I remember.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Which is the stupidest policy I've ever heard.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Has there ever been a stupider policy than no negotiations for salary?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I don't want to make this because people are going to be beating up on Allen Powell.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   But she is the first time CEO and this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Christina, what do you think of this?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Are people allowed to negotiate their salaries or is it not allowed?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Yeah, no, people are definitely allowed. I've definitely negotiated mine.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   No, I mean, I think they're--
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   But you're a woman. I thought you were incapable of negotiating your salary.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Right. Yeah, no.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   I know.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Seriously, that's Allen Powell's position is that women don't negotiate as well.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Well, no, I don't say that.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Therefore, we should take away the negotiation of salaries. It sounds completely stupid.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Right. Which sort of bothered me?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I understand sort of where she's coming from saying that women historically are less comfortable negotiating their salaries.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And so to make, I guess, the playing field more even, there's just no negotiation.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Instead, I think the better response is let's teach women how to negotiate their salaries.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   If you're a woman and you need help, you need advice like how to negotiate your salary, like call me, like film girl.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Like call me Allen's winner. I've helped plenty of younger colleagues, men and women, but especially women with that.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So yeah, I mean, I think the real thing is like teach women how to negotiate.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Don't get rid of negotiating period because like you said, you end up getting, ruling out a ton of people who will be great in the job.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And then you end up making, you know, it's an unpleasant experience if you're coming into a new job and you don't have any room to negotiate.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   It's like, okay, so I'm going to take a pay cut or I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And let's just end this by just, is she going to make it out of the, let's just say the year?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Will Allen Powell be the CEO come January 1st, 2016? Oh, doctor? Yes or no?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I don't think so.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   That's a no. Christina? Will Allen Powell be the CEO? No, definitely not.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Peter? Well, she's interim CEO now. Right.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   So it actually will be relatively easy for the board to bring in a full-time CEO and say we've invented our search and we found a full-time permanent CEO.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Right.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   So I think that, I think that she will, I'd be surprised if they offered her the opportunity to transition to being a permanent CEO.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And the correct answer is she will not make it out of the year.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I cannot tell you exactly how I know this, but I am certain of it.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Let's move over to, and just, you know, I think as much as the board is going to not allow her to, and this gets into sort of corporate governess, not allow her to continue,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   was this a bad decision to put her in charge of this to begin with, Peter? I start to wonder like first-time CEO and you said before this is the hardest job you can imagine.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And what's the harder job than this? Blackberry or AOL?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Ha! Or Reddit, which is the hardest, which company would be the hardest one to run for you, Peter?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Which one would you, in order, would you take those jobs?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I would actually take the Blackberry job first.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I would too, okay.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Because then which one would we take second AOL?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   AOL?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Five years ago, AOL or Reddit?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Which one would be nice?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I would have screwed up AOL really badly, but...
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Sounds like Reddit?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Maybe Reddit and then AOL.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Interesting.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Okay, so let's go on to the iTunes Music Radio with the new release of 8.4.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Obviously Beats 1, they've got the new app.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Apple Music.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Apple Music.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Apple Music.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And here's the thing I'm kind of embarrassed about.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   It took me no less than three or four minutes to find it.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I was like, where is it?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I downloaded the new updates.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I get on my desktop and they're telling me, oh my God, you have it.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Where is it?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And how do you find it?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I might the only person who had this experience of feeling really stupid that I was looking
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   for the Apple radio icon on my desktop.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And searching in iTunes trying to find it, how long did it take you to find it, Peter?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Well, if anything is actually, I looked for it in the App Store.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Because I thought like, I need to...
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Oh, I did Apple Radio.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Yeah, well, Apple Music.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Apple Music.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I need to install this.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And of course, that was not the right thing.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Not the right answer.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You have to go to your Music app, which is your iTunes app, and then you find it there.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Yes.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   There's a separate iTunes app.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   iTunes is still where you buy your...
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Well, there's a music app and there's an iTunes app.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So there's two separate things.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Right.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So what's the difference for Stina between the iTunes app?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I thought that actually they would do a separate app.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   A third mu...
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Because it's the podcast they have too, which is awesome.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Yes.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I don't think Apple cares about how many apps they force on us.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Where is it?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Well, they...
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Where can people find it?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And how long do they take you to find it?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Okay, so disclosure.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Apple showed it to me on Monday.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Right.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   So they walked me through it.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Right.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   They showed you where to find it.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Yeah, they showed me where to find it.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   They showed me the new white icon, which I hate.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   No, I mean, it's the old music icon.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   It used to be orangeish and now it's white.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.480]   And there's the iTunes Store, which still is where you buy your stuff and download your
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   tracks.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.320]   But that's different from all of your music, it's where your radio stuff is.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   That's all in one app.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.520]   And then your podcast is still a separate app too.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.360]   But on the desktop, it's still one app, iTunes, which is a bloated mess.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   Even more.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   But they've crammed even more into iTunes on the desktop, which is amazing to me.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.840]   I am so confused by it.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.920]   But I did like it because the Beats One radio station was actually pretty cool.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.240]   Like they had some good programming.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.720]   I mean, I think they're being adventurous in the programming.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.640]   So I have to say, I was listening for about 35 seconds before they played that for a new
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.080]   Pharrell song, which I think they're contractually obliged to play.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   Oh, really?
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   Have you noticed this?
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   They're actually...
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   They have to be doing it all the time.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.560]   They're contractually obliged to play it all the time.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   Not a happy song, but it's...
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   No, the new one.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.640]   Oh, he's got a new summer ballot.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   I don't know where.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   It's like they did some Theal where it was like...
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   Oh, good.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   I haven't.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   He gave it to him exclusive and then they had to play it all the time.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   Okay, Doctor, what do you think of it?
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   I heard it one time.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   Just let me rant real quick because...
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   Okay, rant away.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.400]   That's why you're here.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.920]   The radio, Beastman radio, is really awesome.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.960]   It's like a thousand times better than paying for Pandora.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.000]   The selection, the fact that they bring in all kinds of crazy music, they've gotten me
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   to buy four songs.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.200]   I haven't bought music from iTunes in like three years, but they got me to buy like four
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.120]   singles because they just put this crazy stuff on my playlist.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   That's awesome.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:27.240]   The quality, though, is about 50% the quality streaming that Pandora is.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.920]   And how do I know this?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.200]   Because I have a concert in my car.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.320]   I have 3,000 watts in my car and I'll be bumping.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.360]   And when I listen to Pandora, I can't sit in my seat in my backers.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.560]   I'm listening to this and I'm trying to blow out the button, turn up the volume because
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.840]   it's just not really good quality.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.280]   Then on top of the fact that you put all this junk in my face and you hit away my 400
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   gigs of music.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   I got like 30,000 albums.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   I got so much music.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.600]   And all my music is over here on this one little tab.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.480]   Once I get there, I got to flip through to four things you want to slip the top before
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   I can get to school.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   And then you're going to get my little place on top here.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.080]   But you got this new crap, which I don't care about.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.440]   You got the heart, which again, I don't care about.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   What is the heart?
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   The heart is what they think you like?
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   What you're learning.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   They're good.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.880]   Yeah, that's the music.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.640]   That's Apple music, which when I use that, I'd rather stick to Spotify over this.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.080]   I don't really know what this is.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.640]   Beats one, the music selection, stuff that comes up, they nailed that.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.040]   All the rest of this crap could be set on fire right now.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.520]   And you can get beats one free.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.840]   You don't have to pay for beats one.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   Ah, you can get that without paying the $10 a month for Apple music.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.400]   So when you pay the $10 a month, you're paying for it to be clear, not just a Pandora-like
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.920]   experience of fast forwarding, but you can play entire albums if I was listening.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.920]   It's like Spotify.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.240]   It's a lot of demand access to whatever, like the, I don't know how big the cat.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.200]   Christina, do you know how large the library is?
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   30 million.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   30 million.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.520]   So is the library any different between Spotify and?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   Yes.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.320]   There are some differences, but it's very, very similar.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   So on the fringe.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.400]   The fringe stuff is where, like for instance, I'm a nerd and I like collegiate acapella.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.080]   There's more of that stuff on Spotify than on Beats.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.040]   I'm sorry, what did she just say?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.680]   She said acapella something.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.200]   I said collegiate acapella because I'm not just regular acapella, but collegiate.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   No, collegiate acapella.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   Just what language?
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   I know what a acapella is.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   What is collegiate?
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   It's like college, college, like college groups.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   Okay.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.840]   But not graduate school or just an include grad school?
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   I can't.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, high school.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.760]   You can use include high school, I guess.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   And most of them.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.800]   The school kids, they're not at the level of the actual level of.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   We're cutting to it right now.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.000]   Yeah, we're talking the pitch perfect type of stuff.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   They're talking about glee.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I got you.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I got you.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   So, yeah, that's fine.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.960]   Like I said, I have good taste of music too, but there's some of the rare stuff, I guess,
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.600]   some of the, a lot of EDM stuff and certain indie stuff, certain like, as like, Euro stuff
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.200]   is on Spotify more.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.680]   There's some more mainstream stuff on Apple music.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.400]   We did find out in our testing, weirdly, Ace of Base, or Ace of Base.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   Yes, of course.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   Ace of Base.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   They are not on Apple music.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   Well, that's, that makes my decision easy.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   But they're Swedish.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.520]   So, they have to root for the home team.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   That's what I said.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   They're on the Spotify Swedish.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   Okay.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   Exactly.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   That's what I thought.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.440]   So, if you want to listen to the sign, you have to do Spotify.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.560]   But if you want to listen to New Taylor Swift album or the chronic and some other stuff,
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   you know, Apple music has it.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   They're very, very similar.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.880]   The catalogs, I would say, are probably 98% the same.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.480]   How many people here on the panel actually pay one of these music services every month?
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   I pay Rhapsody.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   That's it.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   I do.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   I pay Spotify.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   You pay Spotify.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   What do you pay?
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   I paid Spotify.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   I paid Pandora.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   I paid Pandora.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   I don't need more.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   Where it's coming from.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   And, Christina, which one do you pay for?
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   I pay for Spotify.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   Right.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:57.240]   So, this is going to be paying for a subscription has replaced buying CDs clearly, right?
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   Amongst the panelists you have.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   That's for me.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   You don't buy CDs.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.680]   I pay for a lot of media.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.480]   You don't want to know how much I spend a month on media.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   Hold on a second.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   I don't even talk about social services.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   Why would you pay for a CD if you paid for Spotify?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.920]   Oh, oh, it's a Capella.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.840]   Or it might not be on Spotify.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.360]   Or I really like the band.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   And I want to support them.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   And so, I want to have it just in case it gets removed from the streaming catalog because
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   I don't trust.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   Just what's happened.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   Just what's happened.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   Catalog got to do something.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   Casey Point, Tom York hates Spotify.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.800]   He is on Apple Music, however.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.720]   So, if I wanted to listen to Tom York, I would need to have his albums and iTunes.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.920]   Now he's in Apple Music, so that will be fine.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.800]   So, is every adult, because right now I think Spotify is at 20 million paid?
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   Right.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   About 20 million paid.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.280]   Which, to me, is extraordinary at eight bucks a pop.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.720]   It's actually, no, it's 10 bucks a month.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   10 bucks a month.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.920]   They're making $2.4 billion a year now.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   This is the new--
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   Yeah, there was money though.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   I mean, what's that?
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.800]   Yeah, the Spotify is not profitable.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   Right.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.920]   Because they have to give 70 cents on the dollar, 80 cents on the--
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.920]   70--
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   Just over 70 cents to that.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.580]   And that's still not paying what someone would-- like, this whole streaming music thing is
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.640]   kind of destroying the music business in general.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.120]   Not that that's always been a sham.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.800]   But right now, it's like, oh, well, they're kind of running my music and they're sort
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.120]   of paying me for it.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.920]   But if you're on the mid to lower level, you're getting screwed.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   You're not getting anything.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.600]   And so Spotify making however much money they're making, they still don't make any
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.600]   money.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.200]   And I personally, I own most of my own music, and that's one of the things I actually spend
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   money on.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   Right.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   But I prefer to have it.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   But they're not making money.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.960]   Like, how long is this pyramid going to exist?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:41.000]   Like, Pandora is like on pins and needles begging for extensions to keep their boat afloat.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.480]   And they're playing, I'm happy, 42 billion times an hour, and Pharrell gets 32 cents a
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   year.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.720]   Like, it's really a scam system.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   And all the cards are going to fall, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   All right.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.480]   When we get back from this commercial break, I want to know what's the future of these
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   services?
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.800]   Is the music industry going to shut them all down?
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.840]   Which one should we buy?
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.520]   And what impact iTunes music is going to make on Spotify?
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.400]   Is this going to validate the category?
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.120]   Or is it going to cut into their 20 million subscribers when we get back?
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   And after this amazing message from our good pal, Leo LaPorte.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.400]   It's time to talk about my mattress.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.720]   Hi, everybody.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.080]   Leo LaPorte here jumping in, barging in.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   We're going to get back to the show in just a second.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.240]   But I want to tell you about Casper.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:30.120]   They're amazing mattresses made in the US premium quality for a fraction of the cost.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.720]   Mattresses that are so great that I use them.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.880]   I sent one to my son.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.960]   My daughter's going to get one in the fall when she goes back to school.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   They come in a box.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.040]   First of all, this mattress is a lot smaller in the box than it's going to be when you
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   open it up.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.200]   That makes it really easy to get into an apartment, to get up the stairs, to get into
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.760]   your guest room.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   That was a huge deal.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   You see here, our mattress, they give you a tool, you open it up.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   It goes, "Whew!"
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.200]   And then you get the most amazing mattress you have ever tried.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.120]   Soft, comfortable, but firm.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.800]   It's subtly firm.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.000]   I don't know how to describe this.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.560]   It has just the right sink and bounce.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.840]   It feels good on your back, but your hips aren't getting bruised by the firm.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.640]   I can't describe it, but you've got to try it.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.000]   One of the things I love about Casper is they do let you try it.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.480]   For a hundred nights, this blows me away.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.840]   I think they had to do this because frankly, people are saying, "Well, I want to try a
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.440]   mattress before I buy it."
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.400]   We all know, and I've done this and I've been very unhappy with the results.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.680]   We've all gone to a mattress store, lion a mattress.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Is that good?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.440]   It's completely unlike sleeping on one.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.200]   You're there for a couple of minutes with a sales lady staring at you, giving you this
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.720]   stink eye.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.000]   That's no way to try a mattress.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.400]   This is so much better.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   Casper will deliver it free.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.880]   You sleep on it for as many as a hundred nights.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.840]   If you don't like it, they'll take it back.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.400]   No cost to you.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.640]   Shipping free everything.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:07.400]   You have a hundred day guarantee, which is unbelievable.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.440]   This is such a great mattress.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.240]   They start at $500 for a twin.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.200]   They're easy for a student, for somebody getting started, or somebody who's just not happy
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.040]   with their mattress.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.880]   This is a great mattress.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.200]   We've sold so many of them now.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.880]   I've heard for so many of you who say you love your Casper's.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:30.640]   Try it out at Casper.com/twit and to the promo code TWIT and you're going to get $50 off.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.560]   That makes it even better.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   Casper.com/twit.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:41.960]   Use the offer code TWIT to save $50 on your new mattress, your favorite mattress ever,
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   Casper.com/twit.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.360]   Thank you for their support of this weekend tech.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   Now back to the news.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.720]   I'm going to get one of those Casper mattresses.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:57.360]   I'm going to log into Wealthfront and I'm just going to set my risk profile.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   They got their money's worth in that ad.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.320]   I would watch that again.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.720]   The ad was hilarious.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.120]   I like these in the field ads of Leo rolling around.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.160]   They should do one of him just rolling around in audiobooks for Audible.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.720]   I was hoping we'd have an Audible ad today.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.080]   I've got so many great selections.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.080]   I feel horrible.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   We don't have it.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.080]   All right.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.600]   Is this Peter, when a product, when Apple embraces the vertical you're in and you're
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.560]   spotify and you own it, let's face it, they have 20 million.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.200]   They own it up to now.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   It's an incredible product.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.880]   They just added podcasts to it, which is amazing.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   They reached out to me.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.000]   I'm not sure exactly what they're looking to do there.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.080]   But they want to stream podcasts through this.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.800]   I know, but they don't have to ask for my permission to do that.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   I don't think.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Maybe they want to put ads against it or something.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.840]   I'm not sure why they reached out.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.280]   They may want to because for the free tier there are ads.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   Oh, there are.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.240]   Oh, so they probably need me to sign off on it or something.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   I don't care.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   I don't care.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   I don't cut my ads out of it.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   I'm fine with it.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.680]   Is this a net positive for spotify in that more people become aware of the space and then
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.320]   compare Coke and Pepsi?
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.000]   Or is this going to cut into the 20 million people?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.280]   Would you be long or short spotify?
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.840]   Well, so I think it does validate the category for spotify, which is a good thing.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.720]   I think it does suck a lot of the oxygen out of the room for anybody that isn't spotify
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.720]   in Apple music.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   Are you referring to title?
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.720]   Title.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.360]   Well, title is fairly worth even much more.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   But I think RDO.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   Rhapsody.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   Rhapsody.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   Rhapsody.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360]   Rhapsody, sir.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   I use Rhapsody.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.880]   I guess Google's option.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.040]   Google has an option too in this?
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.880]   Yeah, Google Play music.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   Okay.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   Yep.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.880]   And then actually there's also the YouTube related sort of YouTube service.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.680]   Music, music, music, music, music, key or whatever it is.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   Yeah, music, key.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.920]   So we have seven or eight of these people.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.520]   Throw Amazon in there too, why not?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   Well, the Amazon Prime one is pretty limited.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   It's limited.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.000]   But it's free with your Prime subscription.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Yep.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Spotify will be around obviously.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I think spotify is going to be there.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   I think spotify is going to be there.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   This will validate it.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.640]   iTunes will get better as a product.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.320]   It's a little bit clunky right now.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.120]   Let's assume they let Ian Rogers clean that whole mess up a little bit.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.120]   Make the software a little bit cleaner.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   It's a 1.0.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120]   It'll be a two horse race then you think.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.920]   I think it'll be a two horse race with like the smaller competitors will be in there.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.440]   It's going to be it kind of reminds me of like the airline business where they're big
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.360]   businesses but really low margin and hard to make any money.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   So.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.880]   When you run an airline you have these really high fixed costs which are fuel, toilets,
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.440]   and planes.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.400]   And rent and all these things.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.480]   And these services are the same.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.160]   I mean spotify pays 70 cents plus out of every dollar.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.200]   And Dora's been crying about their deal every year since they started.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:45.560]   I mean I think that there's this big gap between what the market values music at and
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.360]   what you can and what the industry values music at.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.120]   And bridging that gap is very difficult and we sort of come at this $10 a month way to
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.320]   split the difference.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.640]   Which is one CD which is 10 CDs a year.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.280]   But that's more than most people ever spent.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   Seven CDs a year.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.080]   If you look historically most people only spent about $60 a year on music.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.480]   So this is a huge uplift Christina.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.600]   If everybody in the country bought CDs then wound up doing this would be a huge uplift
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   wouldn't it?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   It would.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   It would.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   And the only way that this works.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.480]   I mean I spoke on Monday I spoke with Jimmy Iveen.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.760]   I spoke with Eddie Q and I spoke with Trent Rosner about Apple music.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.840]   And you know Eddie Q was really clear you know that even because I asked him I said look
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.080]   all these products are basically having the same library they're kind of offering the
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.560]   same kind of utility.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   What's your differentiator?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.760]   You know how are you going to make a difference?
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   The confusing UI.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.560]   Well I mean that's part of it.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.120]   I think their recommendations actually are a lot better.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   Then spotify's.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.720]   I've been a spotify user for like six years.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   I like spotify.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.600]   But if you're a new user kind of getting into it I think that the advantage of having all
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.800]   of your purchases to the long side.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.640]   The rest of the library sitting logs like radios sitting alongside.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   Recommendations works really well.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.560]   I think that their onboarding experience is superior.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.040]   I think that the beats one thing it could be a differentiator.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.360]   But I mean really that they're aware that the experience is going to be what has to differentiate
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   them.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.640]   But I mean you know Jimmy Iveen was really key in saying he said look the only way this
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   works the only way that the record industry that the artist that anybody makes any money
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.560]   off of this is if it scales.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.880]   And the only way it scales is if it's more than a utility and people see it as a service.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.360]   And scale is not 20 million.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.000]   20 million is a drop in the bucket.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.800]   Scale to me I would say is like 100 million 200 million.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.240]   That's what that that's if this is going to work is what it has to reach.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.400]   Yeah because right now it's it's only going to be a billion dollars in revenue in the
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   United States or something and that's not enough for the music industry.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.280]   The music industry historically was never that big of a business.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   Yes.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   So they're just crying.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.720]   Well it was kind of a problem because it blew up it reached these heights kind of
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.520]   the same time as the dot coms era.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   Because of CDs.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.800]   Because of CDs 1999 2000 with the height of Napster everything happened where the music
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.600]   industry reached these historic highs and it that was an anomaly in retrospect.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.720]   But then kind of there was the crash there was kind of the digital thing that happened
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.800]   and frankly the music industry is still responding to what happened 15 years ago with Napster.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.920]   They are still not dealing with what happened with that situation.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.680]   They still have an embraced reality and I think streaming is is kind of their last hope
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.960]   if they want this to be something that that can work.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.480]   Trent resident was saying you know he's gone through kind of the gamut you know as a legacy
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.120]   artist he has gone through the highs and the lows he left the record industry kind of establishment
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.240]   trying to do the pay your own thing try to kind of do his own.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   Brown funded.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   Exactly.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.160]   And he said you know at the end of the day all of it felt like gimmicks.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.840]   So you know he said I don't regret doing it at the time but I wouldn't do it again.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.920]   And so you know if Trent resident is saying I can't make this sort of thing work and he
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.880]   had to go back to being on a more traditional label and try to figure things out he's saying
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.320]   look at the end of the day I'm an artist period.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.240]   But his goal is to try to make it so that people can make a living doing this.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.360]   Oh Dr. Eu got rid of your.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.840]   Oh Dr. Eu got rid of your service so you're no longer paying the $10 a month.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.800]   I just I just want to say that that scale issue is the one big thing that Apple can provide
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.080]   to a music genre they like there are people that I know they're calling me up because they're
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   not savvy whatever like all this thing came on it's free for three months I tried I'm
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.400]   like well it's free for three months why wouldn't you try it and so they installed it.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.520]   So a lot of people they're going to get like that that have never paid for Spotify.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.120]   No people that don't use Pandora.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   Is it going to automatically fill all of us.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:39.920]   Put the trial on three months it does yes.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.240]   Nobody ever looks at their bills for iTunes.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.320]   For three months they get the hooking people like they get you to like it they get you
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.040]   to use it and hopefully they make a couple of tweaks and upgrades to it but Apple has
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.520]   that ability to say hey I'm putting a cookie on everybody's plate take a bite if you want
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.320]   as opposed to Google with different phones and different services different like Apple's
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:06.120]   ubiquity is just awesome for that scale so hopefully it works out for the music industry
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.120]   that will.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.920]   Does ever be built in Peter to your Verizon now that you work at Verizon or 18.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   You speak for Verizon.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.320]   Let me just hear today as the official spokesperson.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.680]   I can actually get you a great deal on service.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   Can you?
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.080]   Can I get my cap lifted.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   But as the spokesperson for Verizon which you're not what's the story with like could this
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.160]   ever just be bundled it's been done actually was it.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.240]   Was it a radio or something.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.320]   Was it cricket that offered it bundled.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.680]   I just think it should be included with your iPhone.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   AT&T actually did.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.000]   AT&T actually did they had a family plan with Beats music actually when you get into
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.320]   discount and I think sprinted to note it was T-Mobile T-Mobile who offered you some sort
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.760]   of free data transfer if you also used your streaming service.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.560]   So yeah I mean but different people have tried to bundle it.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.040]   I think that honestly having iTunes having a part of your Apple account makes easier
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.120]   for a lot of people because they've already got your credit card so that just makes it
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   easier.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.640]   I think Apple that's charged than anything else.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.560]   Apple is so profitable now and they're trying to go downstream Peter.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.760]   Wouldn't it not make sense for Apple to say we'll just pay for the first year of anybody
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.480]   who buys a new device with us because it's costing them seven bucks a month maybe they
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.200]   can get the carrier to pick up 350 of it they pick up 350 of it and just like when you
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:25.920]   buy an iPhone or you buy the new Mac it's just like hey guess what if you buy a Windows
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.600]   machine or you buy whatever else in Android you're not going to get unlimited music for
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   your first year.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.120]   Wouldn't that be like a huge differentiator in buying one now?
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:40.960]   Yes I think that they probably realize that they might get an anti-competitive.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.120]   Because if you are going to give something away like that.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.120]   Bundling is an anti-trust.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:48.400]   It creates an antitrust anti-competition issue and the last thing.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.240]   If you have market share which they don't own.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.400]   Well except that they have market share in terms of the platform and so Microsoft had
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.120]   this issue when they were trying to get into browsers which they had zero market share
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   with the browser.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.560]   They had bundle that they made the browser free.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.560]   Exactly and so.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   Rest is history.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   Yes.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.560]   I mean Apple is still the number one music retailer.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   Not yet.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.120]   You know it's falling year over year but they're still the number one music retailer.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.960]   This is where I think Prime is something very special.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.640]   How many of the four people we have on panels?
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.600]   I'm a Prime subscriber for five dollars.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   I'm Prime.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   I'm Prime.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   Who is Prime?
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   I don't think you're allowed to not be Prime.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   I think every one of them.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   Oh doc you're Prime or not.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.680]   I think every I got like four Prime's because I can't just load up the other Prime.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   So you're in your Prime.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.240]   Okay so see two of these four times faster.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.880]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.640]   Does everybody know how much Prime costs now?
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.280]   Because when it started it was 50 bucks.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.080]   It was like a number of bucks.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   What is it now?
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.240]   I think it's a hundred bucks now.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   It's a hundred bucks ninety nine dollars.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.320]   I didn't even know this was going up.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   I cannot live without Prime.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   How many people in the studio are Prime?
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.320]   I would pay a hundred fifty.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.320]   Oh my god.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.240]   Literally almost everybody except for the kid who was here with his mom.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   He didn't.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.240]   His mom has Prime.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Don't worry.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   Oh no.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   And Prime how many people who have Prime have watched an Amazon video in the last 30 days?
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   Who has loaded Amazon?
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   No.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   Okay.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.720]   Yeah watch TV on it all the time.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.600]   There's a lot of great stuff on Amazon Prime.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.760]   It's like it's I basically it's maybe in our household I would say 60% Netflix 40% Amazon
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.000]   Prime.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.240]   Why wouldn't Amazon just include this in their Prime and make Prime a little bit better?
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   They do.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   They do.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.600]   But the problem is that they can't afford to put the all a cart offering I think in the
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   service.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   I think that it would honestly hit their margins too much so instead what they have is they
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.200]   have like the radio like the Pandora type thing.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.120]   They have the music match which lets you upload your existing purchases to their library
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.680]   and then stream that and then they have like I don't know maybe like a hundred and fifty
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.320]   thousand two hundred thousand albums.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   Actually I think it's more than that.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   It might be like two million.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.760]   It's more it's very limited compared with Spotify.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   Exactly.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   It's very limited compared to Spotify.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.320]   The big thing though is that if you've uploaded your music like me I tend to have a mirror
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.880]   of my iTunes uploaded it to Amazon.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.480]   I can use like my Amazon Echo and be like play whatever and it'll play that album from
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   my playlist.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   So that's the same thing.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   I uploaded my collection.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.600]   It's like twenty five dollars a year and you upload your collection.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   I backed up my collection.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.880]   It was like I had about 125 gigs of music.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.600]   It took me about four days and I just uploaded it.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.720]   And they match everything that they have in their catalog already.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.080]   Does it support Flack or not?
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   I wonder.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.960]   I have to say like I think that I don't but I think that they then like down mix it to
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   to mp3 to playback but I think you can upload the highlights.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.600]   I've been really like getting into some Flack.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.720]   My friend was like you guys try Flack or whatever and then I got these nice speakers
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.240]   that actually read about on GDGT.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240]   Alright.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.640]   I'm this really beautiful speakers that you guys give a high rating to but they're computer
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   speakers.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.480]   I can actually think I can tell the difference.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:43.920]   I was listening to Dire Straits which is just beautiful music on the greatest hits on Flack.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.480]   Can you hear the difference Peter?
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   If I have really nice headphones and I'm playing on something that can output handle
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   the high fidelity audio I can sort of tell.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.240]   Is that the digital audio converter?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.120]   I had the Astell and Kearns player which was the twenty four.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   The Schwaendtferr bit one.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.000]   The one that I River made.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.400]   I can sort of tell but not enough to justify the hassle on the expense.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.880]   And that is titles.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   Reason desperate right?
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.080]   Like they have higher fidelity.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   And these are the same way.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.880]   Yeah they have higher fidelity streaming and to be clear there's kind of a difference
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.520]   between Flack and then having like twenty four bit Flack because you could just have
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.640]   Flack that would be from a CD file that would still be sixteen bit and technically wouldn't
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:34.920]   sound any better in a lot of A/B tests than just having an mp3 like a lame VO or an MP3
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.040]   or mp3 file or something like that.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.680]   But if you've got like a twenty four bit Flack file that's quote unquote HD audio.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:47.680]   If you've got really good hearing and good speakers then I guess that has better fidelity.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.680]   I don't know.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.160]   And so title is a complete embarrassment.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.160]   The PR.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.920]   It's a such an issue.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.920]   Yeah it's a mess.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.440]   The PR that's a company I would say I would be CEO of title.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   You would be CEO of title.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.440]   You would be CEO of title.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.440]   You would be the third one and three more.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   I think I fix it.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   I think I fix it.
