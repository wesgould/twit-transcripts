[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.920]   man who got me elected president of the internet.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   Thank you, Jason.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.840]   Thanks for having me, Leo.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.080]   Eternal fame and fortune.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.400]   Are you in the conference from there?
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960]   Are you working on a Sunday?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.280]   I am actually at the office doing some site testing.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.960]   And yeah, and dialing in is better from here.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.600]   Well, I'm glad I hope you didn't come in just for us, but I'm glad you're there.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   Thank you, sir.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.680]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.240]   From Knoxville, Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   Louisville.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.120]   I'm told that Tennessee whiskey is not bourbon.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.360]   No, it's not.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.880]   And I love that you always say Louisville correctly.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   Exactly.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.440]   I also say baller.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.040]   I found if you leave the consonants out, you really can't go far wrong, especially south
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   of the Mason Dixon.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   You got it.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   You got it.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   My.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   From Paris.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.040]   It's Patrick Bejah.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   Hey, Patrick.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.720]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.880]   Somebody asked in a conference room.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   No.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   My kitchen.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.840]   Well, you and Christina are in the same place.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   So that's perfect.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   Excellent.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.960]   Christina Warren from Majible Film Girl is in her kitchen slash studio apartment in New
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   York City.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.400]   It's not studios.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.320]   It's too bedroom, but the kitchen slash for offices are the same.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   It's all in the same spot.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   It is all in the same.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   Yep.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   So great to see you all.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.400]   Thank you all for being here.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.520]   So let me get the scorecard just so we I don't want to offend anybody.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.600]   How many of you are rooting for Edward Snowden to get away?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.240]   How many think he should be hung from the neck until dead?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.480]   There's no third option.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   No.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320]   Not according to the Justice Department, Patrick, you're a disinterested party.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.880]   You're French, right?
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   Or you just talk.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   I am French, but I don't know that I'm disinterested because all of this this story is basically,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.480]   you know, you've all been discussing is it legal?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   Is it not legal?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.840]   Can you listen to US citizens or not?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   Apparently you probably shouldn't be able to do this, but no one cares about the non-US
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   citizens.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.560]   So I'm very much concerned about that.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   That's a good point.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.280]   That's if we've not been debating that at all.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.320]   We can listen to you to the cows come on.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.600]   Yeah, there's no issue there.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.920]   Well, but just how do you feel about again, you're a somewhat disinterest part in the
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.840]   show said he didn't violate French law, he violated US law.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   Is he a traitor?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   Is he treasonous or is he a whistleblower?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   It's very difficult to say, isn't it, until we know exactly.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.880]   I guess ultimately we as a society are going to decide whether or not he is a traitor and
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.520]   no, not he's just a whistleblower.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.120]   We as a society may decide, but ultimately it's the US Justice Department that's going
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.800]   to make the ultimate decision.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   Exactly.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.320]   And that's what I mean by we as a society is the people making laws, right?
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.400]   And judging by these laws.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280]   And it obviously he revealed secrets.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   So that's not in question.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.520]   The question is by do by revealing these secrets, is he a traitor or not?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.960]   What I would wish for it to happen is for him to get a fair trial.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.800]   And I'm not exactly sure that's possible, but the best outcome would be for him to get
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   a fair trial.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.240]   And if he did commit treason, then he should be suffer the consequences quote unquote.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.600]   And if he exposed some serious flaws in the system, then I don't know, he should go that
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   route.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Christina?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   Yeah, I mean, it's I'm kind of free Snowden is kind of where I'm at.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.840]   Honestly, I mean, I kind of don't understand what's that different about him and Daniel
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.400]   Alsberg with the Pentagon papers.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.920]   I think that you could make the argument that Bradley Manning is a different case.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.560]   You know, he was a member of the military.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.280]   He revealed things that were of a more sensitive nature that weren't vetted as much.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   But in this case, I mean, this was a civilian who happened to have a contract job.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.200]   And if what he's saying is true, then I honestly think that the public value of that information
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   is better than outweighs the, I guess, treasonous implications that they could have.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.680]   And you could make the case that Bradley Manning in danger, do you as citizens abroad with
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.480]   his real, his leaks?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.840]   You can't make that case with Edward Snowden.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.720]   No, I mean, I think in this case, all it's really doing is it the question is, did it
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.320]   endanger kind of the PR for the NSA and for maybe like the FBI?
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.840]   And that really is a little concerned to me.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.800]   What I'm not sure about though, I mean, I guess is how much is what he is he saying that
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.760]   is correct and how much is maybe being inflated for his own gains?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   And that's not really clear yet.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.360]   But I think that if it is what it seems to be, I mean, honestly, yeah, I'm free Snowden.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.440]   I mean, I feel like this is why we have whistleblower laws.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.520]   But at the same point, Patrick's point, I don't think it's going to be possible for
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   him to get a fair trial.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.400]   And I mean, I think that the best thing he could hope for is that they somehow violate
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.920]   his looking at his mental health records or something the same way they did with Ellsberg.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.400]   And that was how he ended up not being prosecuted for the Pentagon papers.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   That's right.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.360]   The plumbers were caught breaking into a psychiatrist's office.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   Right.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.720]   I mean, you almost have to wonder, you know, if something like that is not to happen or
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   if it hadn't happened in Ellsberg's case, what would that have meant for the entire
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.800]   narrative of what became the Vietnam War and for Nixon's second term and for a lot of
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   other things?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:55.000]   And I mean, I think that's why it's not clear to just maybe classify him as a, you know,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.040]   someone who's committing treason because what he's doing could potentially be opening
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   up something that is vital for the public to know about and certainly vital for us to
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.880]   have a discussion about what are our real reasonable expectations of privacy and what
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.280]   does it mean for the fourth amendment?
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.200]   You agree, Jason?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   Yes.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.360]   So first, I'd like to say I always, you know, we live in a democracy.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.160]   So I always don't like when we talk about it in a democracy and we say, you know, oh,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.200]   it's the government's fault and that the government is always us.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   It's us.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Right?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.840]   We are, they are accountable and responsible to us.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.680]   So if we unless they go so far as to not be, and that's, of course, the great fear of
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   all of this is that true.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.400]   When does it go from being government of the people by the people for the people to government
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.280]   by the governing for the governing?
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   And that's actually, that's actually one of the great concerns here.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.440]   And I was saying I would like for him to get a fair trial, but at the same time, I'm not
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.280]   even sure it's possible because even we've seen at least we suspect that the NSA has
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.800]   been lying to the different bodies that it's supposed to be answering to or at least to
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.880]   our supposed to be overseeing their activities.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.560]   So when it reaches that level of uncertainty, it becomes very murky.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   Even what you're talking about, Jason, which is we are the government, are we really in
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.680]   that case, deciding what happens?
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.800]   We don't, when we don't even know what happens.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   Right.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:33.320]   That's where, but we do know now, and that's why I think Snowden ultimately has done something
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.520]   all heroic, right?
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.600]   He found the government doing something that it should not have been doing, and he exposed
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   it.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.280]   I mean, obviously there's still a lot, like everyone else, I'd like to read more about
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.760]   the details of what really happened and what else might have been leaked or whatever.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:57.120]   It does not appear as if he leaked anything that would cause danger to anyone, any US
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.040]   citizens or military or intelligence, but he did catch the US government doing something
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.800]   that they should not have done.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:13.880]   And that's why ultimately, I think he deserves our support and to stand up for somebody that
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   has leaked something that we would all like to know about so that we can hold the government
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.360]   accountable for doing something that is sort of extra legal.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.720]   And of course, General James Clapper, who blatantly lied to Congress when asked if the
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.000]   NSA collected this data, he's going to go scot-free.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.600]   No contempt of Congress there.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   You know, I think we owe a debt, a gratitude to Edward Snowden.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.040]   I don't know if he would get a fair trial in the US.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.760]   I feel like at this point, we're all just going, "Run Snowden, run."
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   And I don't know if there's anywhere you can run to in this world anymore.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.840]   So I feel better for him.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.240]   The Clapper thing though, he was actually, as you're saying, he did blatantly lie.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.960]   Isn't how come he's not suffering any kind of consequence?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.400]   He lied to the Senate, right?
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.280]   And that's representatives of the people.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.520]   He actually lied to the American people where he should actually, according to the law, have
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.080]   told the truth.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080]   And that's why.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.320]   So, frankly, why I think there's a legitimate argument that Snowden is a whistleblower,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.280]   that he is in fact telling us something we wouldn't have known otherwise because our
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.320]   own government and the director of national intelligence is lying.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.840]   So the only way to find this out is for somebody like Snowden to step forward.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.400]   You know, it's a tech show and I understand people feel like this is politics, but there
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.600]   is a very strong angle of technology to this because the real question is, can we, are
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.240]   electronic communications in some way less privileged than snail mail?
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.640]   There's nobody asserting that the NSA is going through your mail, opening your mail.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.000]   They're much better protections, frankly, against that than there are against them opening
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   your email.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.880]   In fact, many courts have held and it's the position of the federal government that after
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   six months, it's not even your email anymore.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   It's abandoned.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   It's absolutely the stuff we should be talking about on a tech show.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.160]   We have created as part of a society and as technologists and people working and covering
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   this industry have created a new set of possibilities, a new set of rules.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.920]   And as a result, we have to deal with a new set of values in order to live in the society
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.080]   that we're shaping.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.640]   So we should be talking about this and I expect we are going to be talking even more about
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:50.000]   it over the next decade as sort of data and all of this stuff becomes more and more available
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.880]   and accessible and things like this are going to happen likely again and again.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.200]   And we have to hold people's feet to the fire for doing stuff like this.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.240]   You may notice I've been watching carefully the news media and see what they call him
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.520]   because they could call him a traitor.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.000]   They could call him a whistleblower.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.840]   They've decided to CNN and others have decided.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   Apparently this is because the AP style guide decided that the safest thing to call him
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.320]   is a leaker.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.960]   Which frankly is not a very...
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   Oh boy.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   Don't tell me you love it when as the media and we rely on the AP style guide.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.240]   I mean seriously, just because we don't want it because CNN doesn't want to make a judgement
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.400]   call or the New York Times doesn't want to make a judgement call.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.000]   Like man up and make an opinion when we're the other.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.440]   Well this is the unfortunate he said she said the dichotomy that a media watchers like Jay
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.480]   Rosen have talked a lot about that.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.600]   Well all we have to do is get somebody from each side and straddle the fence and we're
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.840]   objective and that's not really quite the case is it?
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   No.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   Because some sides can be really really wrong.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:14:00.280]   And so straddling the fence is not helpful to the republic that we live in I'm afraid.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.680]   Intelligent analysis goes a lot more.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.040]   But that's a very dangerous line though.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.600]   If you start asking the media to decide who is and who isn't a trader.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.760]   It's in this case it might be the thing we want them to do but there are a lot of cases
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.600]   where you want them to remain as objective as possible.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:29.280]   So as a general rule I guess leaker is probably better than trader or patriot.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   Or whistleblower.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   We don't know either or whistleblower.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   Whistleblower is probably the most accurate.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.320]   We don't know if he's a trader or a patriot.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   Yep.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.760]   And any event.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.480]   I don't want to belabor it but since this is what everybody's watching today is his
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   progress he flew from Hong Kong to Russia and apparently is on his way to either Ecuador,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.120]   Venezuela or points unknown.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.280]   If he's smart it's points unknown.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.120]   I think it was confirmed he's going to Ecuador.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.640]   I was looking you know Wikipedia I said it's too bad there's nowhere you can go to find
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.760]   out who has extradition treaties with the US.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.600]   Well Wikipedia does and pretty much everybody has an extradition treaty.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.240]   So you can't get out North Korea maybe.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.120]   Yeah and it's ironic isn't it?
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.080]   The places he's going are the places with far less freedom than we have.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   Right.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.640]   No I mean that that is the irony is that he has to go those places in order to prevent
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.640]   extradition.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:34.800]   Yeah there's definitely a feeling that he was very careful in what he did in order to
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.720]   not put anyone in danger and if anything else I have no I have very little doubt about
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.200]   his sincerity.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.640]   I guess that's something.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.400]   I think so too although you can again you don't know you can't.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   Yeah you never.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.280]   You're judging based on you know his body language and what you think and I just don't
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   know if we know.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.320]   I do like Mike Elgin's article in Computer World on how to run your own NSA spy program.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.280]   I got to get my gun to talk about that.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.560]   He said you know everybody's talking about prism it's the federal government's discovered
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.320]   big data the theory being just save everything and use technology to search it for it.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.920]   He says you can do the same thing.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.320]   He says here's how to run your own and you know I kind of like this your own private
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.000]   prism program.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.800]   Save everything of course Google now offers 15 gigs of free storage and he suggests I
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.280]   think this is an interesting idea.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   I use this for a while and it did generate a lot of email use the Google alerts service
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.960]   so you can say any subject that you're interested in.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   He says just have Gmail filter that in a folder you don't have to put it in your inbox file
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.960]   it away you can search for it later.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.480]   Do you guys use in your trade Google alerts to keep track of stories.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.800]   It did before it's stuff working.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.920]   Does it not want work anymore.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.200]   It's funky and there was a experience I guess it was like in March right around the same
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.240]   time they announced that they were killing Google Reader that the Google alerts so maybe
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.920]   like stopped working reliably too and so and it's been buggy for a really long time.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.440]   So it's hard to it's not something I can rely on but it's certainly useful for certain
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440]   topics.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   That is enough.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   Yeah totally.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.920]   I run it of course is they still you subscribe to an RSS feed of Google search of Google
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   alert summary.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   You just yeah there's just nothing in it.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   There's just nothing in it.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.320]   There's nothing in it and no place to read it.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.960]   No place to read it but other than that it's great.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.240]   But other than that it's one of those things that I think Google like used to have you know
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.760]   probably a dozen people on and now nobody's working on it.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.040]   You know nobody's really working on it or very just maintenance and not so much maintenance.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.840]   Mike also says there's a Google Scholar alerts I don't know if that works any better but
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.360]   that searches academic books papers and other resources for so you can use that to keep
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.680]   track of things in academic papers.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:59.120]   Then he says turn on Google voice so that everything is in box metadata.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   Good word.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   Metadata on all your calls full data on your SMS chats transcripts of recorded calls and
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.880]   voicemails even the sound recording of your voicemails throw that all in a folder save
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.600]   all your Google Hangouts.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.400]   He says then use if this than that to suck metadata for it.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:21.200]   Just blow up that big data, harvest it all, save it to Google Drive and then use algorithmic
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.880]   filters just like the big boys at the NSA to look for keywords.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.320]   So what I'm saying is basically turn the give Google the chance to be the NSA right?
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   Yeah I hear are you afraid of Google still after this?
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   Oh gee they may serve me a targeted ads.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.120]   They may tell a marketer what I'm interested.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   Oh, horrors.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:50.040]   Yeah, no I'm more concerned with are they giving my information freely to the government?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.760]   That's that's honestly more mean.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.000]   Do you think that I really feel like when Facebook and Google and these other guys vigorously
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.320]   designed we are not that they're honest in that respect.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.880]   I don't think they need to by the way.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.600]   We've I think pretty conclusively figured out and credit to Steve Gibson for the first
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   point this out that all the government has to do is tap them upstream right where they
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.640]   join the internet and Google has no complicity no complete no knowledge but everything in
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.960]   and out of Google is stored by the NSA.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   Great point.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.600]   So I frankly think Google is being honest when they say absolutely not.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.680]   Sorry I'm getting a text message from Google.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   It would seem like all of these denials were so carefully crafted that they they couldn't
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.320]   I can't imagine they would lie on those.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.280]   No, a little bit too big.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.800]   I think what they want to do in Google and Facebook and everybody is asking the government
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.720]   for permission to do this is to say at least how many times they get requested for information
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.120]   by the federal government and all they can say right now is lump all the law enforcement
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.040]   requests together you know and that's really kind of in fact Google even said that's that's
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.760]   doing people to service to say when when Facebook says we got nine to 10,000 government requests
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.640]   last quarter.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's meaningless because how many of those are national security letters and how many
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.640]   those are local law enforcement helping somebody find their iPhone and there's a big difference.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.360]   I don't know that it's I don't know that it's meaningless because the story at the time
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.040]   was the government is looking at everyone you know everyone's email almost directly in
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:27.320]   real time and they said it's only a very small fraction of the of our users that we give
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.680]   out information about it.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.840]   You know when when the story is the government is looking at all of your account you know
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.480]   a billion accounts and you tell the story that they're actually only looking at you
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.080]   know it was 10,000 requests for what was it 30,000 accounts.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.680]   It does put things in context.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.640]   Yeah, and so here's the thesis and we've mentioned this last week but so apologies if
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.440]   you've heard it before but I think it's important to know if if you are the NSA or the FBI or
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.120]   any other secret three letter agency what you want to do is collect everything regardless
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.240]   and I think that that's probably what's happening.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.880]   US citizen not US citizen international traffic not in there.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   Collect it all.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.640]   That's why they built a five z at a bite facility in Utah to store it.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.520]   Then when you decide oh this person's a target of us you know a person of interest then you
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.680]   go to Google and you say hey you know who was using the internet at this time at this
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   state we know that somebody was because we captured this downstream.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.760]   Google has to tell you and by the way is forbidden from telling us now they've attached a name
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.680]   to that data and they go through more data and find more stuff build up a nice little
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.280]   packet of incriminating evidence to go after you with.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.680]   So collecting everything just makes sense even if you don't even look at it.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.480]   You got it case you want it later and I think that's probably what's going on.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   And you can search it.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.040]   Yeah eventually if you collect everything the idea is you can search it even if right
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.560]   now we don't even have enough right mechanisms to search it all but the hope is well searches
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.880]   catching up and catching up and catching up eventually we can search it all and boom.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.760]   Well I think we can do it now I think we're pretty good at this kind of stuff.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:19.480]   But playing devil's advocate for for for a second wouldn't we want a super spy agency
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.360]   to collect everything they can collect maybe not you know the internal well I guess that's
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.480]   the point that the emails that we don't want people to read but that's their mandate.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   Well if what you if your goal in life is perfect security like I don't want anybody
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.200]   to do anything bad against us in the United States this would be a good way to you know
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.160]   start to pursue that.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:48.640]   And I don't just deny that but I do fear that it also gives less benign governments or and
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   we've seen this happen again and again a tool that they can use to persecute people and
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.840]   I fear they'll be used that way too.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.800]   But I mean if it's if it's only the public data which is available but they think everything
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.560]   is public the IRS thinks all your emails public all your phone calls are public.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.960]   Yeah that's yeah.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.400]   And I'm sure it's the same by the way I'm sure it's the same in France.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.560]   Well I'm sure we would like to do that but we don't have the technical know how to do
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   it.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   Hey we can help you.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.360]   I'm sorry Christina you're going to say something.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.120]   No it's going to say I mean it's interesting if you look at like classic Fourth Amendment
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.600]   cases you know about search and seizure and the expectation of privacy you know when certain
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   types of pornography were still illegal and they would come into someone's house under
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.320]   one guy's and they would search into areas for something that they weren't even looking
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.280]   for and they were able to find something in the context of that you know whether or not
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.960]   the question was whether or not can that be used you know to charge someone for a crime
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.280]   and there have been various rulings on that on both sides that's where I think it becomes
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.960]   scary in that if you just happen to be caught in the crossfires of something and by going
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.040]   through your data they find out oh you've you know committed this misdemeanor or this
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.640]   you know felony possession of drugs or you know something that might not even be the
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   context of you know like terrorism or what not I think people worry about that and it's
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.560]   a mission expedition.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.960]   Absolutely and for me the bigger concern would be for local governments and for state governments
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.000]   rather than even the federal government you know because it's only a matter of time before
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   those agencies either get access especially if you're talking about a big database and
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.920]   whatnot and that's where you typically see a lot of the most the fishing expeditions
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.440]   and people being persecuted for reasons that are that are not what they seem to be you
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.520]   know when people are kind of you know gone after because they didn't comply with something
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.280]   else and I think that's for me the most worrying aspect I mean I understand the point of saying
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.880]   well why not just capture it all and have a database and I think that that's that's
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:56.400]   fine if as you said your goal is to prevent bad things from happening but by the same token
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.040]   you know how much information are you going to be have what sort of profile are you going
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.560]   to be having on people and at what point as you said our governments not even maybe ours
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   but the other countries going to start using that as a reason to go after people just because
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.960]   they're politically dissident or they're you know making trouble and that's the really
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   scary thing you can make a case that the IRS has gone after political dissidents already
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:26.640]   and the Tea Party stuff I don't know about that but certainly people are there's some
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.840]   evidence that the government has already done that many times and you know under Nixon under
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.480]   J over yeah oh definitely well that I don't I mean I think that's the big thing right
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.040]   is that when you look back through history and you can see the Nixon administration with
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.200]   the Hoover you know era of the FBI you can see these clear violations of personal privacy
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   you know looking back through you know the McCarthyism and if all that was able to happen
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.840]   without having those access to that much information what could you do now that you have so much
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.920]   more personal information and so much so much personal correspondence that is taking place in
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.160]   avenues that are searchable you know earlier you said you'd obviously it's easier for them to do it
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.480]   with email digital mail than than postal mail well part of that is because the process of
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.520]   actually going through and scanning doing OCR and doing analysis of every single mail letter would
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.240]   be a tremendous undertaking that would require so much more effort than it is to just you know tap
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.680]   into web mail servers and and capture that data and and then do you know kind of bullion search
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.000]   against or an algorithmic search against so it's it's much easier for the mail to get that data
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.120]   than it ever was before and if you look at the cronyism and the things that our own government
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.240]   was able to do even in the last 50 years I think that's why people have I know that's why I'm
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.680]   I'm concerned and I'm typically not one of those like oh you know my my privacy is sacrosanct but
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:54.000]   it's like it makes you wonder hey guys yeah oh sorry yes there's a smoke detector going off but
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.120]   it's not in our office sorry it's Christina she can't fix it just for those of you tuning in we're
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.360]   saying it's my smoke detector she can't fix it's in her hallway and union regulations prohibit her
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.920]   from getting on a very tippy ladder to fix it so which is the answers will go nuts we're not going
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.360]   to let her do that there's anybody on the teamsters watching the show he sends someone
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:21.760]   here's but you please put a battery in it thank you come across you know I'm I'm trying to be the
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.400]   devil's advocate here and it's very difficult because I actually agree with everything you're
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.240]   saying but you could play the part of the devil's advocate though I usually do trying so I'll let
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   you know looking looking taking an outsider's view which you know as you said I'm French
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:46.640]   I'm wondering do you guys feel like this is kind of a a 9/11 hangover wearing off that we're seeing
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:54.800]   because these debates have been posed before and no one seemed to be willing to listen and
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.600]   they're very important questions that you're asking so yeah do you feel like the the mood
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.280]   around these questions is changing that's a good point these would not be asked if this were
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:10.800]   October 1st 2011 or 2001 rather nobody be asking this question we'd all be going yes you got to do
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.920]   this I mean it's always a peacetime versus wartime question right during during wartime you don't
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:22.480]   you hardly even ask these questions because it's like you know your existence is called into question
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.640]   and right but in peacetime it's absolutely critical to ask these questions and that's why
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:36.320]   yeah I do Patrick I see that the tenor of these questions and the pitch being much higher than it
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:43.440]   would have been a decade ago and I think people are you know regular people are a little uncomfortable
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.520]   with the possibilities of you know what can what what's possible in terms of them being tracked
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.840]   in them their their data being accessed it also changes the conversation a little bit because
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.000]   you know with Microsoft screwing and all of this stuff oh screw is watching you the gmailman is
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.960]   watching you it changes the conversation a little bit we've been you know I I've always said this
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   we've been paying attention to the wrong bad actors here and if you're worried about cool your ISP
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.560]   knows a lot more and is much more likely to share it with the FBI than Google because no without a
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.920]   doubt I mean I I was a freshman in college when when 9/11 happened and I remember I was in a public
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.160]   policy class and we were talking about actually kind of this sort of information stuff and I was
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.840]   pointing out I had friends who worked at Earthlink and this before broadband was mainstream and when
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.680]   someone would call in they'd log into their account and they could access everyone's email they could
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.320]   go through a customer's email account and see everything that was happening and that was kind of a
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.040]   wake-up call for me that you know even back then your ISP had access to your and higher mail server
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.200]   and you know where you're browsing and most people don't think about things in that context and most
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.960]   ISPs have much lower standards for what they're going to give the government without a doubt without
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:00.880]   a doubt and so you know that's always been I think uh to you know that that's always been something
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:07.600]   that's been possible but I think the difference maybe and in now versus in 2001 is just the breadth
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.920]   of information that we have available so even though I definitely agree that the tenor is different
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   because it's wartime peacetime I also think that the the amount of information that we have stored on
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   these on the internet and the way that we use the internet has you know jumps a hundred times
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.920]   versus where we were in 2001 that makes it different too you know I mean I think that that that changes
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.520]   the nature of the conversation kind of to the earlier point of why we should be talking about
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:39.360]   this on a technology show because it is an implicit trade-off with doing all the stuff online and
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.680]   with you know the internet and with technology becoming um so much more advanced you know here's
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:51.600]   a good example you know when AT this was in 2006 a whistleblower came forward and said you know the
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.000]   NSA has a secret room at AT&T in San Francisco and they uh and they're capturing all the AT&T
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.160]   world net traffic but even then they weren't saving they couldn't save it all it was too much
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.000]   traffic to save so they would just filter on some keywords well that's changed in six years now
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.640]   they can save it all now they have much better we have much better big data analysis tools
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.680]   and data you know saving we can you know obviously you can correct compress the stuff you have more
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.080]   data right um and you know what we've just scratched the surface on this five years from now it's
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.360]   going to be not only are you going to be able to save it all instant it's going to be a lot
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.920]   more data right hundreds of times more but you'll be able to save it instantaneously or we will
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:36.400]   research it almost instantaneously and uh you know pre-crime here it comes baby we'll know before
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.600]   you commit a crime what you're up to it is happening it is happening it is happening
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.960]   you know uh here's the final piece and we'll move on um i have recommended in the past people
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.840]   use pgp or some other open source encryption uh to protect them protect themselves to protect
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   your privacy with the onion router tor and uh we found out if you read closely uh what the NSA
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:04.720]   was saying they especially save stuff that is encrypted by pgp or tor because you know we can't
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.960]   be sure where it came from so we're just going to assume that it's uh international traffic
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.360]   so i in effect have been just flagging everything i do for the last ten years
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:19.040]   hey see capture my stuff let's hope they can't decrypt it they can't yet but maybe with quantum
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.920]   computing and someday they'll be able to one last note that um berserker in the chat room
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:31.200]   pointed a good point out that remember um that congress uh and and the courts still do oversee
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.320]   the NSA they don't get off scott free to do whatever they want no but we have to push congress on the
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.600]   courts to do to do that absolutely yes because they in many cases i think they've just put their
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.240]   hands up and said yeah we need the congress is worried about being elected yeah well that's how
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.440]   you get up that's even i think that the the most important thing in in this is what we were saying
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   earlier the people who are supposed to be over seeing this are being lied to by the right people
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.400]   who they're overseeing that's the the core and they're doing nothing when they find this out
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.720]   yeah like diane feinstein a defended general clipper i mean it's unbelievable you know instead of
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.040]   saying yeah he lied to us and we're not happy about that she said well he maybe misunderstood the
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   question what damn it you know that there's going to be senators and and congressmen um that are
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.080]   going to be more than happy to throw this guy under the bus soon if this turns if the public turns
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.760]   against you know this idea they will absolutely throw him under the bus i mean he you know already
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:37.280]   his career is is quite in jeopardy um in in the future but uh i i think that um it's why we should
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.840]   talk about this and i know we've you know we're at the end of at the segment but but it you know if
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:48.960]   we can help put uh pressure on them to do the right thing here that's a good thing i agree and the
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.280]   best way to do it go to eff.org uh they have uh great tools to help you it's it's it's a big part
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   of what they're up to call one what was that stop three two three nsa they have a special phone number
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.600]   you can call basically the best thing you can do is call your member of congress uh or mail them
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   snail mail them and uh and let them know that you're a constituent it's somebody you vote for your
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.760]   senator or your member of the house and uh say you got to fight this you got to stop this
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.440]   this is not a black hole either call or send a snail mail it sounds you know anachronistic but
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.240]   there it is and kudos to the eff because uh uh at once again they're stepping up yes
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:36.720]   uh and i donate money on a monthly basis to them and i even gave them a big chunk when they uh we're
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.160]   pursuing this podcast to throw i donated a chunk of money for that too because uh they're good they're
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.040]   good thank god they exist we are talking about yes it's tech in fact coming up we're gonna talk
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.680]   about instagram having video but uh you know everything else seems so unimportant after all
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.960]   of it uh but we were doing it with christina warren from mashable film girl do you still use the
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.440]   film girl uh handle i've fallen you for years on twitter because everyone knows me that way
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.640]   and stuck with it was that because you were like you were into film i was yeah i went to film school
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.000]   no kidding actually my my academic background is in film yeah wow do you do anything with that
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   uh no that's a shame more i know there's this thing called kickstarter go there say i want
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.760]   money i'm gonna make a movie and they'll give you money i've actually thought about doing that about
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:31.120]   software development oh she's a little she's a little busy writing you know oh yeah yeah busy
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   busy she writes a day you're talking to the wrong person about busy so no seriously what would you
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:42.480]   like to do a like a software development like um something like uh watch you know like uh
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.600]   steven levi did uh with hackers watch them at work and exactly like documentary just
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.800]   i love that would you do that indy um indy gave the movie i thought was really great and i thought
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.040]   you know i would love to see this though but about software developers and like mobile
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.400]   app developers or you know uh isb's or enterprise software developers just the whole process because
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.920]   i think as a creative work it's not um understood as being a creative work enough and it really is
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.160]   the everything that goes into oh yeah designing and executing software i think that'd be a great
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:19.200]   doc project have you read tracy kidders the soul of a new machine yes that is one of my favorite
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.640]   of all time and it's now pretty dated it's ancient he was at digital equipment in 1981
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.240]   which ironically is my husband's uh one of his first jobs was it was a dc right
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:38.160]   yeah right right before uh via a compact bottom and um yeah and but reading that that book is
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.440]   amazing and it's that's what i'd like to see you do in a film a film version of something you know
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:50.160]   uh there's a there's other books uh g pascal zakry wrote a book uh called showstoppers about the
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.680]   development of nt where he was he was kind of an embedded reporter in the process what a great
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.880]   uh film girl do that okay tell lance you need a sabbatical and you're gonna be making a movie
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:11.920]   okay no it's a great idea though no i honestly think about a lot wouldn't it be fun yeah i well
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.320]   we'll good plug the hell out of it and out of your kickstarter or your indy gogo so you could
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.000]   raise some money do that also with us uh jason hiner from tech republic part of the cbs interactive

[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.440]   sixteen seventy eight really i really like these people uh we're talking about technology
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   instagram ads video five million videos uploaded in the first hour the instagram story is is really
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.600]   great so kevin systrom and company come up with a beautiful app they were doing bourbon which was
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.320]   kind of a flop they flipped over to uploading beautiful images i'm not much later six months
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.800]   something like that later uh facebook buys them for a million and the reason it's obvious now
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.640]   is that people were kids the young people the future of facebook we're leaving facebook and
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.880]   droves to use instagram they preferred it uh then along comes vine instagram paid a billion
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.800]   facebook paid a billion for instagram the kids suddenly they start using vine oh no
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.160]   and this is and of course twitter owns vine they they learned from because they missed instagram
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.200]   they learned they bought vine and then the snapchat thing is also huge with the kids
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.840]   facebook mark zuckerberg himself writes a poke and add some snapchat features the kids go
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   and they're using vine they're using uh snapchat and facebook's a little bit worried so
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.840]   what do you do last week they added video to instagram i asked my kids i have an 18 and a 21 year old
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.960]   the 18 year the 18 year olds immediately started posting stupid videos of him sleeping
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:04.560]   uh the 20 the 21 year old says i why are they putting videos instagram is about photography
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.920]   and i i might i kind of maybe agree with her is this a good move for instagram five million videos
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:16.160]   in the first day christina you're a filmmaker yeah no i mean i think it's smart i think that
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   it's something that they definitely had to do because uh i don't know how much traction vine was really
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.160]   taking it's kind of hard to tell because don't you think it's risky though because you could
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.600]   alienate the instagram base couldn't you you could um i think they're doing it the right way one it's
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.720]   limited it's limited to 15 seconds to the way that it shows up in your feed if you wanted to ignore
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.920]   and not tap and play the videos you can you can just scroll by and exactly you know you see that the
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.800]   cover of the cover you know image and um i think the aspect of adding a filter to it is unique i
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.080]   also think that the fact that they let you delete um the little bits of clips you do uh makes it a
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.440]   little bit better than vine in some instances but video is hard right i mean i mean that's the thing
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.320]   is that photography is one of those things where if you frame something even half decently and you
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.280]   put a decent filter on that you can make right a bad looking photo good that's what can instagram
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.200]   talk people photography takes no talent just put a nice filter on it but but video is really not
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.400]   the same way and the video takes a lot especially when you're talking about a limited amount of time
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.560]   it takes a lot more planning and um it's uh much harder to do it right and so honestly
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.000]   you know i think that they did it in the right way because i don't know how long it will be
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.920]   sticky if that makes any sense i feel like this could be a fad whereas photography is kind of ever
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.480]   vesan and you know videos people are either going to do something longer where they're going to want
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:49.200]   to use vimeo or youtube or they're going to be doing very artistic very cool um structured kind of
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.520]   you know stop motion or or well designed shorter clips um i i kind of don't know long term with the
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.160]   life cycle is on i'm having a 15 second video clip but i think that the way that they've done it is
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:06.560]   smart because it works similarly enough to an existing product but you are within the instagram
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.120]   ecosystem which frankly is a lot better in a lot of ways than vine because i think one of the
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.360]   reasons why instagram was so successful is it started as its own social network first and even
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.240]   after facebook bought it it is still remained in large parts separate you know sure you can see
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.600]   the post that people do to your news feed and and likes now kind of go bet both ways but by and
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.960]   large you know you open up the instagram app and that's where you consume all that material because vine
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.920]   launched after it had already been acquired by twitter i don't think that it ever had a chance
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.080]   to kind of grow its own social graph that's separate from twitter so it's it's not one of those
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.720]   things where at least i know i don't open up the vine app and start looking for people's vine
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:51.040]   it's too annoying it's exactly noisy uh audio is a real problem on these short videos because
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   i was gonna say that's that's the big that's my biggest complaint right now with instagram for
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.160]   video is that there's not a way to mute um the audio because most of the time um for what you want
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:05.840]   to do it works better to have no sound at all they need to be able to turn off audio absolutely
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.600]   i mean we've got a one of our our community producers Jeremy he is amazing he does some of the most
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.840]   amazing vine work you'll ever see if you look at some of the stuff on mashable's vine account he
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.680]   does the most amazing stop motion stuff i mean literally he will plan things out and it will take
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:27.040]   him you know an hour to set up the perfect shot and so he's already been some instagram things but
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.320]   he's like a real artist like he's doing incredible stuff but that thing most interesting on vine was
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.520]   the animated stuff that we were able to do exactly and so it was a immense amount of work yes i mean
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.640]   that's what Jeremy does a ton of and so i think it'll be interesting to see if there's able to be
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.280]   kind of a new kind of instagram for video sort of art form if there's a certain you know just like
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.040]   out with instagram posts you know you have the uh kind of the stereotypical types of instagram posts
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:59.600]   you know outside the airplane you know um of your coffee of your shoes uh you know of the rain of
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.560]   kind of a sideways look at the sky you know and i'm guilty of all of these if you look at my instagram
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.880]   feet that's basically my sister a song wasn't there a funny song yeah yeah all the cliched
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.480]   instagram pictures and it's so embarrassing because you watch the song and you go oh yeah
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.240]   oh it's so perfect and then they did it to the tune of that nickelback song photos that's right
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.120]   that's what it was better yeah so good um so i think that'll be interesting to see if this is able to
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   take off and uh there was a kind of a instagram for video sort of meme culture that takes off but
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:34.000]   i'm not really sure i mean they have five million uploads the first day but i'm kind of of the opinion
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.080]   that the video is just so much harder it might be one of those things that fizzles out and if
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.160]   that's the case then i almost feel like facebook did this or instagram did this in the right way and
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:50.080]   that it's not deviating from the core experience um and if it does become less popular they won't
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.880]   have you know invested in this holy separate product or anything i think it's between like fine
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:04.640]   and sorry patrick the difference between like vine and um uh and instagram video is i think that
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:11.840]   vine didn't really poison the well right it there's such a twitter is such a feed thing anyway you get
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.120]   lots of stuff you ignore 60% of it you're looking for the little bit of good stuff that you know
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   you're you're sort of interested in um instagram is a little different in that it's for stylistic
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:30.240]   photos although i'd argue and my wife who is a photographer uh was certainly um say that that
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:37.200]   filters ruin as many photos as they fix um so um but but that's because she's a pro and knows better
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:43.920]   everybody else goes oh you antique that it's gorgeous yeah you're so i bet but it's i mean i'm
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.680]   sort of over instagram and and have not been big on it but everybody i know that that uses instagram
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.280]   that actually posted something about it on twitter afterward they said uh you know that
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.920]   that just ruined my feed all these videos just ruined my feed and so it's kind of like that's
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.640]   why i say it sort of poisoned the well for for instagram whereas i felt like that wasn't the case
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.520]   with vine the vine is just sort of annoying and you kind of annoying because it's six seconds
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:16.720]   which is just too short to do anything i i disagree i think vine created something that's
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:24.640]   not a photo and not a video like this is not a video yeah it's it's sort of a kind of animated
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.560]   gif and and video never really made it maybe instagram is gonna work and you're right christina
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:37.440]   they did make it exactly as it should be but i really think vine is something completely different
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.400]   it's it's you can use you know you can use it for videos and you can take small videos to show
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:50.240]   what you're doing but all the editors pick here are are something else you know that it's it's a
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.640]   vine it's a unique divine experience i think you're right patrick uh it is its own thing well no i
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.600]   i'm actually it's fine right vine you can actually do kind of what christina was talking about early
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.680]   sorry i hate mine you can upload stuff like that and it loops it loops i think instagram did some
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.600]   things now maybe that's just because i'm an old fart so what i like why i like instagram
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   better is it's 15 seconds still has the same editing capability it doesn't loop
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:23.360]   which i find very annoying and then i don't understand this you're right this is an animated
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:30.480]   gif isn't it these are just animated gifts yeah um but the the other oh my god well i know this
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.120]   some of the stuff here this is one of my favorites though i have to say i really like this and
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.000]   this could loop forever as far as i'm concerned we're looking at vines this is the editor's picks
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.280]   section see you you went on the story for instagram videos you ended up watching and then i'm
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   playing vines now maybe you're right yeah but but the the 15 second thing on instagram is really
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.720]   interesting right it's it's uh i can't remember who i'm sorry but someone was saying it's the length
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:03.600]   of uh one of the formats of the tv ad it is for ads it's for ads it's very clear totally about ads
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:10.480]   so if you think people hate them now uh wait until they see their their tv ads showing up there
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.280]   well i already see you know tumblr has already been ruined by yahoo and i don't think yahoo even
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:21.040]   owns them yet but all of a sudden i'm seeing it closed on friday it closed yeah i'm ready
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.560]   yep i thought them jeez no regulatory or anything they just wasn't cashed deal too wasn't i think
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:32.400]   that's part of the cash well but even before it closed all of a sudden in my tumblr feed i'm seeing
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.800]   ads for tv shows animated gifts from bad hairspray ads and stuff and i just really ruined it
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.160]   as far as i'm concerned i think the same thing might happen instagram i don't know
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.840]   it's a risky video ruins everything that's bad video is bad for everybody
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.760]   but i you know i get a headache from vid to me it's the audio why don't both of these guys why
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.720]   don't they have an no audio switch when you record these well you know what the vines we've been
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:02.160]   watching from your ipad works perfect work perfect they're better without the audio without audio
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.600]   yeah because the audio is so choppy because of the six seconds you have to really heavily edit
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.040]   um if i turn on the audio you'll find these much more annoying
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   that's just annoying period i don't know what the hell that is it's a bad dream the guy just had
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.200]   but that is you know these are really unique in the sense that they have found a new medium
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.440]   this i mean you would have thought this up
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:29.520]   so is it a good thing or a bad thing i don't know so somebody pointed out our attention has
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.920]   been so bad that people are complaining that they've gone from six to 15 seconds that's too long
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:42.080]   that's so long i can't pay attention for 15 seconds it's very interesting to watch and of course the
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:49.200]   battle continues because the twitter won't embed facebook the instagram posts in anymore in the
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.280]   twitter cards and now the video and they're going back and forth it's just it's crazy
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:00.560]   the chat is mentioning that csmith actually did this a while ago seven seconds videos they had
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.080]   the killer service i should point it out because it's yeah it was luigi
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   text america did mobile logging in 2001 but it's all about timing isn't it poor luigi
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:17.040]   poor luigi there was a there was a video company that ao wall bought called like 15 seconds or
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.960]   something like that like there there've been a lot of these types of things fiddly there's been a
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.760]   ton of these 12 second calm so few are good i mean the bottom line so few of these are good
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:34.320]   or worth watching it so i don't know taking the photo they were also chatting services right
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.880]   right then then doing good video good video is hard i mean being interest visual interestiness
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.840]   is hard and so i don't know i i think stop motion and things like that maybe if as the tools get
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:54.640]   better and people become better at short video um that's sort of the thing that's not out there
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:00.080]   video creation tools that that can make short videos interesting and worth watching and it
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.680]   maybe even contribute something is is the missing link flicker had 30 second videos taxicabs
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.760]   tell me in the chat room yeah but i think all of it is about getting the attention of young people
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:16.080]   right because um that's really where the battle's happening here isn't it what do we get the kids
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.960]   how do we get the kids to use it but the problem is the kids are fickle they went from my space to
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:27.760]   facebook to instagram to vine to snapchat they're fickle they'll use whatever other kids are using
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.720]   and and they're going to use what their parents aren't using they're right i mean that's what went
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.400]   wrong with facebook mom and dad well totally and and frankly my space at that point too i mean
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:44.800]   anytime anything becomes too popular i remember what it was like to be you know i joined icq um
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.880]   my numbers started with the ones i was like one of the very first part of the first group i see
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.800]   q users and when that became kind of you know inundated with tons of people you know you moved
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.400]   to other chat services and and i was a live journal user and and i had a bunch of other things but
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.760]   you don't want to be you want to be amongst your peers you don't want to be in an environment where
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.520]   everybody knows about it because that doesn't that's when you're young that's that's not what you
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:13.600]   want to do that's why snapchat i think is so ingenious and why people wouldn't want to use poke um so
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.920]   i think that the the the key though i mean facebook line instagram was so smart because
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:26.000]   they were basically understanding that instagram had a chance to be a real disruptor to facebook so
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.960]   you know create your own disruptor create your own product that's going to kill your other one
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.720]   rather than letting some other service come in and do it and that's just going to be the challenge
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.560]   i think moving forward is is for these companies to create the the piece of technology or the service
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:47.840]   that is going to put the other one out of business um and unfortunately that's a hard thing to kind
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:54.640]   of determine because it's fickle based on the users based on their ages based on the demographics so
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:02.480]   i don't know you're you're around 30 right Christina i'm 30 yeah 30 so uh you have you grew up in the
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.440]   internet era you were you know you were uh what do you remember the first thing you used to
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:13.840]   communicate with your friends yeah yeah i used i see q of course i see q yeah i use i see q and uh
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:19.360]   one eight four five six four five that was fine using a
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.760]   and i used uh i had juneo for email juneo yeah the free internet yeah
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.280]   a well the messenger became uh you didn't have to have an aol account when it opened up to everybody
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:35.520]   and i think that was in 97 okay that was that became huge so you as a teenager you were not
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.560]   on the phone with your friends no texting wasn't happening yet you were instant messaging
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   yeah no we were instant messaging actually how it usually worked is that we were on the phone with
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:52.640]   three way and then text then i aming people on on the uh dedicated computer you know line it was
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.120]   basically how it usually were remember going upstairs and my daughter who's younger than you but
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:04.720]   same kind of right thing she's doing her homework she's got three people on the line in a party call
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.520]   she's got instant message you're going and there's music playing yes and i thought what the hell
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:16.160]   didn't we all got pagers and so we would we would start to kind of mean black like blackberries
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:22.640]   no no no this was before that um just like regular pagers but you would just put in you know you
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.360]   would put in letters there was a way you could kind of write people almost using like you like a
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:33.440]   game it was like a text scene thing yeah wow totally uh and then once we all got cell phones you know um
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.120]   but of course minutes were expensive but yeah uh text messaging didn't really start until i was
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   in college right uh we were all over i am it was two early two thousands of people started text messaging
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.840]   yeah yeah and it really wasn't you because you couldn't go cross service you had to use that weird
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:53.920]   number pad you type a a b b b you know that kind of thing yeah it's fun it's fun to see how quickly
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   though this has changed and how rapidly changes and there's so there are people and i know a lot of
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.840]   them who say oh facebook's won you know i got a billion users they won yeah google's won no no
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:12.000]   no any wins i don't think of of course they're not you know what is defined winning right they're
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.280]   not going to be here until the end of time but certainly they're safe for a little while i think
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:24.480]   that that's uh reasonable to to think right yeah just like i see q well yeah possibly go
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:31.920]   wrong no one no one blackberry messenger is so huge no but come on i mean one big critical
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:38.160]   everyone everyone well okay everyone is on there everyone can quit from one minute to the next but
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.440]   there is something about a social network there is a critical mass yes the network effect with the
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:51.680]   yeah right right and and yes it could disappear it could uh you know uh weighing over time but it's
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.920]   going to take a while it's not like to know is it slowing down do you think
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:04.480]   certainly it is yeah down um yeah of course and and of course the the the kids the youngsters are
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:10.160]   interested in other things but that's what i see because i you know i love watching my kids and
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.800]   now they're too old i'm gonna have to find some new kids because because seriously because you watch
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.440]   them and they have no allegiance right brand means nothing to them they have no allegiance they just
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.160]   do what other kids do and a kid finds vine and everybody starts using vine within within three
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.280]   weeks the whole school is using vine it's just fascinating to watch these these they're like
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:35.440]   schools of fish they go boom but then are they gonna go to facebook after they're done with their
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.960]   experimental facebook's done for these kids are is it almost everybody i interact with on facebook
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.040]   is older than me yeah facebook's done for kids almost and that's what i mean facebook's in more
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:51.360]   trouble than people understand but but i mean i i agree with you for for the younger users but
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:57.040]   do you think that because the facebook has become ubiquitous enough that even if it's i mean i still
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.720]   think that they have to find a way to create um you know products that will resonate with with
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.400]   younger users and maybe even brand it differently or something um to have them use the service but
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:13.200]   do you think it's become ubiquitous enough with older people and and with you know the vast majority
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.560]   of internet users that um you know you feel forced you feel forced to use it it's kind of you know
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:25.600]   what yeah who was for a while or even even AOL using xp of social networks that may be but remember
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:32.640]   that the revenue comes from advertisers who for reasons i don't fully understand as an old man
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:38.480]   uh have a real passion for the eighteen to twenty five year old they want to reach that
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.360]   group they can't reach them through television they have disposable income they have disposable
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:47.120]   income so the people uh even me i i'm kind of aged out of that area but they they want to go after
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.240]   people i'm aged out of twenty five to fifty four i'm really i mean although i'm dual income no kids
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:57.520]   so i'm oh you're good you're a dink yeah oh i think that's pretty good but it's it's it's
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.760]   disposable income and uh that they form their their cage i want to just say i have a ton of freaking
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:10.960]   disposable income here but nobody's advertising except for viegra and depends nobody's trying to
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.440]   reach me speaking of which we're going to take a break because i got to go to the bathroom uh we

[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.160]   that wasn't in the uh was that last week does that last week or the week before i guess i guess
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.560]   we didn't get that in there you missed the elephant toothpaste that was this week yep that's like
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.080]   the thing that the big thing that happened this week yeah we we missed e3 last week too
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.880]   highlights what good are they don't know you really need to watch all of twit not just yeah the
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.240]   highlights not going to do it for you you know we're doing a new thing and Chad's been very good
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.680]   about this on our youtube channel youtube.com/twit we try to pick not not like a short highlight but
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   like a good moment from each show so you could see get a sense of what the shows are about
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.000]   that kind of thing and so if you go to youtube.com/twit you could see that and of course each show has
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.400]   its own channel on youtube which we now i think have figured out we don't get as many blocks
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.000]   as we used to right all right or if we get just as meaning we take it we can take them then we can
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.520]   put them back put them back all right are you gonna drink that bourbon now try to open it okay
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:12.960]   if i can open it so facebook uh i think has an issue with these 18 to 25 year olds reason they by
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.280]   the way they want young people's not merely disposable income but they get you at 18 they got you for
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.040]   life that's a lot longer they get me for life what do they got five years and it's done
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.720]   so there is a reason to go after these younger people facebook wanted to put video ads
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.880]   speak in instagram but it looks like even though they've been shopping these around to agencies
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.480]   the asking price for a day long video ad on facebook was in the seven figures
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   uh and they were selling demographics things like you want 18 to 34 year old women we we can do that
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.400]   um but it looks like it's going to be delayed all i'm so disappointed
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:58.080]   uh the launch has been pushed back to early fall according to advertising age at age
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.920]   um not sure why i think perhaps there's some nervousness at facebook's part that they don't really
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.280]   know how people are going to react to this a million bucks they were asking as much as 2.4
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.160]   million dollars for an ad that be seen by all us based facebook users so i mean we're talking
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:21.040]   super bowl money for this uh the question is how they'll work audio won't be activated until a
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:30.240]   user unless a user clicks on the 15 second ad uh-huh uh-huh at which point it will restart and spread
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.720]   like a cancer over the right and left hand rails of the page you i added the like a cancer that
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.920]   wasn't a mad age um so the video will appear if you're targeted in your news feed up to
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:50.640]   three times on the day they're slotted so you go and you come back it's still there
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:58.960]   and it plays silently uh then it spreads from the news feed um wow people hate people hate this
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.560]   kind of stuff i mean working for a site where we where we have um we do lots of ads right and we
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:10.000]   charge a lot for for takeovers and all that for the reason that we know a lot of people hate them
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.040]   and they're gonna sort of click off but you still do them but we still offer them but we you know
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:22.240]   we charge a lot because you know you're you're infringing on on people's time um in order to offer
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:26.640]   it so i am not gonna ever knock anybody we do ads we do big ads we take over the takeover we
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.160]   stop the whole show and start doing an ad which i'm about to do in a minute um but but you got to
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:38.560]   pay for this stuff right you either charge people directly or you put ads in yep um and you knew
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.800]   facebook was gonna have to do this that they they've been um cultivating users for a long time and
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.880]   and under uh advertising to them to to a degree and you knew this stuff was coming and so nobody
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.400]   can be surprised by it nobody should be um but they are going to be put out by it users always are
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.520]   it you know everybody's time is valuable and attention is is is very valuable
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.560]   never before in video uh seen before video of steve jobs in 1994
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.240]   um oh i need the flash player
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.520]   i am really i so i got the new macbook here and i'm really doing everything i can not to install
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.520]   flash in this macbook here let me turn on the html5 on youtube and see if i can i can play it then
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:34.880]   uh jim dalrymple of the loop published uh this i think so that's the one where he says uh
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.240]   that basically oh sorry you have it up okay here it goes from an interview he made while he was
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.000]   at next in 1994 and this is from the silicon valley uh historical society i have done it's
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.040]   a very strange business and a very strange endeavor of life all the work that i have done in my life
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:08:00.560]   will be obsolete by the time i'm you know 50 apple two's obsolete now apple ones were obsolete many
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.360]   years ago the mac and tosh is on the verge of becoming obsolete the next few years oh god it's
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:14.320]   heaven for fenned this is a field where one does not write a principia which holds up for 200 years
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.640]   this is not a field where one paints a painting that'll be looked at for centuries or builds a
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:25.600]   church uh that will be admired and you know looked at an astonishment for centuries no
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.360]   this is a field where one does one's work and in ten years it's it's obsolete
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.600]   and really will not be usable within ten or twenty years i mean you can't go back and use an apple
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.440]   one because there's no software for it and another ten years or so you won't be able to use an apple
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.720]   two you wouldn't be able to fire it up and see what it was like so it's it's sort of like uh
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.400]   it's sort of like sediment of rocks i mean you're building up a mountain and you get to contribute
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.080]   your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher but no one on the
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.160]   surface will unless they have x-ray vision we'll see your sentiment they'll stand on it
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.400]   it'll you know it'll be appreciated by that rare geologist but
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:09.280]   no it's not like the renaissance at all it's very different you feel a little sadness there too don't
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.040]   you like he kind of he knows that he's building a legacy but a legacy that won't won't last forever
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:23.120]   principia's an isic newton reference by the way wow i missed that that's uh wow you know laws that
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.560]   are going to be uh that people are going to be talking about for generations that are going to
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:35.360]   yeah right great reference he was he was certainly right in what he was saying at that point in his
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:42.960]   career i think now he he will remain at least in in he has this image of the you know the the greatest
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:50.400]   second act of entrepreneurship history in america or the world there's there's
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.080]   he was probably at a time at next where he felt maybe you know i've done what i could do and that's
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:04.480]   gonna be forgotten now he's come back and done iTunes and and uh you know the iPhone and iPad
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:12.320]   obviously so he might have had a different uh a few different things to say if we redid the
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.000]   interview now or i think that's right i think and even if you look at his comments right after he
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.200]   joined apple he that's pretty consistent with things that he was still saying i mean i
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.400]   he still obviously had the ambition to do big things but he was kind of wondering if it was still
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.160]   over for apple or what else there was to do and both the internet and and then sort of post pc
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.120]   device um you know regenerated i think the possibilities and obviously some of the things that they did
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:48.320]   helped helped that obviously yeah he's go ahead i was gonna say uh right after he he passed away
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.600]   john laster was on charlie rose and they're talking about him and charlie rose mentioned that
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:00.960]   about you know maybe 12 months before um he rejoined apple or about this time he was doing
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.240]   you know press for for toy story he was talking to charlie and and basically was kind of lamenting
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.320]   the fact that he he couldn't go back in and save apple and kind of correct the ship and
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.040]   and it seemed to be um that's what uh robert ex cringley said too and um kind of you know that
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.520]   the lost interview of steve jobs from the the unedited company used for for trying off of the
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.280]   nerds was that he had the sense that you know if i knew what i know now if i could go back
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.040]   and do it over again things would be different but i i do get the sense that at least probably
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.640]   when that video was the video that we just played was done and and you know pre-end of 96 he probably
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.560]   had figured my moment of real you know impact is over and i'm not going to have a chance again
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.000]   and then of course that that changed you know for to it is for everyone but that changed but i
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.240]   get the sense that he very much was kind of of the opinion that no matter what he might do
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.600]   and and what impact he however he might be seen in the guise of history was passed
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:02.800]   and uh obviously it wasn't yeah i'm not so sure i mean we remember tomas edison although most
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:10.160]   of his stuff is uh out of date i guess um we maybe you know but it's not like you know it's
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.360]   ironic because you know who stuff will last pixar stuff john lasseter stuff will last
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.360]   uh a lot longer than an apple too or a macintosh so but do you think that we would look back as
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.960]   fondly on apple like let's say that yeah he hadn't come back that uh the what's his face um the um
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.440]   bill amelio the one we try to forget he who shall not be named bill amelio yes whose book i read
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.120]   last year uh that he wrote after he was fired from apple which he said i did it all
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.560]   oh yeah i know jobs is just following after everything i invented
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.760]   exactly it was it was one of the best books i've already it was so completely hilarious um
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.640]   i recommended to anyone like 500 days at the fire or something like that like it's fabulous
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:59.680]   get it off of amazon for like two dollars so good um but uh it's so funny um but uh you know if
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.880]   amelio had not been fired and if seajaps hadn't come back and amelio had you know run it into
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.360]   the ground would we look back do you think today at apple and you see it with these
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.800]   similar sunglasses or would it be something like palm would be like a tari or absolutely
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.440]   and you see amiga amiga is great you know palador where we would look back and we would think
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.920]   yeah that was great but like you know history is is one by the victors right and part of the
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.080]   reason we look back on edison and and he won is because you know he won you know tesla might
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.240]   have had better technology but edison won um and so right yeah so if we had if he hadn't been
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.360]   able to come back and have that second act i do i i mean you know i i do think maybe he was on
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.440]   the something i mean i think pixar would have lasted him and would have given him a legacy but
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.600]   you know next in apple if he hadn't come back and if apple hadn't been able to be righted i
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.680]   i do think that we probably would be looking back at it now in the sense that oh it had
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.720]   potential but we wouldn't be you know creating this mythology around it and it wouldn't have
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:02.000]   you know the onus of being you know the first you know major you know mainstream you know graphical
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.120]   user interface and and the first real um personal computer i i think that we would probably that's
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.400]   a good point you know he popularized that didn't he that's a very good point he did yeah he did you
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.800]   know he did he as he said when he introduced the iphone he he revolutionized a few things the first
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:26.560]   one was the mac the computer with the mac uh and then you had iTunes which was which revolutionized
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.840]   the music industry and the iphone and the ipad of course um but i think there's another uh
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.840]   aspect of the of the second uh period of steve jobs which makes it a lot more impactful than it
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:45.760]   had been until then uh and it's the internet in the sense that we all could see the keynotes where
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:53.840]   he has a quality you know the the reality distortion field was spread over so many more people who
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:02.000]   could experience the the bask in the glorious uh light of steve jobs uh and be influenced by his
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.320]   weird uh karisma i think that also plays a role because everyone knows and remembers this now where
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.560]   back in the at the time of the mac it was just the people who were in the room with him so that
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.880]   that might also have a role i think that's fair all right we're gonna take a break when we come
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.920]   back i'll show you a different side of steve jobs the trailer from the ashton kutcher movie
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:34.720]   compare and contrast ladies and gentlemen but first a word from uh stamps.com stamps.com is a place
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.920]   to go if you need postage you're not the post office no why go to the post office when you could
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.440]   print all the postage you need anytime of the day or night 24/7 without a trip to the post office
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.960]   it's stamps.com uh stamps.com by the way is not a postage meter i think sometimes people think oh
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.920]   yeah i i know about that no in fact a postage meter costs a whole heck of a lot more
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.800]   and is not nearly as convening convenience stamps.com did you know i didn't know this postage meter ink
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.680]   is a hundred times more expensive than inkjet ink which is already ridiculously priced uh

[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.560]   get it people have yelled at me on twitter and they said no no no how can you say what's real what's
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:54.960]   fake i'm like watch saying bye just watch you tell me what's yes seriously one is one is written by
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.240]   erin sorkin and produced by scott ruden and one is this not that that's going to be more accurate but
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.560]   let but this is this is a howler here's a ashton kutcher as steve jobs
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:15.280]   steve it takes guts to drop out like you did higher education comes at the expense experience
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:22.640]   was what do you work out to computer terminals that holds up to the tv from the display
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:34.800]   i do like this uh steve wow it only takes one person these are state of the art nobody's making
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:46.320]   anything like this start okay welcome to apple computer this is everything start up i think
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.720]   we should start with around 90 grand uh could you repeat that if you'll have me bored
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:19:00.800]   inspired by true events not actual truth i don't know i might want to see this we got to make
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:07.040]   you know those things unforgettable typeface that isn't a pressing issue get out that i like too i
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.160]   think that's not that i think it's been doing the impossible ever since it was in a garage i'm
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.360]   trying to build apple and they're taking it away from me if you keep heading down this path i will
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.680]   not protect you it's a blatant rip-off i'm gonna sue you for every step you are your own
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.560]   worst enemy the board is unanimous steve will no longer be involved in this company
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:42.720]   ten years after steve jobs departure the future of apple computer is in jeopardy in life you only
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.400]   get to do so many things we're making apple cool again
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:57.200]   so i guess it brings some easy points the garage right up to the uh mind that is returned
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.640]   yeah they they lied about their scope of it they originally say no it's just gonna be about you know
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.560]   his visions on life and this and that and then they were like no we can totally make the scope
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:13.600]   biopic it's called jobs just jobs you know those like books that they're like the reductionist
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:22.000]   books that you see from face-related computers i just hate was i know that guy's a good actor i
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.600]   liked him and lost but i just he's not was it's not him is it the guy from loss isn't it i don't
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.200]   know some fat guy with a beard they all look the same you know it's not the guy from loss it's
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.400]   the guy from love another drugs that all right that jake jalen home v i like him too but it's he's
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:45.920]   not was it's not even close anyone else loved they're using the the music from the windows eight ads
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:52.640]   is it really yes that's kind of tone deaths oh oh well this whole production company is tone
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.440]   death uh can i go on a rant real quick about why i all right all right why do you hate this movie
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.840]   chris dina warren the reason i hate this movie is because a i can tell you already it's probably
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   gonna be terrible um because anytime it's been delayed it got picked up at sundance i realized
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.960]   but anytime you delay a film and you push it back and it's not going from like the dead zone release
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:17.600]   period to um something more advantageous it's because you're not going to be able to to sell
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.880]   it that well um but beyond that when they were doing when they were shooting this film the the
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.560]   production company reached out to us and offered us the opportunity and they did this for some
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.760]   other reporters too and some people took them up on it and said you could be an extra on the film
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:38.400]   um if you come out here and write a story about it and the only way we'll get it but we won't give
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:44.080]   you any access to the actors the director of the crew but you can be an extra and then you need to
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.080]   write a story about this so first of all the way that set visits always work is that uh the
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.920]   journalists but film journalists is that um and i've been a film journalist before is that you
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.680]   actually get access to be able to talk to crew members cast members see production you are not
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.280]   bribed to write an article by being an extra and you are certainly not told that you can't have any
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.040]   interaction with the cast or crew and so to me that was the impetus of that was going okay well
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:17.680]   this entire production is is really really slimy if they're trying to you know get pressed this way
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.480]   and and not to go the the way that it's always done but try to basically bribe people into
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.560]   into writing stories by saying oh but but you but you can't interview anybody who's part of it and
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:33.360]   we're not going to give you an in exclusives so it's a pretty amateur movie it's at best it's
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.480]   gonna be at best it'll be a tv movie quality at best yeah i mean you know look ashton looks a lot
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   like steve jobs that's great that's about it right they got a guy who looks like steve jobs
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.000]   it's like there's a real movie from oscar winners right like being produced
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.240]   wasniak had two words for it he said atrocious and awful
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.400]   not for the trailer he read the script he said awful and atrocious
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.400]   when you look at it what i was saying was the um you know those books you see that are like
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.840]   for young adults of biography yeah yeah yeah frankly and all they take these things and they
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.480]   reduce them to these platitudes right they take something really complicated that happened like
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.360]   you know the founding of the constitution right and they reduce it to a platitude and that's i feel
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.800]   like this whole movie like all the dialogue that we see is like a sort of a platitude that you would
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.560]   reduce it to like a 10 to 12 year old on what the you know founding of apple computer and the life
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.760]   of steve jobs meant you know that's what this whole thing sounds like you know every bit of it yeah
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.680]   but you think but i don't i don't i oh sorry i'm a delicious man you do movie stuff too so yeah
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.240]   we'll let you do yeah actually actually i saw the bling ring and hated it i was very
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.560]   disappointed oh i love sofia kapola i liked it i liked it i i love sofia kapola but i want to
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.280]   show you this is the job this is the steve jobs i know
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   six seasons
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:01.520]   that's steve one i mean that that's was i should say that's the was i know doing the fish or the worm on
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:09.280]   the uh dancing with the stars but you know the i love sorcan and i adore the west wing but he
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:16.080]   i'm not sure he watched facebook yeah yeah exactly i mean i i think that was good but you can't really
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.520]   rely on him for for historical accuracy i don't think he likes technology that's that's part of the
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:28.240]   problem with erin sorcan he hates computers yeah he does i'm not sure we're gonna get a very uh
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:35.520]   accurate depiction of steve jobs his life with with his movie and and quite frankly as you're saying
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.800]   jason the only way to to get out of the platitudes is probably to read you know two or three or four
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.920]   books about the guy to understand exactly what he was what he was like so do you guys think the
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.760]   isex in book was good i liked it yeah i liked it there were good things in it i think it's a good
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:25:00.160]   start um i think people will launch off of that and do better work um his instagram historians on
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.520]   on steve jobs they'll you know you know the thing is is he was doing a lot right he was trying to cover
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:12.240]   a lot in that and so i think people will do better work historically um going back by delving into
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.800]   certain pieces of it right like the the whole iTunes entertainment thing um somebody should
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.120]   write you can write a book about that that that was a thing um you can write their books and there
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.080]   have been a number of good books um maybe not a definitive one yet on the early sort of steve
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:33.200]   jobs first in at apple um so i i think isex in there's some gaps there's some lack of analysis on
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.880]   some important stuff um but but i but i think it's a solid first start and isex in you can tell that
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.120]   he had to do this and he was doing it quickly and to try to get it out right he was kind of racing
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:48.080]   against time because if you look at his books that he did on franklin on einstein he did the kind
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:54.560]   of analysis that sort of good historians do and biographers um and he talks about in the interviews
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.640]   he talked about the fact that the great thing with steve's life is like these things were happening
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.040]   he was and he was involved when steve um had that last interview with uh or that last meeting with
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   people at apple he said he called him that was the last call that he had the last interview
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:16.960]   steve jobs called him literally right after and um and told him what happened in his perspective on
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.080]   it and the great thing he said he talked to four other people that were in that room and got um
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.040]   and got their perspective on it and they said completely different things like they all came
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.960]   away and he said i couldn't do that going back to einstein i couldn't talk about you know what
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:36.400]   you know after he sent the letter to um rosavald um and and talk to him i could i could never get
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.680]   that kind of perspective so i think that's the best stuff in the book is the stuff at the very end
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.600]   where uh isexson had a unique perspective on on what was there and i think other historians
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:55.040]   will build on that work my my big request is that walter isexson released the tapes of the many
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.240]   hours of interviews here with jobs because isexson himself was you know he was a little new to this he
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.000]   was a little green he was obviously not very tech savvy he made some dumb mistakes
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.640]   but the but the raw materials need to be released to historians and then you know that's a big part
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.400]   of it is that he got access when nobody else did yeah and he's a true he is a true historian and so
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.840]   i have to think that he already has plans for his notes and his tapes and all of that to go into an
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.880]   archives at some point in time i have to think that that was part of the agreement with jobs was
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.960]   him saying look when i'm done with this or when i die or whatever the time is time frame this
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:38.320]   stuff is going to be donated to the library of congress to you know some library you know new
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.440]   york live it's really valuable stuff and it shouldn't be it shouldn't go with with walter
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.600]   yes yeah no i i'm totally with jason i think that the the biggest asset was that he had all
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.640]   of that access to him and if those tapes or something could be turned over then we would
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.320]   probably be able to wind up with a much more in-depth book that's much more nuanced yeah
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.960]   we don't know much about what's apples gonna do with a new iphone some uh rumored pictures
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:14.480]   mac rumors says they got photos of what are the rear shell of the uh five s or whatever apple
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.520]   decides to call the september version of the iphone five looks a lot like the old iphone in fact i
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:26.000]   don't think you can really tell much from these pictures at all um a redesigned rear shell according
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:34.240]   to mac rumors uh making room for a larger dual led flash cut out okay uh maybe a higher resolution
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:40.560]   camera apple's been experimenting apparently with 12 and 13 megapixel cameras a night shooting mode
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.760]   perhaps um i guess we're just gonna have to wait and see apple has really did uh done a much
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.080]   better job tim cook last year at all things d said we're gonna double down on secrecy
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.160]   and i think the fact that we knew absolutely nothing about what apple was gonna announce
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.760]   at wwdc shows that he has done that and we have nothing uh on the next iphone anybody
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:09.920]   thoughts nfc fingerprint technology yeah there was this this fingerprinting rumor thing that was
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:15.840]   floating around i'm you know i've been really wondering i'm still using an iphone uh i think i'm
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.440]   gonna keep using an iphone i just like the simplicity uh but i'm really wondering what they could do
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:29.360]   to make it make it become a super compelling device for everyone like to give it a leg up
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.440]   and i don't i can't imagine what could what they could uh add to the iphone that would make it
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:44.320]   better than the alternative um i i just don't see what uh i can't imagine what what could interest me
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:52.160]   in uh in that way so i'm not sure i mean mobile payments is is big right we're still sort of waiting
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:59.200]   for its moment um i i don't know that the uh i don't know that the next iphone is gonna be it
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:05.520]   i i don't think they want to go with nfc and fc is a battery it still has battery problems um i
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:12.640]   think they want to try to do it with uh bluetooth 4.0 or or something um i you know it's it's one of the
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:18.960]   it's an itunes kind of situation as well right there's a lot of competing interests and trying
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:25.760]   to get everybody on board on a on a standard or at least a uh a method of working together is tough
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.280]   if anybody can do it apple is certainly positioned to be able to do it i think it's one of the reasons
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.120]   that i think they are gonna do it and they have plans to do it as they brag all in all of these
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:40.080]   you know they talk about how many credit cards they have right right right right that's a really
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.560]   or something yeah yeah they're they're they are telegraphing every time that we're working on
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.200]   online payments every time they say that know that they're telling you we're working on the world's
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.120]   greatest you know electronic payment system or just stay out of our way because one of these days
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:31:00.960]   we might do that exactly that exactly uh let's take a break when we come back uh we will talk about
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:07.760]   john macafee or macafee i now at least know how to pronounce his name if very little else um
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.520]   we can also talk about uh the big i think the big story when it buried the lead
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:19.040]   they're calling it the xbox 180 microsoft backs down on everything uh but first a word from square

[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.360]   one of the neat things you get a mobile store as part of the deal when you get the square space
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.760]   commerce package look at the pricing because uh that's the other thing it's pretty remarkable

[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.040]   how nice it is to use a square space ipad or iphone app and uh or the website all CMSs suck
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.880]   but some suck a little less than us yeah yeah they've done they they understand that they really
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.240]   done it right um i have the new macbook here in front of me a lot of people complaining about
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.360]   wifi connectivity issues i have noticed it works really well with the apple new apple airport
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:18.400]   extreme no problems there i didn't have any problems with my review yet but um but i but like you i've
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:23.280]   been seeing people commenting that it's been losing yeah i've noticed that when i'm in my office it
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.800]   drops a lot and i think that this doesn't do as well with weak wifi apple has historically had problems
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:35.280]   uh with uh DHCP leases and things they've had problems with their ipad it's it's funny it's
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.200]   almost new apple product wifi problems are almost you know especially the air for some reason the
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:47.280]   last two airs yeah we tested and i had wifi the same wifi problem with both of them and in both
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.800]   cases first patch fixed it yeah they were able to fix it in software but so it's not a hardware
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:58.640]   issue or at least it hasn't been in the past it's an affirmware fix almost always seems to fix it
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.600]   um according to ours technica uh one user says every 15 to 30 minutes it just drops off turn the
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:12.480]   wifi off and on again it's fine um i don't i don't know what it is it's maybe a heating problem
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:18.800]   gizmodo says it's worse when the computer's on a desk i have mind's been really reliable again
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:25.600]   with the airport extreme in here we have flaky wifi i have had quite a few drops not in here it's
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.480]   been fine in here it's in my office so i'm thinking maybe if it's a marginal signal it's it's a bigger
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.600]   problem though on the other hand it's a nice it's exactly like the old back book here
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.800]   it's even a little slower just with twice the battery life yeah the battery's insane
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.400]   it's great battery life i'll testify for that but it's a little slower looks exactly it's got two
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.880]   microphones so two holes um is it slow or are you getting for battery life i'm a slower yeah it's
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.680]   got a well the clock speed slower and so it's coming out oh you know it turbos the same it turbos the
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.560]   same the turbos the same the clock speed's a little bit lower and it's more power efficient in my
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.800]   my side-by-side test and i my main like everyday use laptop is the 2012 macbook air i really didn't
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.960]   notice any difference between the two in terms of speed it's functionally the same in synthetic
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.680]   tests yeah it might be a little slower at some things but then the gpu is faster and the ssd is
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.800]   faster so that overcompensates in some cases right so i have this weird thing this maybe just
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.600]   be me and i've never i've been not being able to confirm this the 2011 macbook air
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.920]   wait woke from sleep faster than either 20 oh i got a fix for you for 2013 do you have the fix for this
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:40.400]   i do because i've applied it to this apple on both the macbook retina and the macbook air
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:47.360]   puts it into a deeper sleep mode and has to load in and so there's this like 13 second and then
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:54.320]   you can type right yes very frustrating uh rene richie told me about this we're so spoiled right
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.160]   you expected that was the one thing i always loved about the macbook air you flip the lid open
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.440]   you yeah type in right away so if you don't if you don't mind that you're going to lose some battery
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:08.320]   life when it's sleeping because in order to get better battery life what they did is they they
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:16.080]   yeah they made it to a deeper sleep okay you can fix this there's a website e w a l dot net
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.560]   fixing slow wake for macbook pro with rent display it turns out it's on the air and the new
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:28.640]   air especially i found it and you'll do a come a terminal command pm set which is a power manager
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:34.480]   command so uh you can see go open terminal see what your settings are with pm set dash g
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:42.080]   pm set dash a will change the stand you can change the stand by delay
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.480]   uh in this example he said it to a 24 hours p you have to it's a pseudo command so you have to
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.880]   pseudo yeah somebody in this front row is doing it right now you're ready type along with me
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:59.520]   s u d o space you got terminal he's waiting it's waking up isn't it annoying
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:04.480]   because that's the best thing about heirs and and macbooks in general is you open them up and
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.440]   they're ready to go boom so everybody's getting theirs out pseudo sudo sudo sudo spes pm set
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:18.880]   that's power managing management settings space dash a space stand by delay and then set it for
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.000]   the number of seconds you want 86,400 seconds it's 24 hours i haven't found it makes that much
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.400]   difference in battery life if you really want it to you know after a day it will go into deeper
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.800]   sleep then hit return you'll have to log in of course because you need to be an administrator to
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:40.640]   do this that's the pseudo and it just then it wakes up thank you mose it wakes right up thank you
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.480]   tell me it's we're right in article about this like tech republic well thank rene richie if i'm
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.760]   more he's the one now i put it to sleep and it's not waking up at all but that's uh
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:55.280]   that's another my seat woke up right away didn't it yeah it works all right we have a front row
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:03.440]   tester he's born in texas so you know he's honest seriously mine's now dead oh you're seeing i can
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:08.880]   see it so i think it decided to go into the clamshell mode and oh it's in clamshell mode so just unplug
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.160]   the that's because uh we have a uh an adapter you're right exactly right wow that's interesting
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:22.000]   so as i closed it it said oh you're on a big screen all right now i don't know what's going on all
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.520]   right there we go uh sorry about that with little tech support there for Jason but i think it's
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.840]   very important that everybody gets this thank you can we give a shout out to uh an another story
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   request could we give a shout out to um uh or not even a shout out so much but an rip to Ed yackabuchi
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.400]   from citric yeah thank you for mentioning that it is uh i've known Ed for years
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:49.440]   um and he passed away of he had actually pancreatic cancer survived almost a year and a half
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.920]   which is very unusual for a serious cancer like that that's isn't that what steve jobs had to isn't
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.600]   it uh but he passed away recently it was only 59 very young guy but let's tell you who Ed yackabuchi
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:09.760]   was he uh he was an engineer at IBM working on the uh new IBM PC he uh was writing OS 2
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:17.920]   when he was part of a very famous swap brain swap with microsoft OS 2 engineers went to Redmond
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:24.480]   to work on NT and microsoft engineers went over to IBM to armonk to work or maybe it was bokeh to work
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:31.520]   on OS 2 remember OS 2 had windows built in remember that uh so Ed ended up writing apparently uh
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.000]   according to urban legend which i think is true much of the code for windows their first windows
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.080]   NT kernel and learned so much about the innards of it that he was able to then create uh the best
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.640]   remote desktop product is one that's still widely used in enterprise called citrix founded citrix
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:53.760]   in 1989 uh ran the company for about 10 years maybe more and uh uh went on other things citrix by
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:59.280]   the way is a very big sponsor i'm sure of many of your sites as well as ours um they're they really
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.840]   they really contribute back to the web in fact i think if uh in many ways twit wouldn't exist if
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.960]   citrix weren't such a big sponsor uh one of the good guys there really are one of the good guys
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.720]   Ed left he started net jets remember that was a time share for uh corporate jets and other things
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.320]   but uh really a great guy uh one of the most beloved figures did you run into him Jason did you know
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:28.080]   him um i know it was it was a little bit before my time um but uh i'm a fan you know know the story
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:34.400]   and um fan of the work that he did at citrix and he was trying to do it the right way too um
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:41.120]   jina smith on a new domain.net had won a really nice um little memorial article she stayed in
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.360]   touch with that she had introduced me to Ed and we piled around a convex that's how long ago this
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:52.320]   was uh quite a bit and ed was always fun just a nice sweet guy um and so yeah
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.800]   jina would be a good that'd be a good obituary to read because she was good friends with it she
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.960]   knew him yes i'll post that article on twitter um but but yeah that's um he and she talked about
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.920]   the fact where he had done yeah you there you go you got it uh um where she where he had done
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.080]   some of this is really important work at the time um and and it was contentious right the os
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:17.760]   two microsoft thing and the cool thing which shows i think how pragmatic ed was and and probably a
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:24.160]   little bit uh you know what a good leader he was he later went back to microsoft and worked with them
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:31.120]   very uh effectively um with from uh from the point of view of citrix because they signed an
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.000]   important agreement that that really set the groundwork for some of the things that went into
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.920]   windows that you know predated really as we were getting into virtualization and cloud computing
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.600]   and all of that a lot of the work that citrix did um and microsoft then first partnered with and then
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:53.920]   sort of emulated that well our rdp is licensed for citrix remote desktop is a citrix yes product
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:00.080]   nobody did it nobody did remote desktop better and microsoft was wise i think to uh to invest yeah
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.640]   and a lot of that technology was laid the groundwork for some of the stuff that's really
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.480]   important to what we're doing today with virtualization and cloud computing and and other stuff in
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:15.440]   enterprise as well so uh so he so he definitely deserves a hat tip from from all of us yeah yeah
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.880]   i'm glad you reminded me i almost forgot and and um having been lucky enough to know it he really
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.720]   was a sweetheart he's you know sometimes in this business you meet business guys who are cut throat
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.160]   or um uh you know aggressive or sometimes a lot of times you meet people like steve jobs
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.800]   uh who think they're the smartest guy in the room of course steve was right but uh they let
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.880]   you know it uh not ed he was often the smartest guy in the room but always very unassuming and real
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:49.120]   and genuine and fun to be with so thank you Jason for reminding me wouldn't want to miss that yeah
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:57.760]   and he will be missed gosh 59 seems very young to me yeah wonder why um let's see what else
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:07.120]   um tim cook to go from the charismatic ed yackaboochie and steve jobs to tim
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   tim i'm sure is a great manager he's not mr karisma not mr karisma uh he has uh changed his
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:24.160]   bonus stock to be more performance oriented uh actually was his request so originally he was
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.480]   going to be awarded a million stock units uh two lumps sums over ten years it's now a
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.800]   performance based compensation i like the confidence of a guy who says you know what
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:40.560]   let's do this right if i do good i make money if i don't i don't um so he'll get 100,000 units in
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:48.720]   august 2016 another 100,000 in 2021 the remaining 800,000 will be uh allocated over 10 years
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:55.360]   uh depending on how well he uh had the company does so that's good that's good look there's
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.160]   there's a lot of ways to lead you know and that's the way to do it isn't it not everybody has to be
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.480]   a steve jobs right not everybody has isn't that yackaboochie either right a very sort of humble
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.760]   leader that's a different model but but this is sort of i think it is the right way you know you
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.440]   should be rewarded only when you do well all the sort of golden parachutes and other things that
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.840]   that leaders do today to only protect themselves and not protect their companies um it is not
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.880]   always great and it's not a good model like this is a good model if he performs he does well if he
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:31.840]   doesn't you know they'll move on and so will he i have a lot of respect for him although after
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.520]   wwdc it seems like the superstar in terms of presentation is a great federiki wasn't he good
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.320]   oh he was amazing he was amazing i was i was really excited to see that they gave him a chance to
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:46.480]   shine because of past events he would maybe get a little bit of time but it was always the scott
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.840]   forestall show and and scott you know what wasn't that great of a presenter and kreg was awesome
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.000]   i mean he was really riveting and and we were all talking while we were watching the live streams
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.600]   in our office and and it was funny it's one of those things i was turning to one of our business
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.280]   reporters and he was like who was that guy i was like that's kreg and and uh we were like yeah he's
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.920]   he's amazing and i definitely think that after that showing he's he should be there like he
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:17.200]   prisoner from now on yeah very impressive he was funny too he was it was a very different vibe right
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:24.640]   yeah yeah no he he had great personality but you almost never see and even the best demos it's
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.880]   rare to see someone who has just a really good sense of humor and a good sense the crowd and just
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.000]   it's congenial and you know and it was different you know steve obviously had the charisma and the
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.400]   polish but he was just a really comfortable presenter and and seemed perfectly at home with with the
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:46.160]   audience so the last telegram ever will be sent in india next month
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:54.320]   can you believe that telegram's dead um well the the stories and that they're
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.680]   sending the last one it's that they were still sending they were still sending them at all
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:05.840]   it's true yeah 160 years ago samuel more sent the first telegram in 1844
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:15.360]   and uh that creator of morse code and uh apparently uh indian state run telecommunications company
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.160]   continues to send telegrams they're losing 23 million dollars a year on it
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:27.360]   five thousand telegrams are sent a day in india but considering the population that's not that many
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.480]   most of them are sent by the government
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:40.640]   so that's it the last telegram western units got out of the telegraph business in 2006
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:47.840]   uh it does feel weird that this is actually a technology that is dying i mean
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.400]   it it of course it happens all the time but it's so closely like it's the the the
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:00.160]   dinosaur of what we do today of the internet it's the first telecommunication and it's
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.560]   it's actually disappearing it's it's not going to be it yeah it's it feels i don't know why but it
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:13.520]   feels strange well before there was asky there was morse code um it really is a precursor in many
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:21.440]   ways of what we do today um yeah so i think it's appropriate to to markets uh it's changed yeah
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.160]   samuel morse also created one of the greatest paintings in american history is that funny yeah
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.160]   he's amazing painter he gave up painting gallery of the louvre by samuel morris when he was painting
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.880]   it's an american history yeah it's a very strange you know i found out about that in um
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:42.080]   david michael's book yeah david mccullis book about americans who went to paris
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.160]   yeah he was one of them and a great painter and then he gave it up
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.200]   and then what's the way he tells the story of morris code how it came about i forgot what it was
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.800]   it was actually he got that from france in france to french invented it yeah yeah you know it was the
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:03.600]   signal fires wasn't it it was signal fires so yes that's a big leap but they would say they would
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:08.880]   so if they you know the invaders the uh the uh the the uh anglo sachsins are coming across
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.240]   they would light the signal fire at shareborg and then it would go and they would i guess they
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.120]   would do i don't know there would be some sort of code and he saw that he said boy i wonder if you
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.160]   could use that maybe maybe we could do a telegraphs i don't know
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:27.120]   dots and dashes and there's the painting and the reason it's an interesting painting is because
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:35.920]   of all the people in it yes that's his over on the left um the one the guy painting is that the
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:42.000]   i think that's the guy he's very famous american sculptor in the back is james with his family
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.800]   he's james fennimore cooper uh in the back corner the the deer slayer yeah and um last of the
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:55.040]   mohekins yep um this is supposedly his daughter or or that he's leaning this is actually him in the
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:00.960]   center of the the paint the portrait is him leaning over the shoulder that's his daughter um who is
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:07.680]   also a portrait painter um i wish we had an audible ad that today because this is such a great book
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:13.040]   it is a great book and i read it on audible and this is the the mona lisa's in here too which is
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:17.440]   interesting this is before the mona lisa was she was known as a it was known as a very important
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.880]   da Vinci painting but it was not the she was not the international superstar that she was yet because
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:28.080]   you know what made her an international superstar was was she was stolen in the early 1900s right
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:33.200]   and um that's when she became and she was missing for two years out of the louvre right and so
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:39.760]   that's when she became an international icon um and so but he wisely uh had her in there and that's
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:44.480]   as a sort of a tortoise and renaissance painting the the ones that he put in these weren't the real
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:49.840]   paintings that were in this room he actually put them there um he went found his best
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:56.480]   favorite ones in the louvre put them in there and um and the great thing is now that gallery um that
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:02.240]   that's there that actually is their gallery of renaissance paintings today it's amazing and
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:08.240]   cool samuel fp morse not only painted that painting but invented telegrify and by the way we should
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:14.160]   point out morse code is still widely used just because telegrify's gone many many hams use cw
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:20.160]   morse code is still very much in use and it's a great way to break through when there's bad radio
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:27.600]   noise you can break through if if we if he was inspired by the french uh smoke signals of some
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.120]   kind you all owe us a lot of money yeah where's your uh where's your royalty it's good thing you
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:41.840]   didn't patent that i was gonna say the book is uh we have prior art yeah yeah this is the same
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.240]   period where where um charles dickens was coming to america and telling you know really ticked
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.600]   off basically did this tour was really ticked off because all the printers here were printing his
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.120]   books and that's right in the mokut of the the pro-sits it's right the the more things changed the more
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:02.000]   they remain the same or as you would say la plusa shange the mmm shows the greater journey americans
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.960]   and paris is a really it's a surprising subject but it's a fascinating you know that's where the
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:13.920]   great medical schools were yeah so all the doctors in the uh 19th century uh went to paris that part
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:18.800]   with morris and james fennimore cooper who became really good friends there that's my favorite part
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.960]   of that book that book is really kind of a it's almost like a collection of different stories of
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.960]   people and there's a lot of great stuff in there but that the part with morris and cooper is really
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:30.400]   spectacular you know what else we stole from you the cross sandwich
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:40.720]   i'm not i wouldn't say you stole it from us let's say it was inspired by real events is that how you
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.160]   you know inspired or yeah it was a fair trade for that what was it the l'oirel
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:54.240]   royal cheese the royal cheese well actually i will take that trade i love my god
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:02.320]   okay that's sad uh too much information google fiberspawns startup renaissance in
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:12.820]   kansas city according to margarita r
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:19.120]   i think this is what google wanted to approve really um homes for hackers project
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.160]   i think startup village inside kansas city i think that's fabulous they couldn't have scripted
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.880]   this any better right just what you want to scripted that yeah right that's exactly what they
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.880]   were hoping would happen so let's talk about the xbox 180
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:39.280]   lot of heat on micro i was surprised really there's a lot of heat on microsoft for their
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:47.920]   drm policies the new xbox one which will be out in the fall sometime uh in this earliest
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:53.520]   incarnation wouldn't allow uh people to share games you could give a game to somebody but only if
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:55:00.480]   you'd known them online in xbox live for more than 30 days uh there might not be a game resale market
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.720]   at all uh the xbox one always had to be on the internet at least 24 every 24 hours it would
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.440]   check to make sure that the games you were playing you owned all sorts of stuff and i think
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.840]   microsoft really fumbled this one because when uh for instance troops on the front line complained
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.480]   that well that's going to make it impossible for us to use you know in afghanistan and other places
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.920]   where us soldiers are fighting because we don't have guaranteed internet access
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:33.440]   microsoft's uh president don mattrick said well the only people i could see a problem with is if
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:44.160]   you're in a submarine and you guys should buy an xbox 360 um lovely yeah i think uh this is uh
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.600]   according to uh mary jane foley and um paul thurad on our windows weekly show
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:54.480]   mattrick was called into the carpet and said all right you got a choice it's the scott forestall
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.680]   situation remember scott was told you will have to you will apologize for maps he said no i will
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:06.880]   not they said goodbye at apple mattrick was supposedly told you will apologize for this or you will
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.760]   write a blog post retracting everything and mattrick chose the latter still working at microsoft
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.280]   they call it the xbox 180 i can't think of a single time a company like microsoft has made such a
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:24.240]   u-turn um this this thing's the windows eight of uh this this the windows eight of consul the second
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:31.520]   time in two months um i mean paul thurad wrote that um i thought he's dead on um you know the the
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.160]   thing is is i even people that i know that are hardcore gamers um not really excited about uh
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.360]   xbox one um i i think they went in the wrong direction with this they're they're trying to go more
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:51.680]   media player but media player is not a five hundred dollar box um and and uh yeah the the
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:59.280]   xbox 360 i think has gotten real popular but it got real popular once it was 199 right um i i just
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:06.160]   not sure that uh that they can do much with this completely um not backward compatible i mean a
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:09.680]   lot of times these councils aren't backward compatible or aren't backward compatible with
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:16.000]   everything but this one is completely unbackward compatible still at 500 bucks i the the target
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.960]   market for this was already narrow right for console it has gotten narrower and narrower and then
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.880]   they made it even more narrow by by keeping it at 500 dollars make it in a media box competing with
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:34.000]   what are now mostly hundred dollar media boxes see i go the other way i think microsoft was forward
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.640]   looking they knew that uh discs were dead and they said well look you know everybody's gonna be
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:45.280]   downloading games uh that's the future and uh we don't need to worry about a you use disc market
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.280]   that's a silly thing to worry about uh yeah no that part is right but they're but they're going in
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:57.360]   the wrong they're going too high with this uh without discs and without having to include sort of
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:04.240]   a disc player in there i mean there's still lots of xbox 360 games that that are not disc based that
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.560]   still could be backward compatible right i mean it could run into the end no it couldn't no it
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.320]   couldn't because it's a totally different architecture it's true it's a different architecture it's
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.840]   x86 yeah you can still model the architecture well yeah but if you are having to recreate a power
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.840]   pc thing even in an emulator to do the the xbox 360 graphics i mean i honestly the computing power
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.160]   in the ram that would take i mean sony's not doing it either i mean i genuinely think that it would be
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:34.400]   way more trouble than it's worth which is why you know the the understanding will be people will just
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.800]   buy a new one i mean it's been seven years if you want to continue to play your old games you buy
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:43.120]   them you know i mean i i i don't begrudge them that and i think pricing they're about even with
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:47.200]   sonyon i think what they did i think they lost a pr battle that's what i think i think they
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:51.040]   miscommunicated and they got smacked because there were some features that you know when you
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.960]   think about it we're actually quite attractive the idea that you could have a cloud collection of
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:00.320]   all your games for instance which is now no longer going to be the case so even if you bought a game
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:06.640]   on disc before you could then access that game from anyone else's system that's a really compelling
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:11.120]   offering and you could share games you know with up to ten members of your family or whatever or
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:15.600]   friends or whatever those four i think compelling ideas but they didn't they didn't sell it the
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:21.680]   right way and i think it was primarily a marketing and a pr failure and they've had a backtrack
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:26.960]   it's gonna be interesting battle this this fall between the years five hundred dollars though i
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.960]   mean i who's gonna buy it it five i already bought it you already bought it so leo the f
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:40.080]   and leo who's gonna buy it of course partly i have to right but uh and i'll probably buy a ps4 too but
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:45.520]   right right right i kind of i like it i like the idea of watching football and having stats come up and
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:49.040]   i don't know i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:54.400]   it seemed good to me i'm looking at the chat i think it's honestly why they had to do the the
[01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:00.000]   the PR turnaround though was because even though the idea of used games is going to be determined by
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.840]   the publishers now more so than by the console makers and and even though you know the idea that
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:09.840]   the disc based games are going to become less and less of a reality especially as as we all get
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:15.040]   google fiber and that sort of thing um the notion that the early market of people who are willing to
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:19.440]   pay five hundred dollars for a console or four hundred dollars plus sixty dollars for an i accessory for a
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:26.000]   playstation um are going to balk at any you know perceived slight of having you know less access to
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:33.040]   their stuff and um if you're going to potentially piss off that early base of the people who are
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.760]   willing to spend five hundred dollars on your product um you could potentially be you know dead
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.800]   before you hit the market do you think really do you think you think michael's i'm just gonna go into
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:46.400]   the marketplace in the christmas and nobody's gonna buy it no i think it'll be i think now they're
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:52.080]   fine i think it's okay yeah i think if they had and i think the by the time it launches um most
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.400]   people will have forgotten about the entire flop up because they they you know they backtrack fast
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:01.520]   enough and early enough that isn't it possible that console gaming in general is dead the games
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:07.200]   are 60 bucks um you know so many may say we're not gonna have any dr of course they're gonna have
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.240]   dr m do they like chronic archer's gonna let them do anything they want no they're not anything
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.800]   so many say that they won't have it on their own end but if the publisher wants to prevent
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.120]   if the publisher wants to prevent you know users from selling back a game or whatever they can and
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:25.440]   of course all the publishers will uh but i mean i i mean a lot of people have predicted that this
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:30.640]   is the last kind of generation of the traditional console and they might be right and i do think that
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:36.640]   they are all now moving into media devices but i also think that um the one potential area of interest
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.160]   for me with xbox would be if they could do to a large degree what they did with with um
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.080]   xfinity and and with fries and bios um to maybe make it act as a cable box because when you look
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.960]   at the internal guts and you look at what the you know different um high-end cable boxes are
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.480]   if you could basically make your xbox also act as that um and you didn't have to pay you know a
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.360]   monthly rental fee for your cable company or whatnot then it could kind of become a true you know
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.600]   home media device and it might offset the initial cost although of course they're going to bring it
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:15.600]   down lower before it gets a lot of mainstream adoption say they'll sales will disappoint on this
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:21.840]   um they'll sell way more xbox 360s than they'll sell xbox ones this year even if they stop selling
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.880]   xbox 360 yeah yeah they're not going to party market yeah right they're not going right they're
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.480]   very clearly they won't i mean i think that if they can actually lower the price of the 360 down to
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:35.360]   100 bucks then apple tv roku everybody should be really scared because at that point you're
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:40.480]   talking about a hundred dollar machine that that is a tremendous media player and also has a still
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.760]   a really great game library and a really loud fan actually it's not as loud as it used to be sorry
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.280]   but no more blue red rings of death they'll be blue now which is i think you could pick a good
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:57.440]   improvement uh what do you know alla mogordo new mexico for right white sand's laboratory right
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.440]   first test of the atomic bomb right it's also where et was buried the cartridge
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:11.760]   the canadian film crew is going to alla mogordo new mexico to a landfill site to dig up
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:18.560]   atari's et video game the urban legend was this game was so bad written in just a few weeks
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.400]   to capitalize on the success of the movie et it was so bad atari was so embarrassed and they were
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:31.600]   thinking that it was going to ruin the appeal of the 2600 they bulldozed millions of cartridges
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:37.360]   in alla mogordo new mexico no one knows the truth of it but this canadian company
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.040]   this film company is gonna is gonna try to dig it up
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.120]   got i have a million vanilla remember when they had all when everybody got rid of their
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:50.480]   milli vanilla albums and they started building those and they had the steam rollers yeah yes
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:56.000]   just because they lip sync come on that's what we mean yeah oh come on man i was i was like seven
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.400]   when that happened were you mad um i i don't i remember just being like wow they were faking
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.320]   i remember not being able to believe that they pulled it off you know so well but yeah i wasn't
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.080]   really mad i think this is another thing has changed i thought my mom getting bulldozed i
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:13.600]   thought man i'm gonna hold on to mine this is gonna be valuable because i'm at least getting
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:20.240]   right there so it's been 15 years how valuable is it and i do still have it it's in my parents
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.360]   you know my parents house somewhere it's so i have to eat the atari cartridge you do
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:31.920]   do i do so my sister is six years older than me and so um the the christmas of 82 which was
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:37.440]   right after i was born um she really wanted the iti game for the atari and my mom went all over
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.760]   atlanta to every toy store and and every like you know came out and went not trying to find the
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.760]   game because of the time you know right in time for christmas it was really hard to find my mom
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.600]   busted her butt to find this game which is the worst game ever is it really have you played it
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:57.280]   oh i have oh it's terrible but so bad oh you oh i want to play it i actually remember that game
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:01.600]   you know they're really i remember it too it's really hard to even get through one level i mean
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.160]   it's so poorly coded that if you don't do things just right i mean it's terrible i i remember playing
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:10.720]   it as a kid when i found the old atari and hooked it up and i didn't know the lore behind the game and
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:16.000]   i just remember thinking what is this like that the contrary game we're like the two like worst
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.880]   game the contrary any ask we're like the two worst games that i remember in my life and and the
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:28.320]   iti game is just oh wow i mean it's it's bad has anybody ever beat the iti game i don't even know if
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:32.560]   you can i think that that's part of the the lore is that because it's so poorly programmed it's hard
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:37.200]   to even get through all the way like you've you've almost got to like hack the wrong to a certain
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.000]   extent to fix it even get all the way through i mean it was it was i mean that was why the
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.560]   the video industry died and why no one had to go on a back because it's stuff like that is this
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.080]   is this gonna give you chills if i play this oh don't do it do it do it do it
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:06:02.480]   and get stranded in the woods the eyes are woods you didn't know is to get it home
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:08.880]   you must locate three pieces of his intergalactic telephone call his spaceship and get him to the
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:16.160]   landing site in time otherwise the spaceship leaves without him when you do you can be
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:20.640]   based on these points by picking up the candy piece the real soundtrack in musac
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:24.320]   learn to recognize the various symbols that appear really all the Atari could do is
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:33.280]   the greatest side effects a question mark is a fine phone zone that will show you which well
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:39.360]   in the scene if any contains a piece of the phone to retrieve it what is this video
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:45.920]   this is a walkthrough and the may ZT's neck and levitate him it's a walkthrough back into the
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:52.720]   same well how to be et there are only four scenes containing wells two of which you have to navigate
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:57.280]   fairly slow who put the effort into this and then post it on youtube that's what i want
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:04.720]   i think somebody who is going is going away i totally remember do you this all this all come
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:09.440]   back to you oh yeah should i skip ahead to the finale yes i had see if they have the the ship
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:14.400]   where the ship comes who's that that's what the government is oh yeah that's right he's wearing a
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:20.160]   bunny suit he can repel these two enemies and of course he can always run away from them
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.760]   so that's kids this is what video gaming was like when mommy and daddy were young
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.080]   unless it's the only way well i would argue that's not exactly what it was like
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:41.040]   the graphics were so bad in jail wow so let me i just didn't have the ship this is from uh t r
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:46.400]   zero d on youtube how to beat home video games part two
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:56.240]   i love it oh my goodness all right let's uh we'll we'll play a john i don't know if we can
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:59.680]   there you go are you playing the game now jad
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.960]   did you find this is a video this is this is just somebody else just playing it
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:14.640]   but yeah i'm wow you know no context you know from the apparently there's uh somebody who's gone
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:20.960]   through the ROM and tried to recode it neo computer dot org fixing
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:31.440]   i was just thinking that i i bet somebody went back and tried to fix that try to fix whatever
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:36.880]   problems or that's awesome so this is a whole website saying why et is so bad
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:45.680]   and how it can be fixed and so apparently if you can open your ntsc et rom and a hex editor
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:55.200]   you can make that's brilliant i love the internet man gosh that's and there's an easter egg a ninja

[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.640]   we should probably describe what happens for for the people who haven't i'll play it but don't play
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.840]   the audio chat because we we just we're not quick there's so much profanity in it that we cannot
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:35.280]   edit it entirely uh it's two and a half minutes and uh four and a half minutes it's a message from the
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.880]   fatter of mackephie software there he is john mackephie and apparently it's all about him
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:47.680]   being pissed off because he wrote he says this nice little software 15 years ago the mackephie
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:53.680]   antivirus he sold it it's on bay uh intel now long ago he gave he got the money and moved to
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:59.840]   belize and uh he says they screwed up my nice little program and he actually the whole thing is
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:08.320]   how do you uninstall mackephie because he gets emailed from tons of people asking him how you know
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:14.000]   because he's obviously he is john mackephie and uh people want to know how good he did he didn't he
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:22.720]   wasn't there no no no he came back and now he's apparently with his child brides
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:29.200]   cavorting all over the united states he's in the u.s he's not in belize no he's back he's back and
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:34.560]   and and apparently he's uh just they're living in up in portland because you know
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.760]   that's well you know what's where this whiskey can't make the story any weirder
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:45.680]   you know what i mean like this this is yeah um my favorite part is when he has a bath salt
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.880]   sorry because he's uh yeah he snorts bath salts in the video which was that's that's the thing
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:57.840]   the video becomes start out as him at his desk with his you know very fancy uh well there you go
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:04.560]   smoking jacket is very fancy smoke and then there's a fake nerd who's going to show you how to remove
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:10.240]   mackephie but he can't do it and then look at this and then okay so what's going on there's
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:18.240]   back backs is a bath salts here firearms of a variety of kinds how many child brides is that
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.880]   i'm counting six it's a it's a harem it's a harem you know and then they start getting naked
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:32.080]   charlie sheen crazy yes the fatal flaw in all this is that mackephie the assumption that mackephie
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:38.960]   software was ever good and that's right it actually went bad um is the problem just anyone else
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:44.640]   funny ironic that the the guy that the nerd they've got kind of looks like peter nordin he needs a
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.960]   wider tie he does but but it kind of looks like peter nordin a little oh you're right i wonder if
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:55.200]   that's intentional mmm this is the strangest thing i've ever seen some people i noticed a lot
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:59.200]   people thought it was funny i i didn't think it was funny i just thought it but this is bizarre creepy
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.560]   it's creepy it's a little creepy creepy i i don't know what he's trying to accomplish with this is
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:11.840]   just is he just trying to annoy uh yes his you know former company or i'm not sure what he wants
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:19.120]   he wants to show off his rock and bod i think he's just uh these are everything everyone's
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.120]   saying about me you all say i'm crazy let me show you how crazy i am i mean you know i think he's just
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.120]   it's a charlie sheen sort of like f u to the wind uh it's it's it's an entertaining spectacle but at
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:32.800]   the same time it's kind of sad you know you're kind of like this is the uh the deep we really
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:37.840]   be paying attention to this because this just big gets more crazy okay let's just pretend it didn't
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:45.840]   happen here here he does end up on installing the software using the 44 solution and very bad
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:57.600]   special effect this worst the worst green screening ever so weird just so weird all right i i guess i
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:02.160]   i mean we couldn't go through the show without mentioning that anyway all right here we'll
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:08.160]   clear cleanse our palate with a good story erin's law has finally been introduced zoloft green and
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:14.960]   jim scenson brener in the house ron wyden in the senate introduced a law to reform uh the cf aa
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:22.240]   uh so that it no longer uh uh can be used against people you know for ridiculous things like
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:29.200]   violation of a website's terms of service lying about your age on facebook checking personal email
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.840]   on a work computer all of these were deemed by the department of justice to be felonies
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:39.920]   uh and allowing the uh government to imprison americans for a violation of a
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:47.840]   non-negotiable private agreement dictated by a corporation yeah ridiculous so the proposal
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:54.560]   is designed to kind of focus the law back to its intentions so that it really is you know about
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:02.480]   computer fraud not not you know lying on facebook uh this is using the law
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:09.520]   right you know for using a a using a law to do something that it wasn't meant to do right because
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:14.000]   you it sort of persecute someone or or attack them well and this really and it's sad because
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:19.120]   erin's dead and uh nothing we can do can bring him back but this uh this really is
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:24.320]   circling around to our initial discussion about prison this is exactly prism this is exactly the
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:29.520]   problem which is uh these laws exist they're on the books and they can be used to persecute
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:37.520]   uh in a way that is you know appalling uh and if they've got the material you know they've got all
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:44.080]   the data on their servers they can find ways to you know send you to jail so these this law is
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:50.640]   going to pass right it's probably i don't know that's a good question i mean uh i don't know
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.800]   because the proposal is nice but if it doesn't actually get well they finally made it a bill so
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:04.480]   it's a step although i don't it doesn't look like it has a a number yet so they've introduced it but
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:12.080]   boy i just uh look again when you're writing your member of congress about prism you might want to
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:18.640]   just say hey by the way that erin's law let's pass that to yep can you support that too just as long
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:25.600]   as you're because it's just wide open to prosecutorial abuse as as we saw in the case of erin schwartz
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.920]   who really was hounded persec prosecuted and inappropriately uh and i don't know if it'll pass
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:38.240]   patrick something to keep track to track right right you're a member of congress
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:44.080]   patrick bejos great to have you and to get a uh international perspective on the craziness that is
