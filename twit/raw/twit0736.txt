[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020]   Dot-com hello Will Harris
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.700]   Hello Leo it's so good to be back. It feels like it's been a minute
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.540]   It has probably been a year or two will was one of the original
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.180]   Twit participants going way way back like 10 15 years
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.460]   Yeah, way back in time had a few few jobs since then last time you're here
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.340]   Conde Nast digital director working with Conde Nast Conde Europe and now you've got a new startup
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.840]   Yeah, working on a startup called called Intel Intel calm E N T A L E
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.780]   Dot-com, which is a visual interactive podcast app
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.420]   So as you're listening to your podcast you get the links that people are talking about and you get the profiles of the people that are on the show
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.220]   It lets you kind of deep dive into into the audio that you're listening to we need that
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.460]   According to Eric in the chatroom you haven't been on in four years since December 2015
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.460]   Oh, wow, that seems impossible
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.100]   That can't be right. Well, welcome back. I apologize. Well, thank you very much. Yeah
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.900]   So I guess Apple had some sort of shindig on Tuesday
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.740]   By innovation only there were a few people who said okay if you're gonna have an invitation that says by innovation
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.780]   You best innovate
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.620]   Devindra now first of all you probably already have an iPhone, but you can't say it because it's in barcode
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.420]   I don't have it, but I have touched them and they're very nice. Oh
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.660]   You could say that about a old phone
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.380]   Yes
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.260]   The iPhone 11 it was a weird it was kind of a weird event for Apple first
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.900]   Well, they had so much to talk about that they had to jam it in they didn't start with their traditional
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.740]   Ode to money making and the stores they kicked they kicked right into Apple
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.420]   Arcade plus and then TV plus and then they went to the watch by the time they got to the iPhone which I thought was gonna be this story of the
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.860]   The hour they only announced one the iPhone 11. I said the most successful iPhone this year was the iPhone 10R
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.700]   here's its successor the iPhone 11 now with two lenses and
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.340]   I thought well, this is interesting the big I think the big story there was the price
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.860]   Which is 50 bucks less than the iPhone 10 are at its launch 699
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.060]   And then they said oh oh and by the way, there are some other iPhones the iPhone
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.660]   Pro iPhone 11 pro and the iPhone 11
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.940]   Flowmax
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.620]   I mean sorry pro max. I say flow max because I can't remember the all the all have slow fees
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.620]   There's a lot they all have slow fees slow mo
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.340]   selfies
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.780]   So these this is Apple is now in a tick-tock talk situation aren't they since the iPhone 6?
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.140]   They don't used to be every other year would be an S and kind of the same form factor
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.260]   But a little bit improved and then a big improvement the next year like the 10 was a big improvement
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.380]   But the 10s was a talk
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.260]   And this is really a talk to the talk isn't it? I think it kind of that speaks to like how
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.100]   Smart phone upgrade cycles are working now too like most people keep their phones two or three years
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.740]   It kind of makes sense. There's no point like killing yourself to
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.180]   Bring something new and groundbreaking out every two years when you can kind of
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.980]   Coast on how people actually buy these phones and take some more time with that hardware
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.060]   So yeah, I'm not surprised that the series phones aren't too revolutionary
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.740]   It is nice having an extra lens across the line the three lenses on the pros
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.660]   That's gonna be really interesting. They really cleaned up the phone names to
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.200]   Cuz the ten R and the ten S those were all really dumb and confusing because it was a Roman numeral so it looked like
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.580]   Yes, it's just it was a mess
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.620]   So I've eleven nice and clean I've eleven pro just like Macbook and Macbook Pro
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.700]   It's all good
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.980]   And I think we're all expecting the big big upgrade to be next years when we're gonna see 5g most likely the 2020 iPhones
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.860]   Yeah, but is there such a thing Georgia as a professional phone?
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.460]   You know professional for the phone that you have in your pocket better than but you know no
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.980]   I understand a Mac and a Mac Pro
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.140]   I just in a Mac book and a Mac book pro even an iPad and iPad Pro, right?
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.140]   Yeah, that's now you're starting to stretch it. Yeah
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:45.460]   More pro is just easy and quick and it makes you feel a little bit more elite. Yeah, so you know
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.620]   But they need something short and snappy and easy and people understand that you're getting a little bit more for it
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.060]   And I think the thing for me that makes it pro is like as someone who spends like
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.660]   Literally all day on your phone because I mean the light listening to podcasts or making software that's making podcasts
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.500]   It's like I just need more battery life
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.420]   And I think the fact that this year Apple finally put more more battery in the back of these things
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.100]   You know for me like having that extra battery life is what makes it pro
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.940]   Actually, it's more battery
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.260]   You you make a huge case so it now let me ask because I wasn't clear is this five
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.380]   So the iPhone Pro Max are saying has five hours more battery life than what?
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.860]   The 10s Max like they're equivalent so it is it is head-to-head it is more but we don't
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.900]   Yeah, we do know that the new display they're saying I think the new OLED is like 15% more efficient
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.860]   Okay, and the the new processor is likely more efficient too
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.400]   So these this is where the battery life is coming from probably I've also been hearing from a lot
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.720]   Of people have installed iOS 13 the public beta and 13 one that that's much more efficient. They're getting much better battery life
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   So it's great. It's on all three fronts
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.680]   Apple the new processor is the A13 bionic
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.560]   Is that right?
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.820]   Believe so. Yeah, sorry. So I think I think that's the that's the other annoying thing by the way with the pro designation
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:17.120]   Last year the 10r and the 10s phones had the exact same processor. Yes, and that was a big price difference now
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   It's like an iPhone 11 basic and iPhone Pro still with the same processor
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.200]   Yeah, and that's I I don't know I kind of wish there was a little more of a bump there
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   Just to really earn that pro title because right now what you have the extra camera
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.880]   You have the OLED really nice refresh OLED screens and the kind of slick not slick
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:42.800]   But like the matte glass back and the stainless steel construction. That's kind of all you're getting that's surgical stainless surgically
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.680]   Yeah, so you're just great. I thought was really weird because like I'm not going to perform an open heart surgery with my phone
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.200]   I could see that in a scalpel, but a phone. I don't know
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.840]   Yeah, I think for me the most frustrating thing about the whole
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.480]   Um, you know 11 11 pro 11 pero max is that as you can see here they ship the case
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.600]   For your new phone. Oh, you're getting ahead of the actual new I hate that you get a box from
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.040]   And you go. Oh boy. It's here. It's here. Oh my word is here
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.000]   I open the box and it's just the flipping case
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   You really you really all in an apple because you bought the apple clear case, which is $40
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.120]   And as far as I could tell functionally identical to the 799 one I bought surgical brake clear plastic
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.000]   That's what you're paying for
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.240]   But you know it'll fit just right so that's probably important
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.280]   Um, okay, so the so the this is a 7 nanometer processor
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.160]   This is actually I think apple deserves more credit for its custom processors than they're getting
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.720]   Uh, this looked like and it was interesting because they brought somebody for the first time
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   I can ever remember from the processor group up on stage. Oh, yeah, it was like an intel keyed out for for a second there
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.400]   Yeah, it was like what we're not half billion transistors or something. It was just it's mind boggling what they're doing
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.680]   I think they're my guess is they're highlighting these guys because they're eventually going to be making processors for the entire kit
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.080]   Right all the way up all the way up to the computers
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   Yeah, I think if we're we're seeing snapdragon laptops already and you know windows machine is running on snapdragon
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.240]   So they they are kind of setting the stage. It just kind of makes sense like oh by next year
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.600]   If we see a macbook powered by the a14 or whatever
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.920]   Uh, we wouldn't be too surprised. I guess
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.920]   I do have to say that increased battery life and it's across the line all the five hours is the longest on the pro max
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.000]   If that's accurate and we won't know until I guess i'm going to guess that
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.160]   Places like engadget and i'm more have embargoed
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:51.920]   Units that they'll report on and i'm going to guess wednesday usually a few days before they ship they get the the reviews start coming out and all the main
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.720]   stream publications
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.200]   So we won't really note and then friday. I fix it will won't be in australia
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   And they will get at midnight. They will get their iphone and take it apart immediately
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.360]   So we'll then know how much battery will know a little bit more about the processor
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:15.440]   Uh the cameras and all that stuff, but uh, you know, I think that's if they really get literally get five hours more that's
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.600]   Huge
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.160]   That's 30 40 percent. That's a big difference
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:27.040]   It's a big deal like I don't know if it's enough to upgrade from like the ten s models if you have one of those
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.120]   You're getting all the battery life on an iphone
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   It depends what you do with your phone
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.040]   Right, it's nice not to have to find a place to charge your phone. So if you're using it
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.400]   All the time this may be worth it. I think it's exactly. Yeah, don't have to carry one of those not that
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.680]   Lovely, you know, hunchback kind of battery cases on the back. Yeah, so that's pretty pretty
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.040]   So ugly. I carried I currently have the the ten s max with the battery case
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.320]   Oh, wow, and it is like carrying a brick in your like a python. It's a battery
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.280]   Yeah, so one of the um, so these all come out on friday friday
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.720]   Coincidentally happens to be my birthdays. This could be like the best birthday
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.280]   On on the planet because uh going and picking those guys up and then getting the pipe
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.120]   Wow, I can say getting the python out of the pocket the python is full of the back
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.360]   It would be um, it would be very excited. That's a brat kavanaugh story from college. You don't
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.560]   Don't want to share that one
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.880]   Too soon too soon way too soon. Um, um
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.480]   So that's an example of
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.280]   I know it's not because johnny. I have left
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:43.520]   But the johnny. I've era it's always been thinner. Center. Center. Center. Center apple didn't say thinner once
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.080]   They said better battery life. How will you yeah? They're fun?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   They are
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.240]   Have you you know after the ben gate? I think they went you know what thinner is probably not better. I think that people in the nuff
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.760]   Canick's chicken. Let's make sure it's actually better. Yeah, thin enough battery life is better
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.240]   They are getting added weight because of this
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.000]   Uh, the surgical grade steel and maybe the new display like I
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   So from just suspects along the te the 10 pro max or the 11 pro max
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.480]   Ways half a pound. This is the heaviest iPhone we've ever made
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   Yeah, I feel I feel like they were waiting between that and the
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.640]   Um the new keyboards on the new macbook pros. I feel like they were just literally like waiting for
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.080]   The dude
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   Thank god. Take the butterfly keyboard with your johnny
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.440]   Put the keyboard back on and an extra little bit of weight on it. Like thank god johnny is not here to
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.280]   To say I know it's not about that. I know that can't be the case
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.960]   But still it does feel like that doesn't it? I can't I mean he just left
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.640]   Yes probably in the
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   Before he left has to been in the works
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.280]   Already. Yeah, this wasn't a quick fix unless there was a skunk works, you know in the back of the campus
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.320]   When johnny leaves were going to show this new keyboard
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.440]   Just talking to tell him
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   Yeah, the reports were that he basically checked out for the past couple years. Yeah, so who knows who knows like how
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.280]   There's a little kind of blind up. Yeah. Yeah. I hope you're right. Well, haryss
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.560]   I do hope there is a new and and by the way, I think it's pretty clear because apple only announced the low end
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.760]   I pad the 3 29 version and with the giant vessels where they look big now, don't they
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.440]   Giant bezels the home button a fingerprint reader
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.240]   They only announced that's which means and we know thanks to the the european
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.640]   database
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.240]   That there are at least two more models coming. I think that I saw that
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.480]   So there's got to be and they're gonna we know there's a Mac pro coming this year
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.120]   If you can afford it and we need to know that
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.040]   So we says I think there's going to be an october event with all these things, right
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.160]   Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.480]   So yeah, I would have to say I was disappointed like on the you know back to the sort of entry level
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.040]   iPad things like it was great that they added pencil support. I really thought a good feature for the
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.000]   for the
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.320]   11 the 11 pro models would have been pencil support
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.640]   Tyler's or needs support we didn't get that. Oh wow
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   With those giant pencils shorter pencils
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.640]   No, just like the notes just a little bitty you know stylist there
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:27.040]   I would have wanted it just magnetically stuck to the end and like it charged just like it does in the eyes
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   You would lose it so fast
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.280]   Anyways, right I would lose it anyways
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   Although it would be it would be the full circle right which is Steve jobs announcing the iPhone in 2007 and saying like who wants these like really awful
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   styluses, yes, I
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.280]   Fingers
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.660]   Yeah, that would be a sort of heretical
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.640]   Money
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.160]   Oh, that's okay
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   My worry would be how the stylist is charged
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.840]   You know like if you were plugging them into the end that always makes you want to go up to like you know
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.720]   When the old iPad had the pencil sticking out of the end when I charged
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.000]   You want to go up and just grab and break it off. I had this
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   Very strong a natural urge Samsung is same as completely nailed this. This is the note 10 plus
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.080]   They've got the stylus. It's in the body. It pops out. It's charging while it's in the body. I mean this
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.880]   Maybe apple didn't do it because they would have to copy this. I mean this is the only sensible thing
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.280]   And other phones did that beforehand. It's not yeah. Yeah, no, it's not Samsung didn't invent it
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.360]   I'm not saying but it would look it off a lot like a note if if apple released
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.280]   A stylus has have a history of like terrible like charging things like the fact that you still have to
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.320]   That you can't use your wireless mouse while it's charging
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   Like
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.080]   Like that was a johnny eye you put a thing on the planet. I blame sir johnny for that
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.720]   Oh boy
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.120]   I want to say the one thing i'm disappointed to get didn't get on the pro phones is a fast refresh rate
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.840]   And i was gonna ask you i was gonna ask you because because pixel rumors are 90 hertz
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.680]   The uh, which one was it was a wahweh? No, no, it was the one plus seven pro has a 90 hertz refresh rate
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.480]   Yeah, and we've seen i think the razor gaming phone
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.840]   That new razor. Yeah, yeah, like we're seeing more and more of that
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.200]   On smaller screens like just having that that movement when you're scrolling is just so much smoother
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.560]   It's like butter like once you see that on a phone you kind of want that everywhere and a pro phone
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.440]   That that's your time to put it in there are high refresh rate oleid panels out there. They could have done this
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.520]   Are the other high refresh rate panels lcd's or
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.160]   They are all it's i wonder i can i have to look that up. Yeah, remember refresh rates also tied to battery life
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.800]   In fact that was so the other thing they announced is a new apple watch a series five
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.400]   Um, can we before we go to the apple watch video? Can i just mention the colors of the phone
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   These i was so excited to get the colors of the phone and they are the most
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.960]   Unappeal i might be the only one so just no you're right
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   You're angry hate leo not no
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.880]   I agree with you
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.160]   Sadist
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.760]   Colors and i was all in for purple i was very excited and it ends up being like corpse purple
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.280]   That is the color of someone that has died purple on my phone
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.920]   Meant green
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.520]   Corpse purple
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.280]   That's a color like come on it is a hundred percent true
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.040]   So you're talking you know, it's not you're talking about the colors of the 11 right the 11
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.120]   Bile yellow mint green
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   And then corpse purple they're absolutely it is it is it is a little bit like a bruise
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.800]   uh the purple the yellow is
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.320]   Yes
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.720]   They've really gone for this kind of like um
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.240]   sees
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   They've already gone in on this like seasonal color thing
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.640]   And you know the all the straps that come in seasons, but it feels like they just picked
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.240]   Um, you know your your phone is something that you're going to change less often than your watch strap
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.320]   And I feel like the color should be maybe like more for experimentation, but should maybe be a little bit more like
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.720]   uh
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.440]   Universal yeah, it's something you could say less red blue
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.920]   Something that's appealing more appealing. I'm sorry. I'm what the hell it colors
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.800]   So
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.880]   That's the iPhone 11, which is like the 10r and those half dozen colors
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.800]   The iPhone 11 pro has black white and this weird
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:33.040]   Green green. It's tactical. Yeah, no, but they don't call it that they call it uh corpse green
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:40.400]   No, they don't call it a forest green. I think is no no no no no dark dark green or some black green black or something
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   Some weird name for it
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.160]   Uh, yeah, mid mid night green something like that. But why what's it's what is that color?
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.800]   Are they do they have their fingers on the pulse of the fashion world?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.640]   And they just know that you know like calvin cline like this is going to be the color for the fall
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.440]   It's a weird color. I saw it in person too. And it kind of changes depending on the lighting
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   It's really weird. So i'm like low lighting. It just looks like silver. You can't even see the green on it
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:15.120]   Uh, maybe it was like the production process for making these weird cases like maybe they saw like oh, this is kind of maybe a default color
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.560]   It's kind of nice. I don't know baby poop green. I can yeah, I can tell you as somebody who used to work in fact
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   What goes to soil green green
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.360]   Let's go ahead
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.440]   Now the thing about these these colors is that like you never see them anyway
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.600]   Because the first thing you do is put it in a case right?
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.280]   I'm sorry
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.120]   It doesn't even matter
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.240]   Well, i'm definitely going to be getting a cake like you have to get a kick
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.200]   I'm sorry. These are not colors that you're going to want to they're not going to match anything. They're
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   I'm glad you're saying that
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.360]   You bought the new phone. That's about it because if I said that they said oh, yeah, you wear cargo pants too leo
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.640]   You don't know you don't know what the kids are doing
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.000]   I do wonder if these are the phones that we can have without cases because they are making a big deal about tough
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.880]   These are tougher. Yeah, and yeah, I've heard I've heard there are some crazy stress tests
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:11.120]   People basically like almost hammering these screens and just like wiping off the remnants like not leaving much of his crats
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.840]   So I really want to see how tough they are because I don't like cases
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.320]   I just want to feel the phone and I've had to have cases for so long because these things have
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.000]   I don't think they'll be tough enough is my my thought
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.160]   I've broken a lot of phones in my days and I now you know, I luckily i'll just like, you know
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.520]   You put a it's not a pretty case, but it's protective. I will probably be so they put the phone in a wage tunnel
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.560]   And then they throw fruit at it
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.640]   Who's ever damaged a phone with fruit or a plastic toy?
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.120]   It might be wrong
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.960]   Give me a sidewalk like throw it to a sidewalk. I want to see how chatter is there. Yeah, it's the weirdest thing from
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.400]   the give it get a protra beja the
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.480]   It's the first year that the apple care plan right is payable monthly
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.360]   Yeah, maybe the whole idea is the propaganda that you don't need a case for it, but also pay for the apple care mom
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   Yeah
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.320]   And by the way is a pretty big deductible and you only get two tenses to break it a year and etc etc
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:25.600]   I can do two two times is good enough for me a year. I don't know if anyone's more clumsy. You're pretty sure
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.720]   I I've only broken I've broken my phone twice one year, but that was I was testing cases once which was
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.800]   Ridiculous in my own fault and the other time I was bringing donuts home and the donuts started to slide and I saved the donuts instead of the phone
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   Oh man miss everyone has priorities mistaken priorities. That's terrible. I would say that's the exact right priorities
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.880]   Save the donuts leave the phone
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   Yeah
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:02.880]   Camera it's got low light. It's got night mode somewhat like night site, which is of course from google
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.800]   Uh, if fact it's doing ironically, I think exactly the same thing google does on their pixel three
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.920]   With the stacking of nine photos
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.960]   Um, it does look good
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.400]   Apple's somewhat playing catch up on this phone you think
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:26.080]   Three lenses. I mean it's a different process right because the pixel three what it's still just one lens and they're kind of doing that all on software
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.120]   So this is kind of apple approaching it through their hardware
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:36.240]   Thing like their hardware expertise and personally I like having that hardware more but I bought my wife pixel three
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.320]   I'm still so jealous of the photo. She gets out of that phone. It's an amazing thing. It'll be interesting to see single lens and it's amazing
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.960]   But apple so apple. I'm really hoping I'm really hoping that having the
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.680]   The sort of three cameras on the back is going to mean less of a need for like I really enjoy taking
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.880]   Um like like photography as a hobby
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.760]   I never want to have like a real camera. So I have those little like the lenses from moment
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:08.320]   Which are really good like high quality glass that will do you you know animal or fake or telephoto or those kind of things
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   Um the ability to to maybe not have to have those would be amazing
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.560]   I have already three lenses on my samsung phones and I have to say I fell in love with them immediately
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.440]   Especially the ultra wide. It's really nice to be able to be in a
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.800]   So I like wide angle photography in general and to be in a situation where you can get everything is fantastic
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.240]   So we're gonna see better photos. I love this high key thing. They're doing this is a new portrait mode
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.720]   uh where the
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:41.040]   Background falls off to bright white and the picture the portrait is is high contrast. I think that's a make your own apple ad portrait
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   Basically. Yeah, what they used to look like. Yeah
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Yeah, I think that's gonna be nice
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.760]   You just need to caption it think different and then you're fine
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.840]   Yeah, there you go
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.640]   I guess a lot is still up in the air until we get review units, but i'm very curious about how they're going to use those three lenses
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.880]   Are they are they all live at once and then the image is somehow?
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   Chosen
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.680]   Well, they have that that is it the fusion feature or something that takes I basically takes
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.200]   A picture with all three cameras and then uses ai fusion to kind of figure out the best shot
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.600]   Based on all the different shots it has so I think for those kinds of things it kind of does that but we also saw the preview of this
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.440]   I forget the name is a video recording app and it can film it shoot video. Yeah, holy
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:35.040]   Video across multiple cameras at once that's pretty insane front and back that's a testament to the speed of the a13 bionic and
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   One other thing which they didn't talk about but it's going to make a big difference which is high speed storage as well, right?
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.000]   They're using much faster class as as our many new phones much faster class storage
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.080]   Um, and so the ability to save two or three high resolution streams simultaneously
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.320]   They're also the selfie cam the front cam is now 12 megapixels
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.640]   So you're I can't wait i'm gonna take it to ces and interview people because i'll have the reverse shot in the
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.080]   I mean this is going to be amazing and also portrait mode from the standard wide angle now
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.120]   You don't have to like move back just to do portraits. So right it's all it's all more functional nice upgrades
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.800]   I feel like storage is going to continue to be a problem, right? Everything is 64 gigabytes by default
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.880]   Uh all these photos all the stuff like those fusion photos are going to be huge
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.280]   uh recording 4k video decently on these machines like that's going to eat up storage
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.920]   I would like to see a nice solution for that problem
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.880]   Maybe making 120 gigabytes the standard
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.480]   Uh, maybe making iCloud a little more modern because it's still kind of a clunky thing to use
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   The fact that the pro the fact that the pro max
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.960]   Comes with 64 gigabytes as default. It's like criminal like it's criminal the amount of money you're paying
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:55.120]   As next you're I don't know what it is uh with you guys, but it's like an extra 150 quid over here
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.760]   Um to get 256 you're like this is just absolutely insane
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.160]   Yeah, I paid 1449 for the 256
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.880]   Flowmax
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.800]   Yeah, so that's why I got it in gold. So at least I get something of value
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:19.200]   You know, you can look rich good while you're cutting people open with the surgical steel
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.600]   Right, man. I caught you with my phone my gold phone
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.200]   Uh, I I did at least I wanted me to get uh
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.560]   Apple care for her, but I don't I'm not gonna buy apple care because I just I feel like it's always a rip off
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.520]   But you're gonna then get her a nice case
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.440]   And I got her yeah, I want to get an otterbox
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.520]   They're not available to next month. So I got her a knockoff otterbox to use until she gets the otterbox
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.080]   For the first time that I can remember uh apple is offering an unlocked and sim free on day of
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.720]   Usually there's a delay before you get the unlocked version
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.600]   I don't know why anybody would buy anything but the unlocked yeah sim free version. Yeah, is that is that um
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.520]   That's never been the case over here. They've always had day one unlocked sim free had to
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.320]   I think yeah, you guys have laws. Yeah, you got laws. We don't have law over here. Yeah
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.200]   Great great. Have those
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.040]   Yeah, so uh much longer
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.280]   Well, it's because the carriers I think the carriers really didn't want apple to do this so apple
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.120]   On a day of sale wouldn't do it, but then they'd sneak it in a few months later
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.280]   Um, but uh, yeah, of course unlocked. Why would you you know, why wouldn't you?
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.040]   Uh, all right. I don't I don't think anything more to say about the phones. I just I mean you have to spend some time on it
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.280]   I think this is a nice upgrade, right?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.640]   Yeah, apple
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:42.160]   I think apple's getting a little sensitive to the price issue which is why they cut 50 bucks off of the 10r to offer the iphone 11
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.960]   50 bucks 699 starting point. That's a good that's a good place to put it
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.560]   Obviously, uh as I just said you can you can and end up spending almost 1500 bucks if you want
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   On the phone and I think what's interesting is that on the price sensitivity side
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.600]   It's the first time that I've seen when when you go to buy the phone
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.320]   as part of the
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.480]   Like the choosing your options process it asks you do you want to trade in your old phone?
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.680]   Yeah, so suddenly or you know your thousand dollar phone becomes that's a hundred dollar fair. That's a bit
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.240]   Um, although I will say that the the apple traded program like
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.560]   I ran my last year's gear through it and the
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   You know the answer was like quite jokes
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:32.400]   It was there's no price difference. There's no price difference for trading in a 64 versus a 256
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   They offered me
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   Um, I have a series for
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.480]   Uh gold stainless steel watch with the millenase loop last year I paid
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.200]   804 and the trade in value was 80 pounds
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.040]   what
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   90 off
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.800]   And I was like wow, you know what I think I'll keep it
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.960]   My dad
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.880]   Like it's a
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.440]   Series for was saying the steel was was was mad
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.720]   But they're not even selling it might be because they're not even selling the series for anymore
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.960]   They they just could be eliminated that from the lineup. That's why it is funny. How money for it now. It's exclusive. Oh
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.000]   Sell it on your own
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.400]   Oh, it's kind of hilarious though apples like turning that around on us. It's like oh well 64 gigabytes and 256 gigabytes of memory
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   It's not causing us. It's not costing us that much more, you know, so we're we're valuing it the same for you
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.200]   Like things like that. It is funny to see their value
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.960]   Considerations when they're not actually selling it region seven c'sman in our chat room says something that worries me
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.680]   He says if you get the unlocked phone then
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.960]   The carriers that offer Wi-Fi calling will not support it on that phone
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.320]   You have to get their phone is that do you know if that's the case?
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.200]   I've not heard that before
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.800]   It is it is kind of a feature. They kind of have to begin sometimes so
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.520]   I wouldn't be surprised that if that's true
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.360]   I will say I hate Wi-Fi calling like it was a feature that was supposed to work really great to help you with low coverage areas
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.440]   On T-Mobile. It's always been kind of terrible and it's one of those things
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.160]   You can't really rely on it unless you know you have rock solid internet
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.120]   And I don't know tell you what coverage in most places I think is good enough like that's the thing
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.320]   I had a big issue with Verizon
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.280]   Buying an unlocked phone and bringing it to them
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   um
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.720]   My grandparents took my kids to Canada this year
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.880]   and um
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.280]   I checked all of our plans and it said like you free roaming in camp free roaming data in Canada and everything's fine
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.880]   um
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.480]   and I
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.000]   As soon as they crossed the the border I got this alert
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.800]   you've you've
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.640]   Currently spent $250 on on on Wi-Fi
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   What?
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   I blame Canada at $500. We're going to turn it off
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:00.080]   You've currently spent $500 like 10 minutes later. You've currently spent $500 on on roaming data
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.840]   Um, we're turning it off. Um and it it was because
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.200]   My younger son's phone I had brought in I had bought it best buy
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.600]   And and brought in and so they said they said we don't offer
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.360]   uh
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.680]   International roaming on phones you bring in
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.000]   So
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.720]   That's terrible. I'll be where wow always turn off international data. Yeah, always. Yeah, so here's the on the apple site
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.160]   This is the explanation, which is clear as mud. Will my new iphone be unlocked?
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.040]   And it says nearly all iphone model models sold on apple.com at the apple store are unlocked nearly all
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.200]   Uh, the exception is when you buy a phone with 18 t next
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.880]   Then it's locked 18 t which makes sense. That's a pay as you go
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:52.960]   Uh phone, but but any carrier if you pay for it outright or use iphone payments will be unlocked
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.360]   So I don't know the sim free model just doesn't come with a sim
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.800]   So it says purchase a sim free model. This is just like any other iphone
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.760]   But doesn't have a carriers nano sim since you have to have a carrier sim to use it
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.320]   I can't imagine that it's limited in any other way
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.400]   So this is a good time to to remind people about e sim by the way if you're getting a new phone
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.360]   Do the e sim if you're not planning to like
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:23.600]   Swap your cards a lot across different phones because then if you go international then you can plug in a physical sim
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.320]   It wouldn't be then a dual sim. It'll be a dual sim phone
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.000]   It is dual sim like they were dual sims since last year, but one has to be e sim
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.600]   And the only way it really works is if your local one is e sim
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.320]   Very interesting
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   um
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.840]   And and and do all carriers support e sim
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   That's a good question. I know two mobile does I believe right? Yeah, do they?
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.040]   Not all of them. It's it's kind of weird. I know two mobile does try sure because I've seen that try it
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.720]   um
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.080]   All right
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.440]   The new iphones are here and we'll have i'll get mine on friday
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.400]   We'll have I think so this mica will have reviews and so forth
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.120]   And as I said, I expect that gajet and other places will have reviews i'm more
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.800]   Uh probably around wednesday. That's usually when the embargo goes off
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.760]   Does rene have one georgia?
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.400]   I don't know. Yeah, you do
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.960]   No
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.520]   He doesn't he doesn't sound anything
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.920]   He's that good? He's gonna stop. He just goes dark. I can't tell you what i'm doing right now
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.480]   No, you know, it's not too
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Dark he's too busy doing videos constantly. I know the poor guy works
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.640]   I have no making appointment to tail off
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.720]   So he was at the event we'll have him on tuesday on mac break weekly. We'll talk
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   Uh about the event when he saw how's the camera bunk divindra you saw it right is the camera bump. I've seen it terrible
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:51.120]   It's weird. I think it's a little more. I gotta look at the like tennis max. I have I think it sticks out a little more
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.400]   Yeah, um, it's a little yeah, it's like a double bump
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.520]   Yeah, yeah, it's it's really it's funky looking. I don't mind it too much
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.400]   Um, but you know people who complain about those things. It's gonna be there
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.400]   The new pixel four leaks we've been seeing looks like that same thing camera square. Yep looks less
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.840]   Protrusion like it sticks out a lot less so okay
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:19.760]   One thing if the phone was thicker so that there was not a camera bump or do you think the camera bump is the best way to go about it?
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.360]   I don't mind thicker phones thicker phones mean more battery life. So yeah, and then it was just make it a little thicker
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.800]   Yeah, that's the real issues lying flat on the table
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.440]   Yeah, it bothers me a little bit
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.280]   And I've seen a lot of people scratch up their lenses and if you scratch that lens you're screwed
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.760]   Like that's that's a big repair
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.240]   So you know how you avoid um
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.840]   Any issue with the camera bump tool is by just getting
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.920]   Oh
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.240]   You know when they publish that book of johnny eyes designs that is not in it
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.880]   No, that's not
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.960]   You can a regular case that sticks and makes it flat then it's yeah
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.000]   You're gonna have a case. It's gonna have a recess easier than the hunchback
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.120]   Right
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.760]   But if you're gonna make it that thick anyway, why not put make a thicker phone so you get more battery
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.120]   Anyway, they've solved the battery issue. It sounds like we'll find out
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.240]   We'll see we'll see I want to I do want to talk about the watch because there's some clever technology in the watch and yes
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.040]   There's another thing apple did that everybody's been asking for but first a word from our sponsor
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.480]   We've got divindra hardwar from engadget here. It's always great to have you divindra
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:38.240]   Uh, actually I love this panel. Georgia dao from i'm war.com senior editor over there
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.840]   Adding some class to the panel and will harris
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.280]   Taking it all away again. CEO of entailed i'm just kidding
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.600]   It's so nice to see you

[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.800]   I have been known. I'm actually um
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.640]   Currently just discovered that in the uk now you can buy lachroy
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.400]   You're kidding. I am now completely addicted to lachroy and every player
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's just fizzy water. Why are people so excited about lachroy?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.120]   Is it lachroy or lachua?
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.560]   Look, so the the fashion label is lachua because the drink is
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:29.040]   lachua lachroy and the best thing is to be drinking lachroy whilst wearing lachua
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.200]   So i've not yet done, but i'm not ruling out
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.880]   I wear lachost while I drink lachroy. Is that okay?
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   Our show today brought to you by something very easy to pronounce

[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.720]   which
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   Really confuses people I try to wear a white periwig and ruffled shirt

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.880]   Dot com we're big fans
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.600]   so
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.920]   The series
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.600]   They killed the series four watch
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.120]   They dropped the price in the series three to 199
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.440]   I think my theory is that the series five isn't that different from the series four
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.360]   So they they wanted to kind of you know have a bigger jump from the base model to the higher end model
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.200]   They did do something though. Everybody wants. It's actually a watch now
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.000]   I'm so excited. It stays on
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.880]   What?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.800]   I'm overly excited. It was the only thing i've always been asking for every single year
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.480]   Uh, I was sure I wasn't going to get it and when it came out. I was like dancing
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.800]   I was shaking it up. I was
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.160]   Excited. Android. Where does it everything does it?
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:07.760]   Yeah, I've been dying for it. I want I want the watch. I love my apple watch
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.280]   I hate having to do this stupid flick thing and oh, I know i'm getting angry
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.320]   No, I am so done with that. I'm the most excited not the phone
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.000]   It's all watch all the time for me. Also, you're a therapist. It's changed everything
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.160]   The last thing you want to do in a session
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.800]   Is this is go like
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.360]   Oh times
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.160]   There's no way there is no way i have two clocks in my room, right?
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.280]   But I always I've noticed this by the way therapists
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   At least my therapist cleverly stationed a walk a clock behind your head
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.640]   So that looks like they're looking at you
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.600]   Well, there meanwhile they're watching the clock
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:56.400]   Well, we have one for us to make sure we times that it's to make sure we time the pace of the session properly
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.960]   It's not just a throw and I've won for my my people so they can also time what they say and it's not like
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.120]   35 minutes has gone by and we haven't said anything, but you know what sometimes it's just nice to have it
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.320]   There it's always on and I don't have to flick tick do anything
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.560]   It's a watch finally apple watch is a watch. How will you?
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.640]   I'm just really really excited. That's it. Nothing else mattered. Please
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:32.320]   I'm glad I brought this up. I have to say that over a over the course of a few years of wearing the apple watch like every day
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:38.480]   To work to meetings many of which can be very boring. You do get very good at the kind of
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.800]   Nonch-lunk kind of stretch where you're sort of twisting your hand
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:49.840]   Since like yeah, i'm totally listening to what you're saying. I'm just doing a little kind of a real wriggle
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.600]   Just to find out what's going on. It's really nice not to have to do that anymore
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.160]   It's I like that move though the way that you did that will was pretty
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.560]   Inventive that he learned that from his youth when he had to put his arm around a girl in the theater
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.120]   I'm gonna just
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:14.720]   Our sound girl and looking at the time. It's probably not a great sign for the date
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.440]   No, that's true. You put your arm around and then look at your watch. She can't tell what you're doing
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.560]   Hopefully you don't care what the time is. No, it's so fabulous. Yes, that's when you want to
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.440]   Let's get off my dating
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:36.400]   It's all you know we owe it all to the lower tier project office. No, no ltpo stands for
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.600]   Actually when I go to this army site
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.400]   For ltpo warning potential security risk ahead. This is army dot mill
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.360]   And google's saying don't go there whatever you do. Okay, that's about right. Yeah
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.720]   It's low temperature polycrystalline oxide
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.640]   That's what makes it possible and the reason it works is because
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.320]   I'm sorry. I wasn't talking to you google. It's because
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:07.120]   It's uh, it's it's a variable refresh rate OLED screen, which means it can go from the full refresh rate of
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.600]   60 hertz down all the way to one
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.160]   One refresh per second
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   What a great idea right?
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.360]   That's you don't need to refresh more often that with a watch face right every second
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:24.160]   Yeah, you won't get that smooth sweep second hand, but if that's fine, who cares who's looking at the second
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:31.200]   I want cares about the second. Are you okay? Well, every second. I'm more no there's something aesthetic about a sweep second hand
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.280]   I just kind of like it
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.320]   I usually turn it off. I'm usually on analog. I don't want to have to think while I'm figuring out the time and
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   I'm just like sick. So I do actually have to think if I I know it's
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.720]   You want a pie face or you want a digital face?
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.680]   I like a digital like you know like the numbers. I like to see the analog number
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.320]   I want to see numbers so I don't have to think yeah
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.360]   I want it quite easy. Well, because otherwise you have that
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.240]   You have that thing of any time up use someone asks you the time and you look at your watch and you're like
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.360]   You're trying to room like it happens inevitably like you're trying to remember what how to read a big hand
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.600]   You don't want to do I don't know what they do in the UK
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.120]   But they teach it this way the big hand is on the three
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.440]   And the little hand is in between the three and the four
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.560]   Do they teach it that way in the UK?
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.800]   They do but it knew when a stranger asks you for the first time
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.520]   It's hard to figure out you forget the whole thing, right?
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.560]   My kids
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.680]   My kids did not know how to tell time from a pie face. I don't think I think young people no longer
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.240]   Even know what that looks like. It's all
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.080]   Takes you to calculate you want to get the time over with so you can go on with your day
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.600]   Faster it's 352 but I'm going to make a case because I'm an old man for the pie face
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.320]   it gives you a sense of
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   Progress of where you stand in the hour and where you stand in the day. There is there is a sense of
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.040]   uh, you know like distance
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.400]   Digital you have to kind of I don't know. I'm just this is a number
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:07.280]   Uh, so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna counteract you with what is by far the best apple watch face
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.080]   Which is the the time in numbers?
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   Yeah, and your your next calendar item underneath yes. Yeah, and then you know it calls info
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.120]   What you're doing next that's the info face
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.320]   One as well. I love I think will it's 100% right. He's I'm sorry Leo
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.960]   Your day is your calendar
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.680]   Yeah, there we go all three of us
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.000]   I have the calendar. I have what I have to do next and I have the date
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.240]   What else do I need to know my day is set and I will always see this
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   Get all my lawn
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.280]   I also use a fountain pen and write in cursive
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.240]   Sounds cool though fountain pens are awesome
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.920]   Takes a while. It's and then I take a picture of it and I paste it into the email and I said
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.000]   digitally
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.600]   I used to I used to support people in it who would have their secretaries print out their emails so that they could read
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.160]   That was the thing. Yeah
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   So, I'm not surprised. Well, he always told me he does that
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.800]   He was the former editor in chief of the seversus co-examiner
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.600]   He would have his emails printed and I think that was it was almost a ceo move like well. I'm sorry
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   Yeah, I don't oh it was a it's a total ceo move. I've seen
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.920]   Very senior people who will print something off
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   Scribble a note on it and yes back to the set yes and then be like this is this is my comment yes
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.480]   the
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.560]   The better way of achieving the same thing was it was a tricker. I learned off
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.040]   Of Kevin rose about 10 years ago. Yeah
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   You I'm sure I don't think he'll mind if I out to him who said that nobody minds getting like quick replies
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.320]   If they know they've come from your phone. Yeah, so he just set his
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.400]   Desktop signature to always say sent from my iPhone
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.640]   I like it on word replies and nobody would get
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:04.560]   Oh, that's and no one here typos, you know sentences that are short take long
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:11.600]   That's very smart to this day. That's what I that's what that's how I do there used to be and I guess they don't exist anymore
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.120]   There used to be sites two sentences dot es
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.720]   because so spain three sentences four sentences
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.600]   And it was a site where it said I only put four sentences in my email
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.280]   So this is all you're gonna get and you would put that as your signature block
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.520]   I think Kevin told me about that too. I think Kevin was really big into not answering email
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.440]   Come to the thing of it. I understand it. Yeah, we got a lot of emails and it saves time
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.720]   Yeah, I just ignore honestly. We're all just trying to wait emails
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:46.160]   Like that's why they print out the emails. I have I have created a mythology around me that I don't read email
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.680]   Which has been very helpful for me for years. I do read email, but I want anybody to know it
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.560]   Right speaking of saving time ceramic is back in the series
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Now, okay, so amazing segue. There's four count of four materials. You got your cheap aluminum
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.720]   Come on, man. You got your probably surgical stainless steel
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:15.360]   That's heavy by the way. That's the heaviest. I think you got your titanium. That's a little lighter heavier than aluminum
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.560]   Or as you fellas over there say aluminium
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:24.000]   But lighter than stainless steel and then ceramic is that how you say it?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.960]   ceramic ceramic
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   ceramic
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.920]   I believe it's ceramic anyway, but the ceramic is white
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.120]   Yeah
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.960]   It's white and the titanium comes in two colors. I got okay
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.360]   I almost hate to admit this because it's kind of a 1% or move. I got the titanium
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.480]   With the link, which is like a $400
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.520]   Band, which is crazy. You gotta stop you Leo, but I just thought it would look nice
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   It's so stupid
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.360]   You know the real the real 1% to move Leo, which I have admit that I have done
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.880]   um
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.600]   Is you buy both the stainless steel
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.480]   Like steel and the stainless steel gold so it matches whatever accessories you're wearing
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.680]   Okay, now that's a look that's a lot. Yeah, that's a that was a condensed move
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:26.640]   Yeah, that's very kind of I have heard stories of people having day and night watches too like
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.640]   That was when the dad every life didn't serve right? You couldn't you couldn't get through the day
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.720]   So uh
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.760]   399 starting price for the alum aluminium
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:42.800]   And it goes up. I think it's like a thousand bucks again for the addition versions. Yeah. Yeah, those are expensive
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:49.120]   Yeah, well, the the first edition as in the first edition editions were like 10k, right? Oh, no 20
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.680]   The gold the 24 karat gold. Yeah, it was like
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.760]   Knowledge so it's like a thousand for the ceramic white looks like a positive bark in right?
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.200]   I realized what a stupid move it is when they started I thought oh well
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.720]   They won't come out with another one next year and they do so I realized you should just get as cheap as possible when you can get
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.120]   Yes, there's definitely no shame. No shame at all get the cheapest
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:16.480]   Especially with you you're gonna buy the next watch. Yeah, I'm ashamed. I'm I'm
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.280]   By the cheap watch get the nice link like that's the thing. Yeah, get the nice band
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.160]   No one can tell the difference between titanium and the brushed the brushed titanium and the aluminum
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.440]   Does not show any difference. No, really they're a little different, but I don't know me
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.720]   I don't know they look the same. I I don't know maybe in person
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.120]   They look a little bit more different, but I wouldn't know the difference
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.040]   So they'll just think you bought the cheap watch anyways and you didn't
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.680]   All right, everybody
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.960]   I feel like it's a smart move just because apple is catering to the to the high end watch fanatic
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:54.160]   That's that's what they pay for so apples just like oh, we're just gonna charge this every year
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.960]   They're gonna keep buying it. Yeah, it's a fashion project who needs you know
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.360]   Who needs 10 different Rolexes that have got a slightly different color of some marinor blue
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:12.000]   But you know you have them because you because you want them, right? Okay real quick because we've so we've so worn out our welcome with this apple tuck
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   I just want to go through a couple more things
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:19.040]   I was excited apple arcade five bucks a month starts this thursday
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:27.120]   Yeah, I think that's good. I think five bucks a month for a hundred games all new knowing no microtransactions all downloadable
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:34.400]   You can play them on the airplane that's all exclusive like half of them are also exclusive to the service entirely and all them are exclusive to
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.240]   iOS in some form. So that's pretty impressive. You had me at frogger
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.320]   Honestly, they showed frogger, but there's a giant baby now. So it's better. Yeah
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:54.240]   Perhaps the low point of that whole demo was like, oh man, we're talking about next generation arcade streaming and this really scripted really
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.560]   Stilted demo of frog
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.520]   Yeah
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.520]   Then frogger with the giant baby
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.440]   Uh
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.880]   No, I think I think this is gonna be a one forever. I think they're gonna do well with that. Don't you
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.520]   I'm excited about it. I'm one of those people that that I
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.120]   Game a lot on my, you know, I did they are and then I use my phone
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.200]   That's pretty much the way that I game so
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.880]   And then apple tv plus apple showed how un how less confident it is about apple tv plus
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.280]   Announcing first that it's 499 a month
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.200]   Which is lower than any of the other subscription services because they have less content. They
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.320]   Showed three shows
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.720]   I don't understand but then yeah as if that were enough
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:43.520]   And they said but if you buy anything it's free. Yeah, that's the lower move. That's it. That's it. Yeah
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.840]   Buy anything just buy something. We'll give it to you
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.560]   You can't you can't charge anything for six shows. How can you charge?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.240]   The chances of you liking any of the six shows
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.200]   Is infinitesimal you have been looking for the shows great
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.000]   You can even buy an ipod touch and you get a free free year
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   That's so little confidence
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.480]   I'm excited if you bought like an apple t-shirt and you got it
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.240]   Anything
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.480]   Buy a watch now. It's free. I will say they'll you like I don't think this is a sign
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.560]   It's just free for the first year. Just be free. Yeah
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:27.200]   It's not a sign lack of confidence like they are bulldozing their way into this market in the best way like in the way
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.520]   They know how so for for them to get any dent they need to get as many subscribers as they can in their first year
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.520]   And this is the way to do it. Just make it the default
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.760]   Yeah, don't you think to venture that if they had just made it free free like everyone gets it
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:46.800]   We we're in we like it and then you start to make it like then we subscribe to it afterwards when they have a little bit more
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.080]   Things six. I don't know if you start if you start with free
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:55.040]   As we as you're offering and then you start charging then people freak out then people get annoyed if it's like
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.000]   It's free for this year if you buy this thing then you know the deal you know what you're getting into so I feel
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.960]   That feels at least a little more honest and transparent about what's happening. It also plays into apples like whole service pricing offering
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.400]   Anyway, like the pricing of iCloud for like something that's so outdated
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:16.480]   It's like completely ludicrous and it's like I'm paying you know 10 bucks a month or something for some stories
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.640]   You don't even know how much you get or why you get it or where it is on the phone
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.600]   I just hope my back was just all over the place. Yeah, exactly
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:32.400]   Um, and I don't know why that isn't rolled in. Why is that the tv service not part of like just my apple service
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.800]   I feel like there should be a larger bundle and I think there might be a larger bundle
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:40.000]   It's everything because you've got apple news plus for 10 bucks
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.960]   Way overpriced you've got uh, iCloud wait for whatever. No one knows way overpriced
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:53.920]   You know definitely that much you've got uh apple music. That's something worthwhile. Maybe what's that 1599 for family
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:59.520]   Uh, 10 bucks for uh individual. What if you said 25 bucks you get everything something like that
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.880]   Yeah, apple ultimate like a microsoft is doing that with the xbox live plan and game pass
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.400]   And really selling that as the ultimate thing and that's that's great
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   That kind of works. I think so
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   I wouldn't be surprised if we see that next year
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   Like there's so much stuff for them in the month is a is a system seller man. That is
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:21.200]   Incredible value. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's kind of I guess what apple wants to do with arcade plus
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.800]   If you're not in the apple ecosystem if you're one of those people sitting at home saying why are they talking about apple all this time
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:35.440]   Does apple tv plus have any draw for you at all? No, I don't think tv plus does but I think apple arcade does like a hundred titles
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.760]   All of them sound really compelling
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.040]   Um
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.440]   Yeah, just just looking at them on paper
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.520]   These are games I want to play and I don't normally want to like devote time to mobile games
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.160]   But they actually have really interesting developers and really cool artists involved with this whole service
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.760]   And I think that's really interesting. So people would jump on board for that
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.560]   This one's kind of for you to vendor because you covered this with slash film your podcast about film
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:05.280]   Apparently according to the hollywood reporter apple offered jj abrams half almost half a billion dollars
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.520]   To for a production deal with bad robot, which he turned down
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.840]   And ended up going with 18 t's Warner media for less
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.760]   Wow five-year deal for for 250 million
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.400]   But the source has said it was apples offer was almost twice as
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.360]   Much that show that's a problem for apple if they can't whoo these guys
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.680]   Um
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.120]   For whatever reason and I don't know if it's a content issue
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.640]   If it's it was an exclusivity issue
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.520]   They didn't want he didn't want the exclusive he would have been allowed to work on
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.600]   Star Wars or star trek or other tv projects. So
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.000]   But you pay a lot for that exclusivity i'd be exclusive for half a billion
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.280]   But he has enough money that he doesn't care he wants to have his like creative freedom
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.880]   He like really money is not probably his biggest issue
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.960]   And in fact, it's surprising that apple made that offer like that shows
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:07.840]   Perhaps a little naivete about how hollywood works that they would say okay jj, but we want you and you alone
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.080]   It's very much silicon valley coming in like here's here's money. Here's a ton of money
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.360]   Uh, forget your artistic ambitions or your creativity
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:19.760]   Like just just take the money just take the money come work for us live in our kingdom
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   Well, and that's jj's grunts great relationship with with with disney right like producing the star wars films
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.320]   You've got to imagine he's gonna have some star was involved in going forward
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.560]   And we already saw this week bob i
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.720]   Resigned from the board of apple right because of a conflict of interest over apple tv plus and and disney plus
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.000]   So, uh, you've got a good question. Yes, some issue there
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.600]   Yeah, i'm sure there's something going on to with disney like trying to keep him
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.880]   Around or available so there's a lot
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.200]   Um, also, I think these stories reported like he could potentially be getting more money from atent
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   As well like through other types of deals or other other other financial incentives
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.520]   So it's not just the cash that he's probably looking at
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.080]   Uh, there are potential
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.760]   The hollywood reporter says bad robots can develop not only film and tv but video games
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:11.840]   And digital products because of course warner includes hbo the new hbo max service
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   I mean if you're a creator
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.120]   Yeah, that's a much better even if the dollars are less that's a much better long-term offer
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.240]   So I can kind of understand that and he's working with apple he's doing, uh
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.920]   Three shows at apple but they're but through warner
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.320]   So yeah
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.000]   Now so like there may be some content restrictions too like I don't think apple's doing
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.680]   That's what I was wondering adults. Yeah, like it all seems like kind of family oriented
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   No swearing
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   That's right. So you want to
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.880]   You want to be creative and be able to you know produce whatever you feel like you want to produce
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.200]   I think that that at his stage in his career is probably not very appealing
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.480]   Remember do you remember the word convergence?
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.640]   For 10 years
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.440]   Yeah, that was the whole thing and I know you do well was the convergence of hollywood and silicon valley
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:09.280]   That's going to be an amazing match made in heaven and it has never really worked. It's never really come off as it
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   It's too very different culture because yeah
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.960]   Yeah, the cultures are completely different, you know silicon valley when I was running channel flip
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.880]   Used to run this all the time, right?
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.640]   Which is that people at youtube are driven by algorithms and the creators that make stuff are driven by creativity
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.400]   And it's like people talking to completely different languages
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.960]   And they just they just don't get it and I don't think they you know, there is just nothing that will overcome that that clash
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.920]   Seems like it's still a problem

[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:43.680]   This is as bad as it can get and we heard this was going to happen, but it came down only california in alabama
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.080]   Are not in this 50 us states and territories announced a broad eddy trust investigation
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.280]   Of google the pile on continues
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.960]   Um, but the toughest thing is it seems to be there different constituencies texas attorney general
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.920]   Ken pakston says
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.760]   You know, they're worried about google's left leaning slant
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:16.640]   Uh, they're focused on online advertising and censorship they dominate the buyer side the seller side the auction side the video side with youtube
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.920]   Uh, some are worried about monopoly some are
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.480]   It's it's a complicated thing and it's an interesting coalition
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   How worried should google be?
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.760]   How about we start with you will from across the pod because the eu
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.560]   Has also been pretty critical of google another big, uh, and you're fine
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.480]   Yeah, I think the the answer is probably not that worried
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.960]   I mean if you've got 50 50 us states and territories the chances of
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.440]   Coordination between a bunch of people who are you know, are going to be fundamentally
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.800]   Unaligned as you say there are people in texas who want to go after it for left leaning bias
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.560]   People on the left who want to go after it for being a monopoly that's you know, that's that's a capitalist disaster
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.840]   Like you're not going to get anybody to agree on anything and I think
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:14.560]   If you so at the state level, I think you know from from you know my rudimentary understanding of american politics
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.800]   It's going to be disaster and then if you look at the federal level
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.960]   Look at what the you know the kind of level of fine that facebook has been getting for stuff that arguably is far more egregious
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.480]   And the completely free pass it's getting on you know, electioneering
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:32.640]   I don't think there's there's you know, there's any hope that there's going to be any regulation or any kind of penalty
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.440]   That's going to incite a meaningful change in behavior in in these people
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.320]   Was there was to make you so much money doing it?
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.640]   mm-hmm
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.400]   it does feel like uh
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.440]   Facebook's kind of no longer in the spotlight the
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.920]   The eye of soron has turned to google and amazon all of a sudden there's still investigations being like, uh, I think
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.000]   Who's it?
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.880]   New york attorney general. Yeah, let's just james. Yeah, it's still pursuing something against facebook
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.080]   So it's like everything is being looked at now
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.360]   But the key is like google and facebook are now both under fire
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:15.840]   I don't know if this like this seems so haphazard like 50 different states and a lot of different things like they're there
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.400]   Too many ideas and there are too many
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   People pursuing different angles for any of this they really have much of an effect
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.760]   But I like seeing the government the state governments and the federal government paying more attention to these companies
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.480]   They just need a more a smarter and more concerted effort and way to like
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.680]   Actually a hold them account for when things go wrong
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.560]   I'm surprised. Yeah, you don't have a lot of comfort
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.160]   You don't have a lot of confidence that the lawmakers really understand
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.200]   Nope the detail of what they're really going for right like it feels a little bit like the internet is made of tubes or over again, right?
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.720]   And actually worry
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:01.280]   Because I feel like any move to break up google would only lead to disaster
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.920]   I mean, I don't i don't deny that I look at google
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.120]   I look at youtube right now when I see disaster like honestly like
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.080]   It depends on how should they be forced to divest youtube is that is that the kind of thing you think?
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.640]   if I if I was if I was a
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.160]   As a stock buying man
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:27.440]   The you know, I would be investing heavily right now in in google in facebook because if you break in amazon
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.280]   If you break those companies are money
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:35.040]   Yeah, if you like you unlock massive shareholder value you break aws out from amazon
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.000]   And you're gonna have you know, you know, absolute giant you break youtube off from google
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.040]   You're gonna have an absolute massive creation of shareholder value
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.040]   If anything the fact that you know, these investigations are ongoing should be assigned to to I mean
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.840]   No investment analyst hold my hands up, but like, you know, I would be bye bye bye
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:02.960]   I don't think that anyone has to worry right now because they're they're deciding they're opting to not put any
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.560]   You know major penalties up for them. So that's pretty much going to become a slap on the wrist
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:14.320]   I think that what google is really worried about is that they're going to put it regulations or which probably in the end is that's what's going to happen
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.880]   It's happening the
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.320]   Interesting it's going to happen
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:23.920]   It's just going to happen in a certain amount of time when people understand a little bit more about the internet and they become lawmakers
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.680]   But even with you you issuing like, you know, like nine billion in fines for google
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.200]   That's a slap on the wrist. That's like they make 40 billion a year
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.840]   Yeah, this is like three months of change for them
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.960]   So it's even that is nothing to them regulations
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.760]   They will care about and if anyone has to go to jail for anything that they will care about but until that happens
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:53.520]   Google yeah, and I I'll be honest. That's my feeling to it is that you know, you mess with people's privacy you try to you know,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.280]   mess in
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:01.040]   Elections that should be something that is a crime. You want my doctor bird to go to jail
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.600]   Yeah, one legislator actually have any reasons. Yeah, how's that? Yes? I think you should go to jail
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.320]   He's doing this for sure. I think but again, it has to be made a crime before he goes to jail
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.680]   But I think it should be a criminal offense to mess with
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.520]   elections
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.680]   Um in it because that ruins a democracy. I don't think that anyone's feeling that zuck is is doing this, you know for
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.880]   For anything but for profit
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.400]   Here's an interesting point of view from it with a machine
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.800]   Oh, sorry, but if you tampered with a machine you got caught tampering with an election you go to jail
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.200]   physically you'd go to jail, right?
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.440]   So digitally should be no difference. But wait a minute. He didn't he didn't say oh, I'm gonna mess with election results
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.640]   He just created a platform that allowed it to happen. Yeah
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.360]   And look the other way as he made a
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:57.040]   About it happening. You know about a crime that is happening or if you're company is the one that's propagating a crime that is happening
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.680]   Again, that should be a criminal offense
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.200]   Yeah, I mean look at the Cambridge Analytica story like we know they knew for a very long time
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.440]   Like there there's a lot of this where they they were responsible for this platform and did nothing
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.960]   And kind of let things continue as they were as they were going
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.880]   So I think there should be some way to stop that or at least punish them before allowing something like that
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.000]   I think it's really
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.240]   Yeah, it's bringing it back to the EU point, right?
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.720]   You know it makes the EU action of like making Microsoft unbundled internet
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.840]   Doesn't that seem so quaint
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.880]   Look at all the big threat to like the entire eK system was billion
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.560]   Years
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.120]   Well, but I think that's an interesting case because
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.760]   It turned out all of the storm and fury around prosecuting Microsoft
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.280]   For any trust not much happened and in fact Microsoft didn't continue to win
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080]   So it didn't really matter, right? I mean that was a way
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.600]   Don't you think that Microsoft prosecution by the DOJ and the EU was wasted time in the long run?
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:10.080]   Perhaps perhaps but I wonder how much of that kind of led to Microsoft not dominating his mic
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.080]   So you think it was successful in that sense that that it we don't know. Yeah, we don't know
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.600]   It kind of stopped their momentum. It is funny that we're talking about it
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.880]   I feel like the tech world moved on and Microsoft's
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.360]   Position as the dominant player in desktop operating systems didn't matter in a cloud environment and it had nothing to do with the EU
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.000]   Or the what it did was was create a huge
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.200]   Overhead at a time when you know, Microsoft should have been focusing on innovating and mobile innovating
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.800]   The internet's waste at a time. What it was actually doing was spending all this time like with lawyers in court, right?
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.920]   It was opportunity cost that they missed. Yeah, that's interesting
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:54.800]   It is funny that uh, Microsoft president brad smith is doing his book tour right now like he's everywhere and he's talking about like
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.920]   Yeah, regulating big tech and breaking a big tech and it's it's funny. It is funny how yeah
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.000]   The tables have turned a little just a little that seems to be the defensive posture when they're out of right?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.320]   That seems to be the defensive posture of silicon valley is like spank us please
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.480]   Don't throw me in jail, but spank us. Is that what's going on? What's going on?
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.200]   Every I mean everybody but mark Zuckerberg is saying yeah, we're bad. We're wrong
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:27.920]   But we can't we have to say that listen we if we've learned anything from from world war two appeasement does not work
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:35.520]   We at least have to look like we are trying to say mark Zuckerberg is hitler. I mean, is that where you are?
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.880]   I'm saying that we've learned that appeasing by saying you know what we're just gonna look the other way
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.840]   Please please try not to do that and if you do it again, please stop again. Oh, that's right
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.120]   Give him an inch. They'll take a mile and if you don't stop him, they'll keep going
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.640]   So we need to have at least if you are trying to go against it
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:58.960]   At least if they have a little bit of a thought of oh, this is illegal and there's gonna be a consequence because let's say it if
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.160]   People didn't stop us at stop signs. No one would go through it
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.040]   Like I would roll through every single stop sign. I'll just be honest here
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:12.160]   Um if a cop wasn't gonna stop me, I was gonna get a ticket
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.040]   It we have to have something in place and until the entire political system kind of gets with the technology
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:26.160]   And understands it enough to make regulations that matter and criminal offenses where criminal offenses would make sense
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:31.120]   Yeah, you know, we have to start. Yeah, but you you have to compare it
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.880]   I think the closest thing to to what we're seeing now is like
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:41.520]   Um, you know the unraveling of of the financial system in 2008 and how many people went to jail over that, right?
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.400]   You know, none of the CEOs of those companies
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.880]   Went anywhere and it's it's really hard to imagine anything
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.080]   You know any different template for action. Yeah
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.960]   You know
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:01.120]   Yeah, we need a fundamental restructuring of the way we think of business in the way we think of our economy
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.320]   Like that's this is a problem than emdemic to america
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.600]   I think the big thing is like the tech companies just did the best job of milking as much capital
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.760]   As they could out of this entire system and algorithms helped and everything helped and it didn't matter if there was
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.400]   Potential like issues along the way or human costs
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   Uh, because at the end of the day all that mattered was like yeah following the algorithm and getting as much profit as possible
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.960]   Interesting opinion piece this week in the new york times by a journalist rob walker
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:36.640]   Who points out that we can all you know scream about tech? He says there's really no tech backlash
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.280]   uh according to
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.760]   You know, I mean she had the f's ftc find facebook 5 billion, but at the same time the number of facebook accounts
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   Increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.240]   Uh, the company's app added a million new users every day
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.000]   In the united states revenue was up 28
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.240]   even with the find facebook recorded a profit of record profit of 2.6 billion dollars and
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.120]   He's saying we may know about this we may say there's a problem
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.760]   But it's not slowing us our use of google and facebook and amazon down by one with
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.440]   We talk a lot about privacy and smart speakers
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   Amazon has sold more than a hundred million echoes
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.160]   No, it's yep, you know, yeah
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.880]   So do we really care?
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.760]   Well, I think it's it's an echo of the old
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:36.720]   You know when it comes to to music right when everyone was saying oh, you know, we're it's sad that we're moving to this
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.920]   You know terribly lossy mp3 format and the adage was convenience trump's fidelity
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:48.240]   And I think in today's internet age like convenience is gonna trump privacy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah pretty much
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.000]   And I mean there are plenty of things too like we talk about with in tech circles
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.720]   We talk about basic ideas like privacy and kind of what's going on these companies, but i'm i'm amazed at how like
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.120]   typical users mainstream users don't hear about much of this stuff and
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.040]   I guess I shouldn't be surprised like I I'm surrounded by the media bubbles
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.720]   So I think like everyone thinks like I think and I should probably realize that's not the case
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.800]   I remember I was doing um shortly after after
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:22.320]   Uh the election I was holding some 1984 readings here the briclin public library and we had a great group of people
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.720]   That's cool. It was cool. It was a great discussion because we were like, oh man. What are we approaching here?
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.800]   And I talked to it was a great group of people like smart funny
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.880]   Thoughtful people who read the news and I was like, well, you know, this is really similar to um, you know
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:43.440]   the thing snoedon revealed and the you know global surveillance network that he kind of unearthed that our
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.320]   Governments are portraying or perpetuating and they didn't know anything about it
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.600]   They didn't hear about this story, but I do think people leave the news. I do think people think that
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.000]   There are I think generally are aware of privacy invasions and are a little nervous about voices systems
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.800]   I think there's a general sense of it. You know the the difference is in 1984
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.600]   Winston's tv was watching him right?
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.480]   Which and our smart speakers are listening to we are being listened to and watched all the time
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.760]   But what's different is not for the government. It's for commercial entities
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.560]   So that they can advertise and we want it
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.720]   Yeah, we're the ones putting these these smart speakers in our phone to eavesdrop upon us
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:33.280]   Happily, yes recently, but I think that devengers point of how like mainstream people don't are you know
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.200]   Really knowledgeable about what's happening
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.680]   It should be taught at the school and and to children so that they understand what they are
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.720]   You know that you're the product if you're not paying for something
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.680]   how google works what you put out there and
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:54.480]   It's something that you are paying and and people are making a semi-conscious choice to use it that I I know google's got a lot of information about me
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.720]   But as a result
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.880]   My google assistant is smart
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.880]   You know, I just installed the google home nest home hub max god these names are just oh boy
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.760]   It has a camera. Yep, and when I walk in front of it. It says highly, yeah
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.600]   It's like creepy. It knows me. Well, I and by the way, it asks you it asks you when you set it up
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.920]   Is that okay? And I said yes
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.960]   And it says here's your schedule it sees me it recognized me says here's your schedule. You're some stuff. You'd be interested in
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   I think that's great
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.360]   Yeah, I'm with you on that. I think
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.400]   Well, but so kars google does because they can show me ads, but so what it's not like they're gonna
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.320]   But it's not great down the doors in my house and arrest me. It's not a government
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.280]   Not yet, but that that's not it but this isn't about ads right like this is about
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:50.400]   You're like there's very little transparency of what they do with the information how much information that they take
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.720]   And and where it's being used. So yeah, that's it's wonderful
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.200]   I would love to have a digital assistant that was intelligent
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.480]   But would I trade my privacy and you know, do I trust google to be able to have that information?
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:09.920]   I want to cut google as far out of my life as is possible even if i'm using a you know sad duck duck go
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.480]   um browser system instead
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:19.280]   Little sad it's getting better. It's sad. Well, I admit I bought the facebook portal and I did not leave that in the oh, we oh
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:25.760]   Yo, we talked about this. It was like a month after all the facebook leaks. Yeah, no, it was a big mistake
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.320]   Oh, man, but I like this google thing and then not only that. Yeah, I could say
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.400]   And I did yeah, I want a slideshow of all the pictures and I said and and knows what everybody looks like
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.360]   I said you want lisa. Yeah, you want michael. Yeah, you want your son henry
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.440]   Yeah, you want? I checked the boxes of the people's faces with their names next to it
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.200]   Yeah, show me pictures with those people and now I have a lovely slideshow
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.640]   Because I have given google over 70 000 photos taken over the last 15 years
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.360]   And has a wonderful I see pictures from when the kids were really little it's great
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.080]   I think these features are great and you're asking what is google doing that's so bad with this stuff that I should think that when when
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.160]   Once we started realizing like oh amazon and other companies in google are
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.720]   People are actually listening to her voice clips to make this voice recognition tech better
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.320]   Which seems kind of obvious on the face whip, but they never admitted to that and they never told us exactly that was happening
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.360]   I I think we should be a little skeptical like what is
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.640]   Just for it to recognize your face like is a video clip being sent back to google
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:34.320]   Is somebody actually making sure like actually massaging the facial recognition? We don't know what's happening to this
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:41.040]   So I just that's the bigger problem when I got the home max nest thing. I also got a google hello doorbell
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.920]   Which I put in and it has face recognition and it says when you set it up
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:54.080]   Uh, you should probably be aware that some states this might be illegal, but would you like to recognize anybody walks up to your house
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.040]   And I said yes
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.560]   And I didn't check surveillance state. Yeah, baby
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.040]   Because I I have the right to know who's out there ringing my doorbell
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.480]   So it is the uh
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:13.520]   The amazon ring story like how insidious that that well, that's what I replaced
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   Yeah
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.800]   Integration
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.640]   Yes, so I don't want the police to have that information. I don't really care if google does
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.440]   Let's go
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.000]   Have to give it. Um, yeah one of these interesting things that I saw that people
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.840]   Sorry
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.880]   No, please I was gonna say um just just a really um a flippant thing was that people
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.920]   There's a day of action set up for I think it's um
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560]   October the 17th, maybe
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:49.520]   Uh, it was one of these things organized on reddit where um everybody has to click the wrong thing
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.320]   On captures to complete
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.040]   Yeah, those google captures now that pisses me off
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:01.120]   I do not want to help google figure out that there was a street sign across walk and uh
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.840]   Yeah, I think everything that isn't across walk completely defeat this sort of day-to-day man
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.840]   I thought that was a really nice idea just sort of drawing attention to the issue
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:15.040]   Everybody okay. What day is that because I'm doing that is that after we invade area 51 or before?
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:23.280]   Uh, it's off to area 51 because area 51 is my birthday. Um, so I'm really oh, it's friday. Oh good. Yeah, that's friday
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.680]   I'm uh
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.680]   See y'all in Nevada
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.520]   So my my husband wants to ask you leo
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.640]   So what happens if you're not dressed is google still like so?
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.320]   Or would you not do you not not care about that because
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.400]   No, that's not creepy either. I don't know
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.200]   Penis recognition it's face recognition
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.440]   Yes
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.040]   We don't know
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.000]   We don't know what's coming
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.320]   You don't know what they're they're doing with that information, but that's what makes who cares
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.200]   No, that's why we need regulation. I'm sorry when the oh when you who are so aware who does with security now and
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.640]   When you'll even say you know what I will take
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.680]   The easy route. That's why we need
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.360]   Government regulation to keep us safe because in the end
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.560]   Are weak. Let's say you should be terrified
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.040]   Are weak of the government getting involved in this in any form or fashion
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.960]   I'm actually
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.560]   No, they don't have access to the data
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.080]   Like I think that's the main thing like here's the thing if like if if
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.720]   Some of this data like some of the video footage from your google ness is being looked at by google engineer and the ac like oh, hey
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.160]   It's leo report. I love him. Oh, he's walking around to his house naked
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.480]   And put it on youtube and make let's go viral, baby
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.920]   I do because i'll be a millionaire when I sue google for that one
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:52.080]   I will I will say about don't you think i'm protected against that kind of thing in google's figure out they are the best at telling you
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:24:00.160]   What they are gathering yeah of all the companies you can go to google and they will say we have this clip and this clip and this
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.320]   You can see what they have all these things on you and and they they give you the choice of okay
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.720]   Now i've seen this maybe i can here's my front door question at the quent yeah, but the question is do you believe it?
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.120]   Yeah, that's what i was gonna say to the law
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.920]   Oh, they're not going to lie. Why would they lie?
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   Says my camera hasn't seen anyone new yet once they do return to the screen to categorize them
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:29.600]   This is people my doorbell sees and then here's this here's a link see who your camera already knows
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:35.200]   Apparently doesn't know anybody it says familiar face detection use this feature in compliance with the law
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.000]   Thanks, don't tell me with the laws depending on where you live you might need to get the consent of people visiting your home
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.920]   Do I have to put a sign up on my front door that says your uh face is being surveilled you are being recognized? I probably do
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.240]   And the camera yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.520]   Teacher camera it says teacher camera public right it's private property so we expect yeah
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.160]   Get off my porch. You don't like it
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.760]   Teacher camera who you know every time it sees him it gets better at recognizing their face or other body parts
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.200]   Tap a face to see how the camera did and if something's not right delete that picture from the group
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.240]   So i'm training google aren't i i'm saying
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.520]   And here's what here's what anybody comes to my door. Here's what they uh, here's what they look like
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.800]   There is is there any regulation of this because i am really literally helping google
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:32.640]   Identify my neighbors a surveil yes a surveillance state but at least like really you're working against kind of you if you commit a crime
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:39.600]   Public it'll be more chance that you know when the government takes over, you know surveillance of public streets
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.120]   You'll probably be they'll find you fast in this video
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.600]   We have signs everywhere that say you're on camera, right? You guys had a sign up releasing
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.840]   You're gonna be on camera. Mm-hmm
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.120]   But the truth is we don't have any face recognition stuff aimed at you
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.360]   Yeah, but one of the big questions is gonna be like what is is not what google is doing with the data
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:06.000]   It's what the the government is going to tell google to do with the data that they're not going to tell you about
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.560]   Right remember the whole scandal
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:17.040]   You know post 9/11 when you know the government forced all the phone companies to put you know logs into everything to collect all the call metadata
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.880]   And nobody found out about it for for years. So what's gonna happen?
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:28.640]   Tell me the so I just read as an example I read an article in the New Yorker this week that says forget it climate change is gonna happen
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.120]   We're all dead. So I ordered a book. I've ordered two books that to it said
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.960]   And you know what it made a strong case. Oh, great. You ordered
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.560]   Yeah, so I ordered books killed some trees on these books is written
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:46.640]   The worst case scenarios like their sea rise temperature rise
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.840]   So that I can plan for the next 30 years
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.240]   Where you know where I should live what I should do should I wear sunscreen that kind of thing?
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:58.640]   And I figured that's a sensible reaction to something that I can't
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   Change I don't know why I brought this up. There's a reason I brought this up. We see what you're afraid of now
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.800]   Uh, really care about I want to know what is the book for the worst case scenario
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   For all this face recognition and and like that. What is the what is the worst that we get a dictator in the white house?
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.080]   And then he does what with it?
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.440]   I think what's scary is that a lot of this stuff is happening and we can't
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.880]   I think we're moving faster than science fiction in some ways
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:33.360]   Who could have predicted like what happened with this past election and then our response to it isn't too like
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.640]   Say hey, maybe maybe we should do a redo
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.560]   Maybe we should do something about the fact that there was this weird interference
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.560]   There was like yeah a lot of things going on at once
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:52.000]   We don't have the mechanisms to respond to issues when they occur. So I don't think there's a simple fix for this
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.960]   But we talked about a little hound dog before it might like a little hound dog at the cafe that's burning
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.480]   And I'm going oh, yeah, yeah, I'm like that right? This is fine. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:08.640]   I do you think like I don't trust the government like intrinsically, but I do think like it's worth having
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.920]   Something we need regulations of some sort
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:18.000]   I think we will need like a federal department of data or something like that because like that scares that scares the hell out of me
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.280]   Yeah, but why what comes keeping your car secure? What is keeping like everything? We have to rely on in our food
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:33.120]   Perfect have made people safer and that was regulated and now there's like i'm not saying i'm with de vinjean that like the government
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   Is always going to do the right thing?
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:42.560]   But you know usually we vote the government in that we have chosen because of what they stand for and hopefully that is aligned with
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.000]   the culture the change and the technology that's of the time and when they do a good job they save lives and
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.760]   Seabelts is a great way of of you know in the states that they have them
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.400]   They do save lives and airbags save lives as well and when they make sure that cars are now safer than they ever used to be
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.560]   Because of different regulations that are there that can be great
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.800]   I'm not saying that it can't also go sideways, but I think that in most cases
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.920]   We want to trust the government officials that we have chosen to be elected to do the right thing
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:20.560]   Remember the car companies fought seabeltts. They fought all these safety additions to cars tooth and nail like they fought so hard
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:26.400]   To keep seabelt out because it's it's a little more cost for them even though it's literally saving people's lives
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:33.040]   So I I can I don't think we should ever just leave the really precious commodities in the hands of the people
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.280]   You know banking
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:41.200]   Easy though to say okay, you're but we're seabeltts and you don't go flying through the windshield. I don't know if it's that easy to say
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.800]   Well, here's what you do with data collection
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.840]   If you have it's really hard to do anything like like like a lot of the pressure around
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:54.720]   Yes, there was government regulation around seabeltts, but it became socially
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.200]   You know, it became a pure thing right you could see if someone wasn't wearing a seatbelt
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:03.120]   And it was almost like a peer pressure thing to get you to do it
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.800]   Long long while
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.120]   Yeah, one of the challenges with with data is like because it's so intangible
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.360]   We can't see
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.680]   You know the lack of it or we can't see where it's going
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:18.400]   We can't see that there is a seatbelt or there's not a seat belt. We've got no idea what the heck is going on
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:24.720]   Um, so it's really hard to kind of to have any kind of visibility over it. Let's just meanwhile
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.280]   There are people who are spending
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.160]   685 pounds on an e-sanlon raw backpack
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:35.840]   With google sensors built into it. This is google's jacquard
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.240]   I don't even know what this is. Well, how much is 685 pounds? Will it's a lot of money
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.160]   $100,000. Yeah, yeah for a backpack
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.160]   There's two
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.480]   That's so much for an e-sanlon
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.800]   Uh, it's uh, I don't know it's these sensors. They're in there
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.600]   Well, it probably tells you where it is, right? It's probably like GPS
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   No, no, I wish it were
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.440]   you hover your hand over the
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.720]   strap to skip music
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.520]   except or dismiss calls
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.480]   Oh, yeah, like their jean jacket. They did
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.040]   Yeah, it's a sensor
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.000]   Oh, it's like those kind of like the like we get for snowboarding
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.960]   Yeah
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.280]   Yeah
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.080]   Well, that's that's just local. That's there's no data collection there. I think I think that's just like a trigger
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.240]   Oh, well, then this is fine. I'm gonna get one
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.200]   Yeah, this for things fine
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:36.160]   But leo to what you're saying when there are issues when there are issues like if there's a data breach
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.680]   We've seen so many companies just kind of just kind of hide it. It's kind of say, oh, yeah
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   We'll talk about this in a couple of months or something in the fcc. But thanks. Thanks to GDPR now. That's not the case
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.040]   And so now it hasn't every doesn't affect us in the us
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.920]   Well, but enough companies do business overseas that
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:32:00.000]   Every week we hear about two or three more data breaches last week. Yeah, it's great 400 million. F. Why is it great? What do you do about it?
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.400]   We I mean, well, first of all, you're made aware of it. It's it's not it's like we were saying like I don't expect the consumer
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:12.080]   I think what happens really is people just go. Yeah, another data breach and go on with their lights like what there's nothing you can do about it
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.800]   You can't but the whole thing
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:17.760]   Yeah, it's not even embarrassing for the companies anymore
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.080]   Yeah, but the whole thing Leo is that you know, we have GDPR regulations because there was pressure
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.600]   To you understand more about what people are doing with data
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.800]   I understand this is my it's it's the poster boy for nothing maybe no
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.400]   It's the poster boy. No
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:43.760]   No, over here. So over here. We've had to do like I mean, okay now. I have to click every time I go to a site
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.840]   Yes, I know you use cookies
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.160]   What?
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:53.600]   Yeah, there were there's a lot more insidious stuff that was going on particularly with ad tech before GDPR
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.160]   and you know if you follow
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.360]   You know a lot of ad tech blogs, you know the way that GDPR has impacted you use data has been pretty
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.920]   You think it's been on the balance. It's been good
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.120]   It definitely has been good on the balance now dude consumers
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:15.360]   See, you know the effect on the consumer is having to click a sodding pop-up thing every time we go onto a website
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.760]   But behind the scenes
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.760]   This whole thing. It's a bad UI
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.520]   But behind the scenes it's made a huge difference to the way that ad companies
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:31.040]   Including google think about data collection and at least it's the starting point for a conversation
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:36.240]   About how we should be doing data, you know, is it is it better to have no GDPR at all?
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:39.280]   Okay, maybe there's no, you know massive outcry
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.920]   But you know when something goes wrong
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.840]   But at least there's something there as a mechanism to hold some degree of accountability and maybe going forward
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.800]   We can build on it and have GDPR version two but put suck a bug in jail. Right. There's gonna be
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:34:00.720]   So cleaner and like these things can get insidious really quickly, right? We've seen that whole iPhone
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:10.080]   Browser hacking story is insane like how deep that goes and like that was that was targeting the minority weaker Muslim population in china
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.160]   Like that's terrifying like we we need better mechanisms
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:22.080]   Worldwide to deal with this stuff, but the very least I think like GDPR was a start it the us needs similar sorts of regulations
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.080]   I think we need stronger
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.280]   The stronger federal departments to deal with this stuff too like that
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.800]   One go
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:34.960]   What you just said that the only reason we know about that i find exploit is because of google
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:41.440]   Yes, because of google. Yeah, because yeah because but it's not proving anything wrong
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.960]   Like i'm saying it's it's still a very insidious thing if we like I do think we rely on
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.120]   Googles doing a better job of monitoring apple than the us federal government
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.640]   They understand it more but we rely on the cia to you know filter international
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:04.320]   Chatter to see like where the potential you know terrorist attacks like what are the potential dangers to the us what things could happen in the world
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.240]   I don't think it's too much as I think we need something on that level to
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.440]   Deal with the data that's actually happening around us and like the vulnerabilities that data opens up
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.880]   Basically, yeah, and and no parent no company will police itself like that's absolutely impossible
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.600]   That never happens and that's for any company of any sort
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.040]   Your first thought is to protect yourself something bad happens in your company your first thought will be
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:34.240]   How do I protect myself from this instead of how to make sure that I follow the law to do the right thing?
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:40.960]   So because of that we need some sort of oversight that comes from outside of all all agencies
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.040]   Period government agencies computer, you know companies
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.120]   Because it's impossible our our base nature is protection and save ourselves
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:36:00.720]   It's a horrible thing to say but we are you know altruistic after the fact not really during the moment when there's a shortage of something or we're in our own harm
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   Let's take a little break our show
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.680]   Today on the twit network follows a week of fun and games
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.120]   We have made a fabulous little short movie for you to see what you missed watch
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:19.120]   Previously on twit when you were at the grand canyon. Did you do they have rules against drones?
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.440]   Sending drones out and getting footage allegedly they have rules, okay
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.240]   But no, I didn't I didn't fly to drone this time. Okay, I did take the dogs and let the dogs run around and they enjoyed
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.400]   So you let the dogs out I did
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:43.440]   Twit live specials. There's the apple 2019 event. There is a new iPhone the iPhone 11 the iPhone 11 pro and the iPhone 11 pro max
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.800]   All about android
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.680]   Pixel four leaks coming in strong assistant is gonna be able to step in for you while you're on hold apparently
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.800]   Uh and notify you when a human is on the other end. It's like we're gonna put you on hold and make you wait
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.840]   Oh, yeah, well, I'm gonna put your hold on hold and make you wait
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.400]   Uh, which I can I can get behind that
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:10.720]   Security now deep fakes has been in the news a lot Facebook and Microsoft just announced an initiative to
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.360]   Work on sort of counter AI that would be able to do deep fake detection
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:24.800]   Tech news weekly. It's a funny thing that HTC has come forward with the HTC Vive cosmos
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.800]   You're not setting up webcams. You're not setting out tracking boxes
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:36.000]   Online is you plug this into the pc and that's it to it now also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.080]   But not corpse purple are you gonna buy that new uh, Vive Georgia?
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:49.840]   No, actually we're not going to we're not even buying the Vive index. We got the um knuckles controllers, which are amazing
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.240]   Knuckles are they for sonic and knuckles? What are they for? No here wait? Oh, let me just grab
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.000]   A little demo of the knuckles controllers
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.120]   While george is getting her knuckles controllers. I showed it a brought to you by w w t
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.880]   Real wide technology and their advanced technology center
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.720]   They started building this 10 years ago
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.520]   It actually filled a gap because it used to be I remember we worked
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.720]   At the ziff davis labs in foster city and there were these labs and we would do all these reviews
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.480]   But that went away. Where do you go now if you're enterprising? You want to know is this going to work with what i'm using already?
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   How do I incorporate net app or siskor?
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.960]   VMware into my system. How does it's an amazing lab half a billion dollars of equipment
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:41.760]   Hundreds of oem's key partners ranging from heavyweights like net app sisko and vm where to emerging disruptors like tanium and equinix and expanse
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.760]   This is a this lab is used by ww t's engineers
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.760]   To beta test new equipment to build reference architectures
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:57.600]   To set up custom integrations for ww t customers to help those customers make the right decisions to see what's going to happen to see results
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.240]   With a lot less investment
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.680]   It's really an incubator for it innovation on demand and schedule will uh labs
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.800]   I'll give you an example net app cloud volumes on tap
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.400]   On tap on flash net app disaster recovery as a service
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.920]   You could try all of these out you can see is this right for me is this going to work in my enterprise along with hundreds of other labs
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:21.520]   Representing the newest advances and things like flash storage
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.640]   Multi cloud hyper converged infrastructure cloud data management
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.160]   You need to learn about these products before you launch them
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:36.320]   Ww t's engineers use these environments to spin up proofs of concept and and pilots. They have a sandbox
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.080]   That way customers could choose the best solution, but here's the best part
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.320]   They now offer lab as a service a dedicated lab within the atc
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:50.720]   Where customers can do their own programmatic testing using this half billion dollar ecosystem
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:56.080]   Ww t is built and because it's virtual you don't have to go to st. Louis you can use it anywhere in the world
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.480]   anytime 24
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.760]   7
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.400]   This digital platform is so cool is now launched
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.000]   It covers the entire advanced technology center ecosystem
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:14.480]   And man, it is the it is a multiplier for knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere around the world for their customers
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:19.760]   You get access to articles to case studies you get those hands-on labs you get tools that can make the difference
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.880]   And today's world things are changing fast. You need
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:32.240]   The atc you need ww wt to learn more about worldwide technology their advanced technology center and to sign up for access to their new on-demand lab platform
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.360]   All you got to do is go to w w t dot com slash twit
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.240]   W w t dot com slash twit w wt simplifies the complex
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.120]   W w w t dot com slash twit
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.240]   Worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes all over the world
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.280]   That is awesome. Hey, if you apply for the hundred twenty five dollars in Equifax
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.480]   Refund
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.480]   You got more to do kids
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.320]   I love this register article you
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.960]   If you put in the hundred twenty five dollar claim, by the way, you're ain't gonna get hundred twenty five dollars
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.880]   But if you put in a ten twenty five dollar claim, you got an email on friday
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.000]   That says validate or amend your claim in it Equifax explains even though
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   You found out about its settlement, which they didn't want you to know about you found the online address where you had to apply
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.120]   Even though you inputted all the details you were asked for even though you selected to take the cash option
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:35.440]   You're not done you now need to give them more information quote your claim will not be received by the settlement administrator
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:42.320]   Until you click the submit button after your electronic signature for security reasons once you hit submit
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.000]   You will not be able to make any changes to your claim form
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.600]   You have to october 15th to reconfirm
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:59.120]   I did it. Did you really I can't wait to see the checks for 53 cents you get exactly I don't care what money i'm getting
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.320]   It's just gonna do it to just take it to the man something
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.320]   Uh the problem is it's a giant it's a pool
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:13.040]   Well, here's the problem in ftc announced the five hundred seventy five million dollar settlement in july
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.480]   Of the five hundred seventy five million dollars they they earmarked a hundred twenty five million
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:24.480]   To compensate you and me and everybody who was affected by the Equifax breach
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.440]   Oh, but wait a minute
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.800]   In fact
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.880]   Those were the headlines, but in fact ftc has only really agreed to 31 million dollars
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.120]   A pot of money that will split equally among all the people who apply
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:44.240]   Yeah, if only a quarter of a million people out of the hundred seventy five million people affected apply
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.280]   Then you'll get a hundred twenty five dollars per person
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:55.120]   So i'm glad about this this thing if only one in four no no i'm sorry
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:01.760]   What is that four times 175 if one in like 650 applies then you get 125 bucks
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.800]   But it but it goes down fast
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   More people apply you're right
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.560]   Like the fdc is woefully equipped to deal with this problem
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:19.040]   About government intervention. Do we need a difference of agency? We need something I think that maybe understands the issue more and can actually
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:25.600]   Implement harsher penalties because right now all the fdc can really do is give them fines that don't matter
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.960]   And that nobody they don't actually have to pay basically like people aren't getting compensated
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:36.480]   So a little math if a million people out of the hundred seventy five million apply will you get 31 dollars
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.360]   But karstin if everybody who's eligible applies you'll get 21 cents
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.680]   I'm rich
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.960]   That's the postcard to send you the money will cost more
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:55.040]   Yeah, you know, I just I agree we
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:00.080]   Feels like we should do something but i'm afraid that anything we do is going to be the wrong thing and it's going to make it worse
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.800]   I just feel like that's the problem
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.560]   Uh, let's talk about something nice and happy the pixel four
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.200]   What do we know because divin or anything? I mean there's a lot of leaks
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.920]   When when is this gonna be announced?
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.800]   I've been mostly iPhone focus. So sorry do not have no this is that that's what happens right?
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.720]   But now you can pivot your attention. Yeah, iPhone's over
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:32.560]   It's pixel time. It's pixel time pixel time. I think the most notable thing about the the pixel four and the amount of leaks
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.200]   And it's like yes, it's got you know, okay great camera great, you know all those extra things
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:44.640]   I think the thing for me that is the most interesting about the pixel four is like how much more integrated and how much
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.280]   How much better how better run?
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.880]   Um, the the google assistant is compared to syri it really is like it's it's kind of unbelievable
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:03.120]   How far i hate you know as a bit of an apple fanboy. I hate saying it but like how woefully bad syri is compared to google assistant
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:07.360]   I mean they and i don't know more people by pixels the camera is better the assistance better
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.320]   What why has you're in the ecosystem right?
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.240]   But the you know, I think we just saw in that promo for all about android
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.280]   Well, they've got you know the the feature that will put you put the if you're on if you're on hold on a call
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.720]   You went to one come yeah, i'll tell you when someone's come back and it's like how you know
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.720]   I can barely get apple to to to call my mom at the right
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.840]   It's true and it's like it's true
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:39.760]   How how is good, you know the fact is the google is collecting it all this stuff and it is making those products better and the pixel four will be
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.680]   You know will be a better product because you've got that camera, you know on your porch
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.760]   And you know, I think it's it it is it is interesting that well, so we talk about all the stuff about data
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.200]   Like when you're talking about the interesting new things on the pixel four
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.240]   Um for me that the assistant stuff is is like the most interesting stuff
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:08.720]   Microsoft go ahead it makes a huge difference too like I have to say using series is it series a painful painful experience
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.440]   Every time I speak to what you're saying and grade it to make it better
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.720]   But they're they're not spending the time where they should be 100
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:24.400]   And you know, I I do sometimes think that she's she suffered a head injury or something's wrong with her every time I speak with her
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:33.360]   Um, whereas google's assistant is brilliant and go home. Siri you're drunk. Yeah. Yeah, there's something she needs a little bit of help
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.800]   You know, but i mean that's the point. Siri needs to tell me when to go home because i'm drunk
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.000]   Like google assistant can do that in
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.320]   Siri you're wrong go away
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.800]   I would like it definitely it has more to do with like the way those two assistants work too right?
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.040]   Siri is more like locally based like a lot of the processing is happening on your phone
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.480]   Uh
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.760]   The the sound the the voice recognition isn't as good even though they're still using some of the cloud based things I believe
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.360]   from nuance
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.320]   Whereas google assistant is very much cloud based like it's doing all that work and very quickly
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.800]   So google has done that work basically to make all that region work and that
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.560]   Mm-hmm max man that thing I could say let me see my front door. It goes. Hi leo
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:24.480]   How you doing? Here's what you're doing today. It's gonna be a nice day, but she should bring an umbrella. It's great
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:28.560]   I love it. It knows everything you're looking great. You're looking great kid
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.160]   I don't know why they don't put more of that in there man. You look good today leo personality
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.960]   Yeah a little personality. I well we're gonna get that. Yeah, I know I have john legend
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:44.080]   It's uh my google voice is john legend. You know you could do that right. Oh really? Oh, yeah
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.720]   So john legend greets me in the morning
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.280]   Yeah, that's great. I'd rather have krissey tigen, but okay. I'll take john legend. It's okay. It's not
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.800]   They both have great voices. They need more variety to be honest in the uh in the voices
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.920]   There's there's so much more potential to have fun with those things too
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.680]   I was just using ways on a family trip and I made the voice cookie monster
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:12.320]   It's fun. It's fun and my my daughter left it even though she didn't turn right now. Yeah
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:15.760]   Also ways doesn't keep those voices and they go away
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:22.000]   Tom Tom. Yeah. Yeah, john's home was doing that like 10 years ago. Yes. Yeah, mad that we haven't like
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.240]   I had tennis hoppers voice on my tom tom and it was so funny
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.920]   He's like you've arrived. Why would anyone want to go here? It was just
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:39.040]   It was so stoned out and wild and then remember how do you I had a how do you do one that told you to turn the wrong direction?
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.040]   Yes, portal
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.680]   There was a gladdus remember the portal game where gladdus was the evil robot you could have a gladdus voice
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:48.080]   And would you always give you the wrong directions?
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.120]   It would say turn left here when you're supposed to turn right
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:56.720]   Yeah, that was a dangerous voice assisted to use. That was great. That was so cool
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.120]   You know as we dive more into these virtual systems. I want these voices
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.480]   I want like cool unique voices because that would they'll probably make up for maybe some of the privacy we're giving up here
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.880]   Uh, I'm still waiting for my
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.720]   Is
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.240]   Candy and you'll hop in that van and go anywhere
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:20.240]   Absolutely, I don't know if you guys watch what we do in the shadows or the it crowd
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.320]   But uh, I want my matt berry gps voice because he has such a great
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.500]   Dramatic hilarious comedic voice and why I want you to give you that
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:34.160]   What I don't understand and I I don't I need to drive to to bat all the time
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.160]   I feel like I'm beating my head against the wall
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.960]   But why is it that we still have to say hey shlomo or hey gearmo?
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.440]   Why can't we say whatever we want we I did that four years ago in my modo x? Why is it right?
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:52.800]   Why do we can't we customize the trigger words? Wouldn't that go a long way to make these things better?
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.680]   But what would how would you want it?
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.960]   You know if you're talking rhetorically to yourself, you don't want it to be constantly answering either
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:06.320]   No, but that's why you make it something unusual what my on the modo x. It was help me. I'll be one kenobe
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.520]   Which was a phrase I was very unlikely to say in the other context
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.840]   I had to be careful when watching star wars episode very long phrase
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.800]   Yeah, but it was a and it was a nice thing was a long phrase now if that phone ages ago could do it
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:27.840]   I still don't understand why no one is doing that. Why can't we customize the trigger? Wouldn't that help with these false? Oh, you know
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.040]   wakes and all that stuff
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   Well, I think it plays into what
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.280]   What do vindra saying about like doing things locally versus doing things in the cloud?
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.920]   And I think it's the wider, you know
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:46.400]   There is a wider trend that we see you know even across like the camera things in these combinations of like better hardware
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.440]   and better software combined with computing in the crowd, you know the fact that
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.960]   Google can do all these you know always computational photography that layers things on top of each other
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:02.720]   You know you gotta imagine that they're doing similar level kind of sophistication stuff
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.280]   Has to be on devices
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.200]   Yeah, even the mo x must have been on device. It didn't have to send the trigger
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:15.760]   Phrase all the mo x had like uh, it had a low power processor that was kind of always on the background. It was always yeah
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that was a really unique
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.800]   Uh hardware setup basically no other phone had that google didn't really bring that over to other phones
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.160]   So, but you could I mean now all these devices are plugged in
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:30.400]   Uh, I mean maybe not my phone, but all the other devices are plugged in my
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:36.560]   I just don't understand it. My first thing more that I want a one-word trigger honestly like no, I don't think
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.920]   Yeah, no, I want it. I wanted to understand like it
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:42.960]   If it's a unique word
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:49.120]   Uh, like to me that would be more convenient and I also wanted to like pop up like we need more natural language
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:53.200]   Interactions so if I like look at something and it's like hey, can you do this?
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:59.120]   Um, I would like my phone to kind of understand that and we are getting like eye tracking and thinking that so we'll get there
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.760]   my google home hub nest max
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:07.840]   Uh thing when the alarm goes off in the morning. I don't have to say hey google. I just go stop
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.080]   And you get this it's very satisfying
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.640]   It's actually really great. It beats slamming your hand out on top of the you do the same thing by throwing against the wool
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:20.560]   Yeah, but yeah stop is great
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:24.960]   And it I don't have to say hey you or anything. I just it just for some reason it just knows
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.800]   It
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:34.400]   What would your word be though? Uh divindrif it was just you'd have to be a weird word you'd have to be like word rumple silksen platypus
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.680]   Yeah, yeah, or three syllables like I don't want to say two words
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.800]   Ko-fi-fi something that would be a good word that would never come up
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.520]   Ko-fi-fi. Yeah
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.960]   I think you want more syllables. I'm thinking
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.960]   It's more syllables is kind of a key at least three syllables
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:53.360]   But I just want something a little more natural like I've been following
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.280]   New at the nuance and dragon naturally speaking and all this tech for so long and that's another company
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:06.160]   They can do it, but they they've held a strangled hold on this technology because they've been super anti-competitive for so long
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:12.880]   So like there's there's a lot of stuff that we still are waiting to get a lot more natural language technology that needs to happen
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:17.680]   But we're getting there. It's gonna be exciting. I think like I just want to talk to my phone all right a few more stories
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.240]   Uh, but it's 420. So I have to do an ad
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:22.240]   um
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.240]   Great to have you will Harris. I don't know why it's been so long, but we will get you back here more
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.680]   I miss you guy
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:34.640]   CEO of a brand new company that will help podcasters and podcast listeners finally get it the way they want to entail
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.040]   anti-alea co
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.400]   Uh at will Harris 1l on the twitter. Do you tweet still?
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:43.600]   I do still tweet
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:45.920]   It's uh, I'm sure an old timer
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:51.280]   Yeah, there was there was a time I remember in 2007. I was one of the top
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:55.120]   Top 20 tweeters in the uk and that lasted for about a day
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.760]   I was number one in 2007
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:01.040]   I had I had 5 000 followers
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.040]   I was number one and that damn kevin rose he stopped answering emails and climbed up and beat me
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.400]   And then Ashton Kutcher came along the whole thing went to hell in a hand basket
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:15.280]   Georgia Dowd you tweet
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:22.080]   I almost never almost never now. No, it's it's um, it's relaxing
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:27.440]   I read but I you know sometimes I'll look at twitter and and then get unrelaxed
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:33.920]   So I yeah, so it's no fun. Georgia is a is actually a good person to talk to about this because she is
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.320]   uh, the author of anxiety
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.880]   Videos which are not to make you anxious but to help you handle anxiety
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:44.720]   And uh, that is at anxiety-videos.com
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:52.400]   Conflict resolution emotional intelligence how to sleep better how to parent better. It's all in here. These are great
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:57.920]   And I highly recommend them anxiety-videos.com. She does that near copious spirit time
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.160]   in between playing virtual reality games
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.800]   slashing around with beat saber and writing for i'm war.com
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:13.360]   And finally the vindra hard-of-war he is the senior editor and in gadget the senior gadget blog in the whole wide world
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:17.040]   And a senior yeah pretty senior you're right up there
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.960]   Looks like you're getting a little gray. Is that just an artifact of the lighter? Is there a little?
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.840]   Oh, no, I've been I mean I've been getting gray since I was a teenager, but it's definitely a little baby's
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:28.160]   Babies kind of accelerate all day will do that make
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.840]   presidency or babies either one makes you go gray
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.680]   Uh, diviner also is a host of the slash film podcast
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.480]   Oh slash film cast. Oh, there's it
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.960]   There's it
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.640]   That movie is so long so long. It's really it's like three hours. It's three hours. It's ridiculous
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.320]   Does not need to be three hours. We sent the kids the 16 year old to see it
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.640]   Lisa had to pretend she was going because it's an r-rated film. So she's a scough flaw
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.800]   Uh, she she went in and she went right out, but uh actually check that's oh, yeah
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.720]   They said you can't you kids you kids aren't uh aren't 18 you can't go in
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.000]   So uh she went in with them and then left because she didn't want to see it
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.320]   But explained because I haven't seen it
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.760]   The kids came home and started digging a trench in our backyard. Is there some scene where they dig a hole in the ground?
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.360]   It's a good sense. Yeah, they're good time. I don't know
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.520]   I don't now I have a trench in my backyard. They say yeah, we want to cover it with a tarplin
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.280]   What are they trying they're trying to trap clowns in my backyard? What are they doing?
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:32.160]   Man kids today. There's a very very bad backstory in there somewhere
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.200]   So it's a little weird. They they come in and say do you have any shovels?
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:48.240]   Gonna be I want to know what the neighbors thought shut. I need some shovels some duct tape rope and a couple of oven mitts you got those
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.800]   Okay, sure you're right over there
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.600]   Are surely
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.600]   You just keep it outside kids
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.920]   Kids today, I tell you
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.000]   At least they're not out in the streets getting in trouble, right?
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.840]   Right are sure they do you seven tape for that?
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:13.520]   What to do if your kids are digging digging ditches digging trenches in your backyard?
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.000]   Um
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.720]   Are sure they brought to you by wasabi you know when you have sushi you get that nice green
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:27.520]   Ball of hot wasabi. That's not what i'm talking about here. I'm talking about something hot this hot cloud storage wasabi
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.000]   Such a great idea. This is created as an alternative
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.480]   It's it's hot cloud storage. It blows away the competition including google including microsoft including amazon
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:45.600]   Created by my good friend David friend. He started carbonite. He's actually a serial entrepreneur goes way back armpic synthesizer and stuff
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.840]   And his cto jeff flowers
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:52.400]   They came up with a way back in the carbonite days to lay data on discs sequentially
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.280]   As opposed to in blocks. They have got the patent
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:03.120]   And as a result you get storage that's 80 percent cheaper and up to six times faster than amazon's s3
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:10.800]   Just because they're used it's at fifth the cost of s3 it uses amazon's api, but they don't charge for egress
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:16.000]   There's no hidden fees for api requests. You get 11 nines of durability
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.080]   You get
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:24.320]   data set and redundancy data integrity checking here's the thing i like the best and this is a real answer to the
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:28.880]   True ransomware crisis we're in right now. You get something called immutable storage
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:33.520]   You can at any time say that data that data there that can't be changed that can't be touched
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:39.040]   No ransomware can destroy it. No human error can erase it. That is immutable storage
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.800]   That makes it more secure than your on-premises storage
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.440]   It's amazing hip a compliant finry compliance ejis compliant
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.800]   I know if you're looking to go to the cloud and everybody is these days
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:55.760]   And I know I know you're already you've got the list. It's google microsoft amazon
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:59.600]   I know I know that I just want to add a fourth name just check it out
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:02.800]   Was sobby.com w as abi
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.880]   This is hot cloud storage
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:10.080]   And in order to compete with the big boys they've got to be better and they are lightning fast totally secure
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:16.880]   Completely affordable never any charge for egress or api requests. This is disruptive technology
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.080]   You got to try it. Look at all the companies that are starting to use wasabi
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.000]   I'm I feel really good about this because I've known david for years
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.640]   He's when he's when he launched this company. We talked he said this I just I believe in this
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:32.000]   We got to get the word out and i'm glad to help was sobby.com

[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:59.760]   Was sobby.com. Thank you was sobby for your support
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:02.320]   So we don't know when the google event will be
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:07.920]   We do know there will be a microsoft event. They've announced uh october second just a few weeks off
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.840]   And it'll probably a surface event right devenger
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:18.160]   Yeah, most likely this is I think last year october second was the last same exact day. Yeah, I think so
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.960]   Yeah, and uh, they typically have a surface event every year now
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:27.200]   What's interesting is that they're always pretty low key like a microsoft doesn't run like they don't have a stage presentation
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.840]   Last year they didn't even live stream it. It was just like a short you know a small thing for press
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:38.080]   This year it's gonna be live streamed. Um, I think you know, I think we're gonna see some really interesting things here too
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.760]   We are waiting for some like surface laptop updates some surface book updates and it sounds like
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:45.120]   Um
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.920]   They're hinting at new experiences and i'm thinking
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.280]   Given how everything is going this year i'm thinking we may see something dual screen
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.480]   And that would be kind of fun. They have been rumors haven't there. Yeah, and there is a screen tablet like a courier thing
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:02.720]   Yeah, there's even code in windows that would encourage us to think this
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.760]   Um
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:10.080]   So we will stream it will cover it live october second sat in new york city because they're streaming it
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:16.000]   We can do our you know our traditional mystery science theater 3000 coverage of it. We sit in front of the screen and
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.400]   I love those by the way. I I much rather
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.640]   Um watch those
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.240]   Yeah, it's okay
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.640]   So really the best way to watch anything like an apple event or a microsoft event is with friends
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.920]   Like in a big group like watch it work or with friends other people would care because it's so much fun to throw
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.880]   Spitballs and and mock it and just to talk about it and then get excited when it's excited cheer when it's something to cheer
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:44.000]   So for those of you who can't watch it in a group like that watch it with us. We're what we're a group
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.240]   We'll we'll all watch it. I will say for people who don't pay attention to microsoft hardware anymore
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.920]   I am far more excited by microsoft hardware these days and apples hard
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:58.640]   Like it's just on especially when it comes to pcs like they're making some of the best laptops around they're consistently great
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.480]   They have keyboards with travel and they feel amazing like I I'm just so impressed with what they've been doing
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.360]   They're the underdog
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:10.320]   They have to you know rise to the occasion and do something to wow us to get some press
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:11.200]   I'm all good
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.080]   That competition makes it yeah much more fun
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.960]   I have to say I had the surface studio here for a long time and I've switched over to a linovial
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.800]   Nolovo all in one that does the same thing. It's got the shallow angle
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.360]   It has a knob but the knob is a usb knob that plugs in like that
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.840]   And I can it doesn't have the dial
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.280]   Well, it is like a dial though because I can program it to do different things
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.560]   This is the mute button. I mean you it's programmable in fact
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:40.000]   It will sense different apps you can't really see because of the wire
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.480]   It'll sense different apps the color will change if i'm running photoshop and it'll have different you can have different
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.480]   Tasks to sign the other thing I really like about this it also comes with a pencil
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:54.080]   It's half the cost of the surface with a much faster processor 32 gigs of ram and
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:58.400]   This pad right here. You can't see it but behind it screen is a Qi charger
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.440]   So I could put my phone on it and charges
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.800]   I know that's that doesn't go fully flat leo it goes
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:10.720]   Almost as flat as a surface studio not completely, but you know you want it's like a drafting table
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.040]   I think it's 20 degrees not 15
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.760]   But for half the cost 27 inches also at 16 9 not 3 by 2
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.200]   What do you think of 3 by 2?
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:23.680]   Microsoft really likes that 3 by 2 aspect ratio. I think for laptops. It's kind of nice
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:30.320]   I like having a little more vertical space like I can I can see more in a web browser 16 by 9 is so limiting
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.160]   And I think we've just all kind of gotten used to it
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.280]   But it was because of tv right i mean more that was the reason so you could watch movies and that kind of thing
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:39.520]   And also people I think they were just making those panels
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.800]   So everybody was making 16 by 9 panels and it's kind of what we've stuck with
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:46.960]   I like 16 by 10 which is widescreen, but a little bit a little bit more
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.520]   Um, we've seen that in some surfaces too
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.480]   So it's expected there'll be at least a surface laptop update maybe a surface tablet
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:57.360]   Yeah, we're waiting for a new surface pros
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:03.040]   I wouldn't be surprised if we see like another surface arm thing just because it's basically been the flagship
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.040]   Windows arm device and it started out terribly and it's gotten better
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:11.840]   So i'm interested to see what happens there. Yeah for sure. I'm also really
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.880]   I feel like the fact that they're streaming it implies there's something as you say there's something interesting
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:21.760]   They want people to see something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise you don't stream if it's just a head. We got new surface
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.640]   Basically yeah, yeah
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.440]   But will it come in corpse burple
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.760]   I
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:37.040]   I bought the surface laptop that came with alcantara on it. Oh, yeah, it was the fuzzy. Yeah, fuzzy keyboard. How'd that hold up
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.760]   Did it get dirty?
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:45.840]   When you eat Doritos, did it change colors? Yes, do not okay, so this is absolutely true
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.920]   No cheetos no Doritos because it will
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.920]   The cheese leave will adhere to the alcantara
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:59.440]   It's not a good look. It feels good though. It feels nice. It's nice to have that wrist rest be a little kind of swady
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:02.240]   Thing that's great. I mean we're saying
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:07.680]   I don't think the wrist rest is the reason not to eat cheetos and
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:14.400]   What do you mean? What are you trying to say? It's a great american food
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.200]   um
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.880]   Somebody in the chat room Rodney said
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:27.840]   Okay, october 2nd, but don't forget the bill gates documentary comes out september 20th friday
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:32.240]   Oh, yeah, this is the netflix. Uh now I think gates was heavily involved
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:37.120]   So I doubt there'll be a lot of like Epstein stuff in there. This is gonna be very fluffy
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:44.320]   It's gonna be it's gonna be uh as the as the ox 40 and what do you call that oxonian might say it's a heat
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.000]   Geography
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.120]   Right, right. It'll be yeah. I wonder if they'll have to do a second version of it to include the internet
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:57.440]   That is deep deep inside deep inside
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:02.720]   Uh, let's see. There's a couple other stories. Uh, I wanted to mention
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:06.000]   Microsoft's Minecraft
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:11.520]   Has kept get this 112 million monthly active users
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:20.080]   That is amazing. I love it. I people love it. Mm-hmm. My kids now are playing uh,
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.360]   VR Minecraft apparently there's a there's a hookup
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.680]   That you can with the uh with the uh, is it with the vive or with the quest?
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.840]   I can't remember which but they're playing it in vr
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:34.720]   And what's neat is they had built a job. We have i'm running a bunch of minecraft servers at home
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:40.800]   And they had built like this giant city. It's it's like it's got a sewer system. It's got a lighting system
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.440]   It's like it's got a subway. It's bigger than new york. It's huge. It's got hospitals
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:52.400]   There's helicopters is a medivac helica and all of a sudden this thing that they built in a 2d environment they can walk into it
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:07:00.320]   Mine glowing that's very very cool. And it's just great. I love how creative mine like you can really it's your imagination
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:05.600]   That is your limit and there's some amazing like really really cool things that people have built like
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.600]   Yeah, I can't i'm sure when they launched the
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:15.120]   Arversion to yeah, basically when they launch uh minecraft earth the the ar
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.480]   Where is that they advertised that months ago? Where the hell is that they said it was coming?
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.760]   They were gonna beta test in the summer and maybe that happened, but yeah, it has been made of testing elsewhere
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:30.400]   Not in the us where in Romania where I can't remember the countries, but I think one of them was new zeland
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:35.360]   Oh, several several countries. They test everything in new zeland first for some reason
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:42.080]   So I did the demo for that like before the build conference. It's it's amazing. It is fantastic like what they are able to do
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:46.560]   Um, I can't wait. It's it's definitely gonna be the next pokemon go basically
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.040]   and finally
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.600]   Movie pass calls it quits
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:08:01.520]   You know if you were smart enough to get a movie pass and use it like crazy
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:06.720]   You helped burn that hundred million dollars and in in funding
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:09.840]   Uh
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:12.480]   I it's amazing that they were able to raise money on a
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:16.480]   A business model that just didn't seem to have any way to make money. Nope
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.160]   Not at all
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.840]   You talking about how you were like unsure how they could ever make money from this when it first came out
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.200]   But I was too stupid to get one
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.240]   You didn't get one because the the thing is if if somebody wants to burn money
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:38.080]   Well, you take advantage of help them our old editor josh josh loved his movie
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:41.040]   His movie pass he spent so much of their money
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:44.400]   He was he was going to like a movie a day
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.920]   Wow, so really this is why movie pass went out of businesses because of josh
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.880]   It was him. Yeah, it was all it was pretty much all josh windish
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.360]   So for $10 a month you could see a movie every single day. They raised
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.320]   a big
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.320]   box
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.160]   But it just didn't have any way to make money
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:09.040]   It's uh, so here's the thing movie pass
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.880]   I think launched in like 2012 and they went through a lot of different
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.120]   It was expensive when they first started it was 40
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.200]   It was like 40 to 50 bucks
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:21.120]   And then before the card came out the card was like their little tech invasion
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.640]   Because before movie pass there wasn't a way to like remotely
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.920]   Add funds to debit card or something like they they had figured something out that was kind of cool
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.800]   But before you would have to like print out a sheet and bring it to the theater and like get them the scanner
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.360]   The theaters might turn it down two theaters hated the theaters rebelled against all of this
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:42.080]   Like the theaters didn't want them like it was a big big fight
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:46.320]   And when the $10 pricing happened, uh, I talked to the new ceo
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:49.440]   I think his name was michlou and he was a guy who came out of red box
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.680]   He was the guy who was like red box one dollar a night. He seemed like a smart guy
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.680]   He seemed like he had a plan
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:00.880]   And that's his plan is basically super low pricing to encourage as much growth as possible and that worked
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.000]   But they didn't have the rest of the plan figured out
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.800]   So like when millions of people actually signed up
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:10.800]   They didn't they didn't know how to like actually keep buying these tickets
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:14.320]   And then they had to like start uh canceling tickets from major
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:17.920]   Screenings like major movies like they just wouldn't list it in the app
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.840]   And it just got so shady and so messy as a customer experience
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:27.200]   Like I called this company dead a year ago because it felt dead like there there was nothing really going on here
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:33.440]   But the very least we got um all the cinema chains kind of paying attention to this and launching their own subscription services
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:35.760]   So I i'm a big fan of emc
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.120]   A list if you live near an emc theater, it's a good way to do it, but you have to be near an emc theater
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.720]   Yeah, you have to be near an emc
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:47.440]   In the or vposs will will be the the native cinema pauses, right?
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:50.720]   We have that because they can't be that that's not like to do you know
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.520]   So when just make some sense when michloh took over they had 20 000 subscribers
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.520]   He was really good at hyper growth got them too
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:00.480]   Three million subscribers by a year ago
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.000]   Five percent of all the movie tickets sold in the us were purchased through movie pass and they were losing
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.640]   $21 million a month
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:11.840]   Do they pay theaters the full freight is that?
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.720]   Yeah, they paid the full price like that's how it was
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:19.840]   I think they got bought by a private equity company and that's the problem like once that happens
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:25.920]   They want they want a multiple, you know, they want to sell this company for multiples of what it's worth or something
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:29.600]   And they weren't getting enough funding to kind of keep it all going so
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:34.240]   Too successful too quickly, I guess at the final stage. That was their big problem
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.640]   Yeah, they didn't think of step two when they have all of those subscribers. What do they now do?
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:43.120]   Right. That's that that's that profit. I think low. I think low do have a plan. Yeah, yeah
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:49.440]   Of marketing and yes, this is the he's a marketing guy like he knew the market he had the marketing down
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:51.840]   They didn't have the logistics down. They didn't have like
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:57.040]   Basically a parent company that would actually support them to grow like if they got
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:02.000]   If they got a decent amount of funding in to keep it going. I think if this was like five years ago
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.680]   Maybe in the dot com bubble was like a bit hotter
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.160]   Like they probably would have been able to like fight through it like uber
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:13.680]   How much money is uber losing? You know uber as a company who knows if they'll ever be profitable
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:18.960]   But they're still going because they got all this early vc money and everybody just wants them to succeed basically
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.560]   Yeah
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:26.560]   Folks, I think it's time to wrap this guy up for the week. Hey, really really fun to have you all here
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.480]   Of divindra hard of war
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.800]   Where is slash film? How can somebody listen to this great podcast? If you go to slash film dot com
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:37.280]   There's a there's a link up top to the slash film cast or if you go to slash film cast
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:40.160]   Dot com you'll go straight to the itunes page subscribe
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:43.520]   Uh, it's you know, it's a good show. We have a lot of fun
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.720]   And i'm looking forward to talking about ad astra that new uh, the brand new brad hit movie
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:53.120]   Would you have you seen i hear really good things? I've seen it next week, but i've heard good things
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:58.480]   I'm also going to be talking about undone that new uh, rotoscoped animation show on amazon
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:04.960]   It is incredible. So my the one takeaway from everything i'm saying tonight go watch undone. It's up now
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:07.280]   It's an amazing show
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.640]   It's on amazon prime. It's from the bojack horseman creator and one of the writers from bojack
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:17.680]   And it's so it's so good. It's just great science fiction rooted in a really great personal story
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.480]   rotoscope is kind of neat that's like waking life where they take actually film the
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:26.080]   The motion but then they draw over each frame individually
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.840]   So it's animated so this is rotoscoping and like 3d sets and stuff too. So i wrote a bit about this and gadget
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.360]   Um, it just looks incredible. It makes it makes me
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:40.560]   Hope we see more rotoscoped projects in the future because it's a really useful technique for a show like this
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:43.600]   Oh, this is gonna be good. I'll watch it tonight. Thank you great tip
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.480]   Georgia dau. What are you playing on your?
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:49.200]   VR
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.960]   Falcon falcon falcon story. I think falcon story falcon age anyways. Yes
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:55.760]   You play as
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.200]   Yeah, you're a falconer. You have your falcon which I totally want to do in real life is become a falconer
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:06.160]   And so get your falcon you send it off you get to gather things. It's got a little bit of uh, you know
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:12.000]   You plant food and take care of your falcon. It's it's really fun. It's cute
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:18.400]   I've been waiting for it. It does it does a good job. There's a few it's a little bit glitchy in some areas
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:25.360]   Um, but it's really wonderful and i'm having a lot of fun playing it. I have the graphics are stunning
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:31.360]   I love the idea that so do you have it hunt? What do you what do you have it do? Yes, you and it's very
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:36.640]   Intuitive so you whistle you put your hands just to your mouth and your falcon will come to you
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.200]   And if you point to what on one hand it's sending, you know, it's your falcon hand
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:44.240]   You point to something the falcon will go and attack or bring it to you
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:49.520]   And so it's it's really cute and you get fist bump the falcon
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:55.920]   Oh, you can give it a beard. It's like the cutest thing ever and when you touch the falcon and pet it
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.760]   You actually feel a little bit of a rumble on your controllers. So
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.040]   I like seeing this because this is innovative
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:07.120]   This is not just trying to take a first-person shooter and put it in vr
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.000]   Now it's something it's just different and that interaction that you have with your falcon
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.880]   It feels very real you get very attached to the the falcon the storyline is good
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:25.600]   Not fabulous or great, but it's pretty good and the um conversations and discussions that you have with people there are
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.360]   It's okay. So the falcon it sounds like real life
