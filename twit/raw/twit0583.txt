[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.800]   News and I am thrilled to have my good buddy Ian Thompson from the register dot co dot uk
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.240]   Year was good there always good always a pleasure Ian will be back Saturday - I think to do this yes
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   We're doing you screens have us together and
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.960]   But bad news and I'm was worried that maybe you wouldn't come back after you learned at the British shop in Petaluma has closed
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   It's closed. Oh
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.440]   I'm never coming back. Damn it. Why am I gonna get my twixes from now?
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.480]   I'm gonna get my my folks my pj tips. They did great pasties there as well
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.280]   That's just wrong, you know past means something different in the UK than it does in the United States
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.760]   You just want to let you know for a savory meat pie then a savory meat pie that I understand so what a pasties over here
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.240]   Probably don't want to say also with us
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   This is the all international edition today from Montreal and I'm more calm our good friend Renee Richie a regular
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.840]   on Mac break weekly hi Renee I live welcome back I
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.160]   Even though I was all over the world Russia and
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.560]   Finland and the Netherlands I was reading I'm or the whole time because I had with me an iPhone 7
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.760]   And I had to learn how to use it the thing
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   There's there's a lot of changes and then I got the new watch OS and the new Apple watch and then I'm back to I'm more to figure out
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.680]   How do you how what band to get because you're the king of bands? Yeah?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.040]   The band they ship by the way with this most expensive Apple watch now the yes is the worst band ever
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.360]   It's a dirty gray rubber band
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   Yeah, I would really like a ceramic white band to go like I'm figuring the price would double to make that band
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   But I would still like that option even if we're just the same color as the watch white, but it's dirty gray
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.960]   Anyway, that's a that's a first-world problem. I think that's the ultimate first world problem
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.160]   You know this watch was thirteen hundred dollars, but the band is just rubber
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.560]   Yeah, it's not it's a non combustible Apple product though. You also you're Steve. Do you feel true floral last summer does not burn?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.960]   Steve. Oh, I don't know
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:21.760]   Well, what does burn apparently is the note seven even and this is terrifying the replacement note sevens now I really want to emphasize
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.520]   The the invest with there. I want to know more
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.200]   I because maybe this isn't an official replacement. This is the first one
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.960]   We heard about a fire on the southwest plane and wasn't plugged in it was in a guy's pocket started to heat up
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.360]   He pulled it out through it on the floor burst into flames burning the carpet of the plane and the sub flooring forcing the evacuation
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.840]   Fortunately the plane was at the gate everybody got off right now the fire department has that phone
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.200]   But Samsung says we want it and the consumer product safety Commission says we want it, but that's not the last story
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.600]   There but two more's reported for us Jerry right be right before the show so Jerry Hilderman from
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.800]   Android Central has been following it all weekend and there have been five in the US now and four in Asia
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.900]   Yeah, it's two of them just in the last one. He said as always writing one story two more happened
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.360]   How which is where we are right now at this point?
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.640]   You got to think maybe these are the replacement phones
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.160]   Well, okay, I've sponed Samsung of spon to the consumer protection people neither of them have had the phones in their hand
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   So the champion moment but it's looking increasingly likely as though they rushed out the replacement
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.040]   They didn't think this one through properly and they're in a whole world of hurt from a branding here's a conspiracy theory
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.160]   They rushed it out. They got it out within a week right? They started shipping 20 on the 21st of September and
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.320]   I talked to somebody today on the radio show who had a replacement phone and
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.040]   His theory and I think it may not be far off
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.400]   He says you know this phone doesn't hold a charge very well. I think they changed the firmware
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   but did not
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.120]   retool the phone and of course
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.800]   That maybe makes sense to do it that quickly
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.880]   They'd have that phone is not is it just like the iPhone is a sealed phone?
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.840]   You'd have to take out the entire battery, but it probably also the charging assembly
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.360]   I don't know if they could get replacement phones in that quantity out within a week
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   Maybe all they did was change the firmware
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.380]   Yeah, there's something deeply fishy going on about this because I mean it was there for the taking Apple was going to
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.660]   Get a lot of flack with the iPhone 7 coming out dropping the audio jack not really doing that much else to it
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.300]   The market was theirs for them
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.820]   And I think they're just like we've got to get this out now
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.700]   So it's yeah, we can get win over disgruntled Apple users and they seem to have screwed the pooch on quite the opposite now
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.980]   I think a lot of people took their refund on the note 7 and bought iPhone 7s and
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.780]   Willful them but anybody who took a replacement phone by the way all the US carriers and I would imagine this is true worldwide
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.700]   Are saying fine bring the interest replacement phone back will we'll get we'll make it a hole you hole
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.020]   If it give you a fun or AT&T won't even give you replacement note 7 anymore. They just pull the plug
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.580]   Yeah, yeah as I would expect and at this point how bad is this for Samsung Renee?
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.900]   So there's a couple things to pull apart here one is that
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.100]   We don't know very much about this like Samsung owns 20% of the battery company that made this thing is Samsung SDI
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.780]   But batteries are very complicated lithium-ion batteries, especially are very complicated beast and there were stories about maybe the
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.180]   Positive and negative polarity weren't properly separated and that was causing an unusual amount
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.280]   There's always some failures always some critical failures like you see every phone on iPhones have occasionally burnt
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.700]   LG for almost any phone you can go find a few incidents of this happening to you
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.860]   But this was happening with alarming regularity
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.060]   Which made them think that maybe the chemistry was wrong and there were rumors of course that they did rush it to market to try
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:47.460]   Beat Apple to the punch here, but it's also possible that what they thought was wrong is not what was in fact wrong with the battery and whether it was firmware
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.780]   Or they switched supplies because apparently slip supplies from the other companies that they were pulling from weren't having these incidents
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.260]   But it just could be that they fail to identify the proper problem or the problem was much deeper than what they thought there would
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.620]   Would it be because those replacement phones did come to market really really really fast?
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.200]   And now I mean yeah, Samsung hasn't said anything the fiber hasn't anything but the verge has done a great job
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.080]   They've gotten photos of the boxes. They've they've checked the number of sounds on those
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.720]   Surge phones are accurate those very photos are accurate and I think I see no reason not to think so these were the official replacements
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.020]   multiple times yeah
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.020]   Three or four of them at least they've identified and one of them a Samsung person accidentally texted the owner of the phone
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.940]   Yes, what do you want me to do try to suppress this and it sounds like in Korea
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.820]   There's charges of them trying to suppress it in the media as well and that it's never the story
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.620]   It's always the I mean it's never the crime is always the cover up and that is potentially
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.220]   I think even more explosive than the actual phone incidents. Yeah, I saw that I saw that text message and it was just like
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:51.940]   Wow, this is gonna make this so much worse because if they're actually talking about this and they've managed to let on
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.180]   They're talking about it in these terms. That's it
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:01.100]   You know, they're gonna have to a complete product recall and redesign the phone because you know people just aren't gonna trust the brand after this
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.540]   the note seven in question here was owned by a
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.460]   fellow from Kentucky
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.620]   It on Tuesday. It not only caught fire, but sent him to the hospital with smoke inhalation
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.580]   And Samsung knew about this and didn't say anything about this
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.540]   They asked him if they could take possession of the phone. He said no
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:29.620]   Though the company did pay to have it x-rayed but according to the verge the damning evidence comes in the form of a text message
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.100]   That he received accidentally from a Samsung representative quote just now got this
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.700]   I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.900]   So I think
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.220]   It's a smoking gun
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.660]   They clearly knew about it and we're but they knew what the damage would be
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.540]   I mean, this is it for the note seven right that phone is now dead
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:03.140]   Yeah, I mean people are for capricious and we've seen many examples of where you know like people like us will just say never again
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.940]   Like I've done that with companies that have installed root kits or other forms of malware on their own machines and sold them to me
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.380]   But other people go by the next version. You immediately there
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.980]   Go on it's not fully rational though because really statistically
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.940]   Even if you had the original note seven it was one in
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.980]   30,000 that you might get a burn the consumer behavior is never rational. Yeah, I mean well and who wants to take the chance
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.980]   It's just a phone. I'm not gonna take the chance
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.900]   A little girl was one of the people playing with one of them and that's something you never ever want to have happen, right?
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:42.260]   And you know a few people are asking me and all I could say is well why take the chance get rid of your note seven
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.260]   Yeah, yeah, but here's the bigger problem. Do you then say should I get a galaxy S7?
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.740]   No, hang around and get a note five if you really want if you really want a stylist get a note five if you really want a Samsung
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.940]   Get a galaxy S7 if you really want an Android phone get a pixel if you really feel okay about that you shouldn't worry
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:05.820]   No, no, I don't think so we've had phones and lithium ion batteries for years and even though some small number
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:16.780]   Battery gets punctured, but this is the same but the Tesla's had this problem too with but I mean
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:22.140]   Renee's got a point you can't use lithium ion batteries on a mass market product without once or twice
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.220]   Them going nuts all it takes is a tiny sliver of metal within the other the actual battery itself
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.820]   Breaking loose shorting across and then instant fire. It's an essentially, you know
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:38.100]   It's a very safe technology, but when it goes it goes boom and you know it can be quite dangerous in that regard
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.620]   Yeah, but the note seven is beyond the statistical norm is beyond the norm
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.980]   I think oh yeah, people need safety. So yeah, you need to take it back
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:52.580]   Wow I oh by the way Jeff Jarvis is about to join us as well
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.180]   Awesome, so we just we went crazy when we when we said oh we lost Ben Thompson
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.140]   We said just call everybody you know you need at least four or five steps thrilled
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.700]   I think this is this is a lot of fun. We'll get Ben again another time. He probably either forgot or
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.900]   As has happened once before his internet might have gone out and then he's gonna
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:17.860]   So kudos to Jordan Golsen for doing a heck of a job reporting. Absolutely. You've been on at all weekend. Yeah, absolutely
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.060]   Well, it's a big story. It's a big story for all consumers
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.620]   I know when I get calls about something I got a lot of them on the radio show that people are aware of it
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:32.940]   And and I think that it will have a long-term damaging effect on Samsung. Yeah, adjust the time when it doesn't need a bad reputation
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.460]   Well, by the way, I have a Samsung dishwasher
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.180]   clothes washer
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.460]   And apparently there's a problem there too don't put on the extra halt setting you know
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.500]   And they were accused of again like that like bad things will always happen like any this could happen to any manufacturer
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.660]   But with the grace of God it happens to anybody because like it's this technology
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.860]   But it's how you handle it that really matters and how you deal with consumers
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.740]   And then we all we've gone back to that tile
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.060]   I'll instant repeatedly where they could have just pulled those VAT numbers and tried, you know play the odds
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.740]   but they pulled everything because they knew their brand was more important and
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:10.700]   There's there's concerns over how Samsung was trying to cover up potentially cover up evidence for the washing machines, too
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.060]   And that that's the part that's gonna hurt
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.700]   I mean Samsung needs to as a company get in front of this and do everything it can to make sure that their customers feel that they're protected
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.700]   And it's not Samsung protecting themselves because that's the part that always hurts a company. Yeah
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.220]   I mean Samsung certainly worst PR week Yahoo a very close second. Oh, we're gonna get to that in a moment
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.500]   Let me introduce Jeff Jarvis though. He's just joining us
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.860]   Professor of journalism at the City University of New York. Sorry you got me on pizza night
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:41.300]   That looks like wine Jeff. I hate to tell you that ain't pizza. The pizza's on the wine is still there
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.540]   You also you have to live with my Hillary Schwag. I knew you'd be wearing your hoodie because
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:54.660]   You bought it and then hadn't in August and Hillary stickers and yeah, I'm back from Bethlehem PA having
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.500]   registered voters today
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.340]   So well and I think you probably will want us. I don't know maybe not to be done by the time the debate starts
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.700]   Well, it's not a clock you bloody well better be done by that. Oh
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:11.300]   You don't know how long twit goes do you? Oh, I do I do but that's two and a half hours from now
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.820]   I gotta be I gotta be on Twitter for that event absolutely
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.940]   So on Samsung, you know, I actually feel sympathy for Samsung because they finally got their act together
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.700]   They find a good products. They finally figured out they finally stopped with all the worst the junk where they finally did it all and
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.460]   Then you know the sex tape came out. Yeah, it is Samsung sex tape
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.860]   If they behave differently again with the reaction was different
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.660]   It's hard to have sympathy given reports in both the US and and Korea that they're not doing the right
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.820]   The real question means clear that you're nobody's gonna buy a note seven they're ever again
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:15:00.660]   Business though, I mean, that's the real question is that's that'd be a shame. Oh, no, they're too big wide. Yeah
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:07.420]   You know and I I know you've already talked about this the Google event was this week. I'm
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:14.220]   Rapidly coming to the point where I think instead of having five phones four Android phones and one iPhone
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.900]   I will be down to two phones a Google phone and an Apple phone and that will be that and I'm wondering if that isn't the future going forward
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.260]   Certainly Google with its announcement of the pixel
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:30.380]   its price point and the fact that the pixel has features no other Android device has
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:37.660]   Kind of sounds to me like Google's going after the other handset manufacturers. Okay, but Leo Leo here's here's my question about the pixel and
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   And as usual I'm neurotic so I need to talk me through this because I've ordered it and I might cancel it
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.820]   I don't know I'm gonna be neurotic. I'm from New York. I'm allowed to be
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.900]   The whole notion that AI is available only on this phone
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.820]   Makes no sense to me because the AI occurs up in the cloud up in the big big big machine somewhere off in Google land
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.580]   Well, and it's the same apparently AI is in aloe
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:04.260]   So if you put the aloe messenger on your apple phone or your yeah, I tried that this week. I tried to ask yeah
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260]   We were allowing back and forth. I was in Paris and we were allowing
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.700]   I'll use aloe with with Google assistant this week and it doesn't work so well
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.620]   So I understand I want to have aloe available at a crack with the phone
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.180]   But what I'm saying is I think that Google just pulled a marketing trick and put
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.540]   Assistant into the new phone because it's a marketing thing
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.900]   It's not because there's any hardware reason that it should be there or not elsewhere, right?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.500]   There may be is an argument that they don't want to go wide right away that they want to slowly and they say this happens roll
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.620]   It out you see this is why I'm kind of skeptical about the whole whole sort of Google is going after Samsung with this because they don't have the
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   Infrastructure in place to do the kind of long-term large infrastructure
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.220]   So a lot large sales and have the infrastructure
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:54.740]   So they're really good point. They're not going to be going up against Samsung directly is gonna be selling the pixel
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.700]   They're gonna sell it in their stores. Yeah, I mean Verizon's a very small player outside of the you know
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:05.620]   I mean it's a pure US sell everyone else it's all down to sim cards and Verizon is a
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.260]   Historical or technological economy it really has no further place than in the tech sphere
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.660]   But if Google are actually serious about taking on Samsung
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.260]   There's a whole bunch of other stuff they need rather than just we've got this shiny new phone
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.340]   And Samsung's AI Bayer AI buy a big
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:29.420]   Viv yeah, the folks who did Siri sold it to Apple. Yeah have created a new AI Viv.ai and
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:37.220]   Just sold to Samsung, but that's you know everybody has to Microsoft's got Cortana Google's got assistant
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:43.180]   Apples got Siri you got if you're gonna be a player you Amazon's got to echo and if you're gonna be player you better
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:48.140]   Have you want to be a platform you have to have a virtual assistant Samsung so far has been Android license
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.600]   They've been flirting with being their own platform for a long time with their own store with their own very
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.840]   high systems with time with
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.080]   I was in and bought on before ties in
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:03.980]   What did you think of that notion of going from from mobile first to AI first who was that I like that?
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.120]   No, let's take it. Yeah, let's take a break in it because I want to I want to
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.860]   Be timely in our commercials so we can get you out in time for the debate
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:17.020]   But but and I also want to spend some time on this Google announcement because there was a lot to unpick an old
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   Um, great great panel today. Jeff Jarvis. Just joining us. I am honored as ever to be here
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.100]   Oh, we love having you on from this week in Google and I missed you over the last couple of weeks
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.100]   I missed you
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.300]   but I followed along your your hoodie drama and
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:40.980]   And I'm glad to see you and talk to you look at that what why would a campaign
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.220]   for a president sell a hoodie a
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.480]   Sol and is really cool and out a hoodie. I know this does have a rather a monk look doesn't it? Yeah
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:19:00.500]   Yeah, also with us from the register code UK. Oh, it's hoodie time
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   Solidarity I'm sorry my
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:12.780]   Britt walk into a room. Well being well from from Brexit land. Yeah from yeah, okay rub it in rub it in
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.440]   Yeah, well, we got plenty of rub in here. You've got another
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.900]   Exit I mean you got everything you've got another 31 days to call us stupid about that vote and then when president Trump comes in
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.020]   boots on the other foot may see
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   mighty
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.320]   And then also first from Montreal it's the international episode
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.520]   There's the only guy there's the only guy who could smugly look at the rest of us thinking
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:42.320]   Only for the moment we've had our dark days - by the way, I've been getting calls ever since the pre-show from
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.660]   Danish listeners it was Belgium that didn't have a had a
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.340]   constant oh a
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.980]   Crisis a parliamentary crisis it was for 300 some days on the green had no president
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.340]   But now they do and the country ran perfectly well
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.940]   Israel almost every year, right? There's a message there
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.540]   I was in Belgium. It was running well chocolate in the beer was
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.860]   Faffles chocolate here. Yeah, really
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.060]   Did you have any hairy Leo?
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:16.700]   No, I avoided the hearing like oh you missed it you wasted it. I did it was a stock
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.660]   Well, we had no hearing I was only briefly in Stockholm. I didn't get to storehouse long enough
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.420]   But yeah, I could have had hearing but no I chose otherwise
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.220]   Some she didn't have that fermented shark stuff
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.220]   Which just the smell of it is you know
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.340]   They don't even allow that on aircraft in Sweden anymore because it's just if it's in breaks
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.340]   They've got a steam clean the entire
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.980]   So he's turn off. Yeah, it's a serious
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.380]   Fearing
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.940]   Shark
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.020]   The plane Leo and they made that announcement and no someone behind me had someone behind me said oh what's going wrong
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.260]   And then the sky said oh it'll burn down your house and everyone in the cabin started freaking out
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.020]   And they took like five minutes to try to calm everybody down before takeoff
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.540]   What's still unclear though is if I mean these phones are clearly burning even if they're not charging
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:10.140]   It's not clear that they're not burning if they're not on I think that if it's burning when it's just sitting in your pocket
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.660]   Doesn't matter if it's on or off right that's got to kill somebody in a house or a car. Yeah, it's really good
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.500]   And also as a part I know for a number of pilots their biggest fear isn't crashing per se
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.860]   It's a fire on an on a cross Atlantic or cross-Pacific flight
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.460]   Yes, if that happens you've just got to get the plane down as fast as possible
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.980]   And there has never been a recorded instance of an aircraft landing in the sea and coming out of him one big
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.780]   No, thanks for jollying up this
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.220]   Hey, there's never going home. Are you I used to cover aviation? I'd say and I swear I could tell you
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.900]   Yeah, that's interesting. We'll have to get into that
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.540]   But first a word from carbonite our sponsor this hour
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:54.480]   Carbonite online backup protects your files on your servers on your system
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.180]   It's automatic cloud backup and it is a boon for anybody in business
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:06.620]   Your data in business is your business, you know your customer list your suppliers your accounts receivable
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.160]   And so a good backup is vital. How many times have we seen now?
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.940]   ransomware by hospitals police departments businesses and it is
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.820]   Devasting that what was that hospital in LA that was out of it couldn't handle patients for like three weeks?
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.580]   If they'd had carbonite it had been over in three minutes
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:34.060]   Carbonite online backup does versioning that means if you're running windows you turn on versioning even if you get bit by ransomware
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:40.040]   Even if you get your encrypted files backed up you could still go back to the pre-encrypted
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:47.460]   Version you're never at risk a good backup is the best solution for all kinds of horrific
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.820]   occurrences from hurricanes to ransomware
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.460]   Few things are as bad for businesses downtime, so don't take the risk carbonites backed up half
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.880]   a trillion files and
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.780]   Counting more than a million and a half homes and small businesses use carbonite and right now
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.540]   It's free free free to try no credit card needed just go to carbonite calm
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.100]   But do use the offer code twit
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:17.620]   Because if you do decide to buy you'll get two months free with your purchase for home for office for Mac or for PC
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.940]   You got to back it up to get it back do it right?
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.180]   with carbonite
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.500]   This weekend tech I'm so glad to be back
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.940]   After about 10 days away, I started holding little roundtable panel discussion
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.860]   I was gonna say poor Lisa because you probably started hosting just
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.300]   Lisa
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:46.780]   It's it's it's really an addiction the tech news and
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.420]   When you're at sea, you know, it's hard to get in the internet what it's what what what news while you were gone make you most safe
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   Oh, I wish I could talk
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.260]   Oh, that's interesting. That's a good question
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.620]   Elon Musk
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.540]   What happened with Elon Musk and oh you just what do you hear when he detailed his Martian excursion plans?
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.860]   No, there was I was at sea. I missed that what are you so he's taking us to Mars now?
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.540]   Is that the old beyond is evacuating a world? He does not believe is real. This is correct. Oh, this whole thing about the
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.540]   simulation
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.220]   Yeah, I would think it's easier to hack it at this point. Don't make a rocket just hack the coast of the space experts
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.620]   I know say it is much harder to live on Mars than you think a lot harder to live on
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.820]   Mars than on Earth even in the worst scenario of climate change
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.600]   But even the Winnipeg it is harder to live on Mars than it's hard to live on Mars and Winnipeg that tells you something
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.660]   Yeah, but at the same time that's not entirely the point because I think one of the things he's worried about is that
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:50.140]   We are one giant space rock away from extinction at the moment. Well, if you can get a self-sustaining colony on Mars
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.860]   Simulation yeah, that's a balance. We're still done
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.260]   So I did see the rumor. Hey, he's going for bonus points
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:03.980]   I did see the rumor and I like this that Elon and others who believe like he does that we are living in a simulation have secretly funded and
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:09.280]   This scares the hell out of me research to break through the matrix
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.580]   Research I feel like I'm reading a war on Ellis story
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.300]   You know where he goes into a fictional universe and brings somebody back or just hacks hacks the bleed
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.220]   Are they trying to find the blue pill? What are they trying to do?
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.900]   Hang on should if you break out of the game they just press reset and we're back to sort of you know
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.900]   Wasn't another quarter. It's the button
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.820]   We're back to Romeo
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:39.100]   See again was he born outside the US he's born in South Africa. Yes, that if you can get an idea
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.300]   Yeah
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.740]   But he came here at a young age
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.080]   It's he and it's a Elon and his brother. I think whose brother a lot of time in a hot tub is
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.260]   discussing this apparently a hot tub dimension machine. Yeah
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.420]   Yeah, I think you spend a lot of time in a hot tub with maybe
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.660]   finest
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.660]   The line between genius and madman is very very thin and it's either way like he could be proven totally right eventually
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.140]   It's just I think there's no way. I think it's similar to the question of does God exist
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   I don't I don't know if there's any way to prove it you
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.660]   Just what's gonna go on for five hours now
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.180]   It's John Carmack discovered God and it's John Carmack God is John Carmack. That's right
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.060]   So let's talk about the Google event on
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.720]   Tuesday October 4th. This was the thing that really bugged me because I was in the air and I get on the plane
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   Is there Wi-Fi and he said no sir? I'm sorry
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.460]   You fly British Airways
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.220]   Many we'll let you because I know on air Canada Wi-Fi you can't stream video regardless of
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:50.340]   Morning I'm at sea listening to the debate at it was 4 a.m. I we were in Russia
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.940]   But I'm listening actually not even
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.020]   Hacking you computer and putting it on there
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.740]   To listen to the audio and it actually was kind of fun
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:07.580]   It you know remember they they always said in the 1960 Nixon Kennedy debate the people who watched it had a different opinion
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:13.460]   They thought that Kennedy won and the people who listened thought that Nixon won because they couldn't see his sweaty upper lip
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.660]   In the case of this last debate
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:21.540]   I think the people on audio had a worst impression because the sniffing was much louder. Oh really? Oh my god
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.460]   I'm really what is going I'm I can't I'm trying to imagine what's going on
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:34.780]   Excuse me while I press the line and then it was right anyway not to get somebody somebody at the New York Times
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:40.740]   Watched with no sound on they did the opposite. Yeah, it was just as bad either way. I think yeah
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.300]   It's gonna be I can't tell Alec Baldwin from the real thing anymore. I think that was wild
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:53.420]   But the reason I bring that up. There's a tech angle to that is T-Mobile versus Google Fi overseas
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:59.180]   You loved Google Fi in Germany. I think it was right. Yes works pretty well not for you
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.700]   It worked okay
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:06.740]   But I was really amazed and I don't know if this is a short-term thing T-Mobile over the summer said higher speeds
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:12.540]   Then they extended it but in most cases my iPhone 7 running T-Mobile out
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:19.180]   Paste my 6p running Google Fi really yeah, I would go back at 4th
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.940]   But now I've used to my ball in Europe and I find it it's it was good
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.540]   It's great. It was good in every country we would and as soon as we got close to the
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:36.740]   Coast even though we're sailing the Baltic we were near land enough that I wasn't without internet a lot of that time
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.660]   Jay Jason got worried during the Google announcement that it was Verizon only
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.300]   But I bought the unlocked which should be no problem the good well
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:51.500]   And if you've already seen I'm sure the andrey police story that said whatever you do don't buy it from Verizon
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.620]   No, because you don't get the updates. They've already said oh no not updated as fast. Yeah
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.180]   You get media partnerships Leo you get media partnerships with oh, thank you
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:09.380]   And you know Verizon Google's apparently doesn't have the cloud Apple does you know Verizon will put the Verizon crap wear on there
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.660]   Yeah, Taylor Swift on security had a little
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.980]   Mars technicals thank you and that was that Ronna Mario
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:21.660]   Yeah, Ronna Mario. Sorry Ron. I owe you he says if you like updates don't buy it from Verizon
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.980]   No, I mean, that's just I mean I've when I first came here
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:30.340]   I used Verizon I've been shafted by them enough like a kiss rather than that with a credit card, but no the
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.380]   I'd never go for a reason because as to say the whole point about getting a pixel is that you get the software earlier you get the
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.960]   Security updates earlier if you're relying relying on Verizon to push that through then don't bother
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.340]   Seriously don't bother it was a little frustrating excuse me. Excuse me breaking news breaking news breaking news
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   Mark Zuckerberg is doing Facebook live barbie queene in his backyard right now
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:56.080]   Can we pull that up ladies and gentlemen? We were gonna pause this version of Twitter
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.180]   Did he actually gonna show himself killing butchering deep frying turkey?
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:08.300]   It's oh by the way. Thank you for joining us the day before Canadian Thanksgiving
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.460]   And I wish I had all ready to all our friends in Canada
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.940]   Yeah, we have it early because of the frost like the harvest we have to you have to get all stuff done first
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.500]   Ian asked an interesting you're going before the show began. What exactly are you thankful for?
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.540]   So, I mean, it's the same thing for America. It's that it's the harvest festival. It's just the harvest
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:32.120]   In America, we're thankful the first Thanksgiving wasn't it because it pimped Plymouth because
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.540]   Squanto and the Indians kept the pilgrims from starving to death. Yeah by bringing squash
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.840]   Yeah, and in exchange you killed them all. Yeah, yeah, you gave them small. No, I'm sure it's I'm sure it's similar here
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.820]   We just probably made up some very good to that folk story and then and then just had a regular harvest festival anyway
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.980]   It's a harvest festival. Yes, it's I'm just surprised. We don't have Easter a month early a month late because you have to wait for it to defrost
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   I mean, there's no there's no harmony here
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.900]   It's the pumpkin space time has come. Yeah, it is never pumping pumpkin spice time
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.220]   I've tried that once and it is their food of the devil should be
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.540]   thrown away instantly you can't just try pumpkin spice
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.500]   Yeah, try it in something I'd be
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:19.060]   Try that again, and it was pumpkin spices like mugging for the tongue, you know, it's just oh
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:25.300]   Did you order Leo? Did you order a pixel which one I did so we got off the plane and it was already sold out
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.140]   I wanted it, you know October 20th, which one all of the blue all of them
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.420]   I got my I got my urine if you wanted to get it
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.340]   The fastest you had to do it right away. It's very similar to an apple debut
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.060]   But I'm gonna get it in early November and I but I couldn't get the blue
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.140]   But I didn't want the one that was only 32 gigabytes 32. Yeah, that's the Canadian store. There was no blue
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.840]   I felt completely shafted you don't want what do you want a blue phone?
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.500]   I would have like a nice Canadian red phone. They didn't have that either
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.180]   I wanted I had to have 128 gigs. I had to so I ordered 128, but I couldn't get the XL in
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.400]   That side you know so I didn't get the little one
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:08.060]   Good experiment first of all I haven't had a five inch phone since blackberry right so that's gonna
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.340]   You're not gonna like it. You're gonna hate it, and I'm curious what the battery life will be it's probably better than a
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:20.380]   Detach me must be honest. Yeah, it'll charge it'll charge to seven hours in in 15. I was blown away by that is that last thing
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.380]   I want right now
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.940]   I'm gonna put it on a five volt charger just wait
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:31.740]   See if it gets you see I'm kind of skeptical about the fast charge thing because when I was testing out the 5x and the 6p
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.540]   Yeah, you could get 50% within
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:42.180]   20 minutes 25 minutes or so, but that last 15% you had to leave the damn thing plugged in for another half an hour now
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.180]   So there's a real hour and a half
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.940]   Let me interrupt, but this just in from Mark Zuckerberg
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.420]   Back here. Yeah, no, this is this is my weekend thing. I love this
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.620]   I just go I'm doing my a triathlon and running training and then
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:03.060]   He's got a big green egg. I love the big green egg. Yeah, you're gonna do it for Duncan
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.820]   Wow, I'm watching watching right now on Twitter
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:15.340]   More fewer than are watching mark 73.7 thousand people are watching Mark Zuckerberg
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.280]   Wax on about his barbecue style and we just pause culture right now
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.240]   Hopefully soon. I had a really good time legos was
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.620]   Was pretty amazing the the entrepreneurial energy. Yeah, right when he was in Legos the really
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.140]   Yeah, that was kind of embarrassing
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.660]   Wiring
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.620]   Green egg is they have the microphone and camera covered on that too? I can't
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.620]   You know he does have it looks like a wire coming out of it. He must have some sort of
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:55.820]   A billion and I've got one of those seats beside
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:07.580]   Because it's huge news we just discovered something what's that it's not a great t-shirt. It's purple. Oh, it's purple
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.580]   It must be the weekend this is the weekend
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.500]   Wusti so what I'm curious about is if it's just mark sitting in his yard
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.940]   He's got a laptop and a camera or if there's 25 technicians
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:27.700]   Yeah, almost do we know what I'm calling Kelly who works for Facebook doing streaming video
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.780]   Somehow I feel like it's the latter. Yeah, they're a halo rig all around me
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.300]   It's it's very well. He's got thousands of people watching him
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.900]   So the presentation that he gave the other week about how he and his wife were going to kill the world of all known diseases and it was
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:49.180]   I mean, I admire his plug but for goodness sake get some get a sense of hubris inviting in in this and it just yeah, yeah
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.460]   Phil esophical question here
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:58.060]   Does intense fame and unimaginable wealth make you crazy?
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.180]   Or do you have to be crazy to get?
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.740]   Well, you wish you knew
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.780]   Yeah, I think that's a little west wing here, but yes
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.700]   I think for the majority of certainly people have met in the tech sphere
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:18.220]   They are very smart very committed people who happen to become incredibly wealthy with a few exceptions
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:24.940]   There are complete psychos who got very very very wealthy very quickly and not mentioning anyone
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.740]   And there they have
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.540]   about mark and elan particularly yeah
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.740]   Or tibs or gay and larry with their party bus
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.900]   Same thing yeah, they said like that before and then maybe this somehow facilitated their
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:45.660]   $20 billion in my 20s. I think I would be dead now. I would just give you I can I can fly this plane
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.860]   I can dive under this ocean. I would just do it
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.500]   I remember listening to an interview with one of the bransman children
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:57.020]   He said that he's devoted his life to rebuilding buildings with eco-friendliness because he knew if he didn't have a defined purpose
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.620]   That money would drive him would very good. It was all context. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He ended up like dad
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.660]   So before they did their analysis of the health thing
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.140]   Uh, there was a picture of of mark and his wife sitting on a couch
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.020]   There was a whiteboard behind him and I said in the comments
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.460]   I said I just I just thought for a second to give a whiteboard in your house
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.620]   But I realized you're into your office and he said well, but we do have a whiteboard of course they do
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.780]   Where they can reinvent the world, you know, I'm I'd be tempted actually
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.060]   Uh to get that whiteboard paint and just paint all the walls with it. Oh, I love that. I love that
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:37.260]   This has become a very discursive twit and it's because I'm back and I'm just so thrilled to be back with my friends talking
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.500]   And there's all this stuff I want to talk and so much happened and so much happened. Yep
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:47.740]   Pixel phone. All right. So here was the big one for me when I got down and I started watching
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.380]   At the coverage and then uh watching our coverage with Jason and and but also
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.260]   Uh the videos and reading the stories
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.900]   Sticker shock a ramma. Yeah
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.740]   What the what this this is not the nexus
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.260]   Yeah, they're supposed to let me pay with my data leo that was our deal
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.740]   Like I give apple money for tiny objects and I give google data for shiny objects
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.380]   Canada and australia sounds really
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.980]   $1,000 if he was close to $1,300 from my pixel excel with the protection plan
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.140]   Um, that makes apple prices look reasonable
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.540]   What very few things my capital prices look reasonable, but I do take your point
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.300]   They are obviously going for the premium market and they figure they can do it
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.780]   You know people will buy on the google brand well people are willing to pay silly money on the apple
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.780]   Baud brand because it's got proven
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.460]   Design chops and technical jobs as well and sex appeal
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:48.780]   No one has actually got ooh, that's a google phone. That's sexy, you know, it just doesn't work that way and as much as I like the nexus is
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.060]   um
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.740]   They've never had the fit and finish of a single iPhone and especially the later
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.260]   Latter-day iPhones like the seven these things are
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.420]   I mean just them well they were meant to be developer phones like they were ludicrously low price
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.860]   Some of them
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.620]   I love I love the phone
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.820]   Yeah, a lot
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.900]   Yeah, all right. All right, so what is that you're holding up?
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.660]   Wait a minute is that what is that that's the six B
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:17.100]   But if you look here's the question Jeff if you look at an iPhone 7 here's the jet black iPhone 7
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.940]   I know this is a this is like should be
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.420]   And there should be a lot of art. I mean
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.540]   Every hand can be if it feels like it was like some craftsman
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.220]   Okay, but here's the issue with the nexus with the nude with a pixel
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:35.020]   I have to believe that that there is no hardware tie to the AI thing
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.260]   It's a temporary thing you get some benefit to use it directly. You can still use aloe not a big deal
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.700]   Number two the camera. Okay. It's a better camera, but that's it. DX. What mark says it's the best camera fine
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.380]   Yeah, there are two you trust them Renee. I mean, uh, so
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:55.660]   So let's say uh, no, I don't well for a couple reasons and I think uh, Matthew pans arena explained this really really well the other day
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.260]   It will one is that they make products
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.100]   It's always hard to have a scale when you when you're selling that big ad at the bottom for your camera
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.420]   But the other thing is that the scores they give them the scores and then the scores are generational
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.460]   But they don't really change so there's a bunch of cameras that came out two years ago
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.540]   That are obviously worse but still score high because the scale is never a high for that
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.940]   Yeah for that time and it's unclear what this like I believe the pixel has an outstanding camera
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.580]   I think there's a whole bunch of smarts in it, but what do those two numbers mean like what what is the differential there?
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.180]   I think they don't do a great job
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:28.540]   And explaining it which is why like I'll wait for the an ant tech review or some of the other reviews like that to tell me what's going on
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.180]   Well, and also there's more than optics involved
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:37.420]   Software that apple the stuff apple doesn't software to those images is pretty remarkable
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.380]   I have to say I came back I took I took an iPhone 7 on the trip specifically the 7 plus
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.780]   To to take a lot of pictures and I also took a very high end
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.980]   Like a camera and I have to say many of the images are more pleasing from the iPhone
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.260]   Yeah, um the like is a good job with the noise like on the portrait mode. They really tuned the noise
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.580]   They did they do a disc blur
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.020]   Effect and they tuned the noise to look like old style film so even when you're in low light
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.020]   It doesn't look like the best digital photo in the world
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:11.340]   But it's got this incredible humanistic feeling that feels like in the old days when you took a film photo and it wasn't quite the right light or speed
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.820]   But you just loved the memory it gave you and they've been very good at tapping into the the emotional resonance
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.940]   So we shouldn't we shouldn't credit this score of 89 eyes score dx o marks ever given that it's a
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:26.140]   But at least say it's a decent camera. Okay, so yeah, it looks great. Yeah, so this huge price
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:32.540]   I don't see what what is the real let's be really on no. Oh, yeah, it's just like advantage right over the six p
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.300]   uh
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.580]   assistant
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.620]   Yeah, type google integration again. That's that is a marketing ploy. I think
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.260]   Well, I know I would like to know what's the difference between okay google and the new google assistant
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.740]   What is the difference and well not only the only on the president knows
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:55.100]   They're arguing this is the only phone with assistant because why because they chose to make it that not because there is any hardware connection
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.340]   That makes it only possible. No, no, no, no. Can they yeah?
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.780]   Yeah, can't they turn on a
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.100]   Of course they can't make it available. They would have to code it though
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:06.460]   Like I think it's a tight into like it they they have limited resources and they were able to do the tight integration on this phone first
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.780]   And then maybe they'll go and backport it to other phones
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.380]   But it's just and by the way the google home, which they also announced an echo
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.500]   competitor. Yeah, and that will also what's the type today? What's what's that tight integration mean?
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.660]   I don't think I think it's software only jeff. I agree. I think you can yeah
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:27.340]   You might make the case that google didn't want to roll it out into you know phone and red wine extra chip
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.460]   They can be pulled into the os
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.620]   They can build it right into the os the way syria's built into the os and with the existing phones that have to go back and
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:39.180]   React it to them like I think it's it's imminently possible. It just their timelines are different. Okay, but yeah
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:44.140]   I've got a google phone. I've got a 6p for them to add back in the AI capability this
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:49.100]   I've not heard any reason why that's not switch with the global exactly I have to think this is bits
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:55.260]   This is the only differentiator that they could offer on this phone. So why spend this fortune?
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:00.460]   Well, I get tempted. This is my neuroses. I do this every time on this on these shows
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.860]   So I've ordered it immediately because I'm neuro like that way and then I turn around and say am I wasting nearly a thousand dollars?
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.940]   And I just canceled a sucker
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.180]   My thing is also if I don't want an iPhone like I don't want an iPhone like I love getting this phone because no one in the world
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.820]   Is the windows phone?
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.780]   I have one of each I have
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.980]   These I have nexus is I try to get one of each platform
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.980]   But I like that they're all different so I I tend to gravitate towards the more extreme
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.540]   Are you sad that blackberry is finally thrown in the towel and says we're not gonna make hardware anymore?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.660]   I'm sad as a Canadian because like we lost north. Oh, we lost
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:39.740]   effects we've lost all these we very few companies had their own operating systems in Canada had two they had both
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:46.620]   BBOS and they had qnx and blackberry famously bought qnx and now all the big brains from qnx work for apple
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:53.020]   That's great, but it doesn't really help Canada. So as a Canadian I think it's a it's an describable loss to our technology second. Yeah
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.500]   Yeah end of an era certainly
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   Happen, you know, it really had to happen
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.060]   They missed the market 10 years ago and they never got it back
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:09.260]   It's it's really a morality tale when you look at both microsoft and blackberry both underestimated in 2007 what the iPhone was going to do
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.940]   Uh to the phone business the cell phone business
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:20.860]   Both of them poo pooed it and waited and not waited long at microsoft got its first new windows phone platform three years later
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.380]   It was still
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:30.620]   Just enough too late that developers ignored it blackberry was even later and the first few things they did like the blackberry storm were so horrible
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.660]   Oh the
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.300]   Internally codename the yeah, well the tablet they didn't build phones for years they could get that tablet out
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:41.660]   I mean the whole thing even microsoft if they had they didn't realize the consumer phone if they'd made an xbox phone that ran
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.220]   Halo and put it on every store shelf. Maybe they'd have a shot left in the consumer market, but
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.380]   They they're branding everything just scream. Don't please do not buy me
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:56.460]   But you see at least blackberry did something, you know everyone talks about apple invented the smartphone rubbish apple blackberry
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.740]   Blackberry made the smartphone absolutely essential apple just made it look pretty
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:06.460]   But microsoft has been trying to do a mobile operating system back since winter as a windows se
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:12.860]   And they just hasn't worked all the way along the line. They're too locked into their particular mindset
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.580]   So, I mean I'm also blackberry
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:20.220]   But you know at least they did something with the market blackberry back they grew up from a pager where apple
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.020]   Just wanted to put a computer like we have we have mix boxes in our pockets now
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:28.540]   Everybody would probably thought microsoft would be everywhere now and we're all walking around whether using android or iphone
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:33.900]   Uh, and you have unix in your pocket and it's a very different era has the worm turned or what? Yeah
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.660]   Um, all right. I want to talk so I pixel
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:44.060]   It'll be out it starts shipping october 20th if you ordered it today you wouldn't get it till the following months
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.540]   a very expensive
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.980]   Doesn't seem to have a lot of differentiating features perhaps the only differentiating the camera though leo
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.580]   I want to know. Oh, yes, but they say that it does a really good job
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.620]   In software about like stabilizing the video
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.100]   Usually the video stabilization looked remarkable, but how much cropped was that like usually when you do
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:09.340]   You do electronics. They've like you crop it a lot. Yeah, so I I want to see what that results like and also again
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.740]   Like what jess said what are you getting for those wait a minute?
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.620]   Wait a minute. I'm thinking back to the event when they talked about the video stabilization
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:22.540]   They said a gyroscope measures the motion of the phone 200 times a second. There is
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.300]   Hardware stabilization for video in there. There's just not
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.620]   Yeah, so the lens is not moving it's the gyroscope is adjusting it
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.420]   But I don't know when the lens is moving you still get the full frame of that lens
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   I don't know what happens when the gyroscope is internally adjusting for and they did not mention
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.220]   Whether that does anything for stills if they're going to use the same technology or no technology
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.700]   It didn't sound like it. Yeah, we just have to wait and see
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:50.380]   We also see about the unlimited thing because somebody called the radio show and said, you know, I talked to google
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:55.580]   The the deal was the way they publicized it is if you're using a pixel phone
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.660]   You have unlimited original quality storage. Ah, but
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.340]   It's big big butt on that of the j-pens. Oh, yeah
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.060]   If you're sticking to their standard 16 megapixel
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:13.820]   Resolution then fine you get limited storage if you want to if you have your phone setting higher
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:20.220]   And you want to store those raw images then it goes against your 15 your 15 terabytes storage limit
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.420]   So there there is a kicker to that one. So that's good. Thank you for clarifying because I I thought
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:31.900]   Well, that's not the impression I got but in fact, it's jpegs only think of it like micha's often unlimited storage
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.740]   Yeah, they can talk about it all they like but the reality of the situation is slightly different
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.140]   So another differentiator
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.260]   Gone by the way, so I'm not sure that this pixel phone is going to do
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:48.540]   So I can see another unboxing reboxing coming up in my future. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm I'm hopefully
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.020]   I'm going to be getting the the review kit on the 18th. Okay, crossed
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.900]   Okay, the one thing that does worry me about the camera and this is something
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.460]   I've just done a year's round up of living with the 5x
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.620]   And the onlyophobic coating on the 5x degenerated within about six months. That's the king
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.860]   That's the makes it easy to wipe off. Yeah, that's great
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:12.940]   But that also went for the lens as well. So I was getting some fairly smirry photos and that's I took great care of the lens
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:19.580]   So, um, yeah, hopefully it's it's gonna be good, but we'll let you know Renee case or no on the jet black iPhone
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:24.540]   I don't I don't have cases on mine because I just I like I like the looks a lot and so far
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.140]   But you got the mat that's matt. I have both I have the jet black on the shelf over there
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:32.780]   I have the the seven in the jet black and the the seven plus in in the map black
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.540]   I wanted to see both new colors. What do you think?
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:40.700]   Cancer no case always get a case for your smartphone. Think of it. I think how much that cost and think how much that cost
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.700]   I know but the one that's like wearing a condom
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:50.300]   Millennium falcon had no case Leo. I didn't look beautiful. Yeah, it did. Yeah, I mean
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:55.180]   She called the case they have for the pixel was ugly. It's it's it's a it's a junky piece of clear plastic
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.500]   Or it's some colored junky thing. Look at look at look at the cases. They're off. Yeah
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.300]   I like my six p case. It has this kind of no, I like it all six p
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.820]   Carpet like like the like the google, uh, you know what Jeff
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:12.220]   Don't even unbox just throw it away. Send away. You don't want it. You don't need that pixel phone
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.540]   Get rid of it. We agree though that the age of
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:20.380]   Cancel is over because there was such hate that you know apple still had bezels and now google saying yeah bezels are cool
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.580]   Huge bezels coming back. You know who doesn't have bezels
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.660]   Samsung yeah and their phones explode so
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:35.180]   What is that bezels equal exploding phones? Okay bezels puffer post hoc propter hoc
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.500]   Or something
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.780]   Uh, what about uh, okay, so somebody some wagon. I wish I could find this
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.700]   headline said google announces copies of
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:50.380]   iPhone amazon echo roku gear vr and
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.020]   Eero
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.540]   Cuz you know like famously I mean there were i there were music players before the ipod
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.740]   They were phones before the iphone they were tablets before the ip so to me
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.460]   There's this thing called copy forward when you say great art is steel
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.900]   It doesn't mean you do a bit by bit pixel by pixel atom by atom copy
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.180]   But you take what's come before the best of it and you carry that forward because humans shouldn't have to learn different ways of using
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.180]   All these things there are very good ways of using it and you build on that and you take it forward
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:20.380]   Now you can argue that the industrial design of the pixel or the utility of the google home
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.380]   Isn't a significant enough drive forward
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:28.460]   But for some people just being able to log into their google account instead of an i cloud account or an amazon account is exactly the functionality
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.300]   They wanted that device so I think we have to judge them not on their me to witness
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.820]   But on there on the actual execution of the devices what I do see it
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:42.700]   I think is interesting is that uh google might be taking might be I say taking a page from apple apple's really built
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:50.380]   Their business on a closed ecosystem where everything interacts with everything else and bek and it's strongly incensed the consumer to buy all
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.260]   Apple what you know your watch can wake up your computer
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.540]   Your can copy and paste from your computer your phone it all works together seamlessly in theory
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:06.140]   Uh google has in the past kind of been more open like we're gonna work with everybody aloe is both ios and android that kind of thing
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:13.340]   But now with this new range of products and incidentally no mention at all of chrome books or android where yeah, which really
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:20.220]   Yeah, or this dual operating system code name. Yeah android where got pushed back. I think till next year
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.220]   nevertheless it looks like google's
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:30.220]   Forget copying all those devices is copying the idea of a closed ecosystem that if you have a google phone
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:35.500]   You're gonna want the google home because it's the same assistant. It knows the same things about you that kind of thing
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:41.420]   They already have that up to a point. I mean I've been trying to switch my wife onto android from ios and it's just not happening because
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.620]   You know she doesn't use gmail. She uses null terms of webmail provider. So she's then got to set that up
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.060]   That's a good point if you have a gmail account android makes a lot more
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.380]   Makes a huge amount much more sense
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:58.860]   But there is a there's a price with that in that it's kind of like apple microsoft microsoft point commodity apple when
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.060]   Long total lock it flips left and it works really well
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:08.460]   You know if you've got all the bits working in sequence if google hasn't then the entire thing falls apart
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:14.860]   You just become an expensive tie-in so but what what's also like if you're not if you how does it work with the google apps
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.580]   Jeff
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.300]   I am fearing that
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:25.500]   Really, you know what i'm really worried about google home works with only one google account currently
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.620]   So there's an out of people of ropian apps account
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:34.220]   You know, there's a lot of questions leo. Yeah, have I been should I just here's the question. Yes, send it back
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:40.460]   Cancel by the way. No, no, no, no my other question. So now we have a label apps now called what is it g-spot?
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.020]   Yes, g-suite
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.940]   Well because my favorite spot from now on it's impossible to find
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:52.300]   G-suite wait for the ads to say google grab it by the g-spot. Oh
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.580]   Yeah
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:02.220]   So the thing that seems like a couple things interest me here when you're not when you're more pessimistic about this the companies tend to
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.820]   Control what makes them money and try to fragment what makes their competitors money
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.780]   So companies are only as open as what they want to disrupt voice and voice of uh wisdom there
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:16.300]   You're right. Yeah, so when when companies become more successful like google needs to be open when they're starting off because they need to be on every device because
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.460]   Their business requires requires scale
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.020]   As you start owning the customer experience then it makes sense to be more integrated because you can take those oil customers
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.500]   And reward them with a greater value that comes from you know
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.260]   You want them to think buying the next thing like you said is greater and greater value
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:34.940]   The interesting thing with the home product is one of my understandings is like your apple hasn't made one they've been experimenting with it for years
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.300]   Because series a personal assistant and not a multi personal assistant
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.700]   And if you're at home leo and you go read me my text messages
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:46.380]   How does series know whether it's yours or lisa's or your kids and that tapples a huge privacy problem?
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.820]   Where's my calendar appointment?
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:53.420]   Which account gets that calendar appointment and they don't ever want to leak data from or your work and you suddenly say something to your assistant
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.860]   And your secretary is listening to your information or your partner is listening to it
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.540]   So until you solve the multi the multi personal assistant problem
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:06.940]   They don't want to put hardware in the amazon echo of course amazon doesn't have anywhere near the kind of data about me that google and apple do
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.220]   But the amazon echo does allow me to switch between amazon accounts
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.340]   Yeah
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:15.900]   Uh, so and the only reason I use that at all is for audible because I have an audible account at least as an audible account
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.460]   And it'll I'll have it read and I could say google read to me
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:25.260]   And or I'm sorry amazon read to me and it will read to me from my account or I could say amazon switch accounts
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:30.540]   And then it'll read to me and it'll read to me or reach elisa's account. Here's my here's my question about about gspop
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.380]   I'm just gonna call it that now. I'm sorry
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.380]   I
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.900]   Should I just abandon apps and go ahead and and port
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:46.220]   My email into a regular gmail account and give up
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.980]   There's no reason to have apps unless you're a company. Just don't bother
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:56.380]   I still use it. I mean we still use it. It always feels like gmail gets the gets everything before you know apps
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:01.340]   Not like just before when these don't don't happen. It's all we have of course we use google apps at twit
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:07.500]   We have a big corporate account. Everybody has a the twit.t if you are at twit.tv. That's actually a google apps
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.660]   Yeah, we use the game with
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.500]   From from our and I refuse to do it
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.900]   I have a twit.tv address. I don't use it. I use my gmail address
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.820]   Uh, I use gmail. I don't I rarely use the company
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.100]   Account because I want all the features of google, right?
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:29.340]   Yeah, I don't know I tend to keep working private life very separate. So I keep my gmail account private
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.620]   My guess will differ for me. This is my private. Well, yeah, there is that
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:36.060]   in my buddwa
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:40.700]   Uh, I I think google is going to uh, stumble here not
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:46.700]   With a google home. I think that this is going to be a very difficult ecosystem for them to penetrate
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:53.020]   I don't think anybody wants multiple devices on their mantle piece and multiple commands and different
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:58.940]   Yeah, I just think that's not going to work. Um, I'm gonna say there's this three and one for the wi-fi set up
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.100]   They've got how many routers do you need for goodness?
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.940]   That is
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.620]   Yeah, we have a sponsor called aero that does the same thing. This is essentially
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.900]   Ubiquity is
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.540]   Ubiquity's done this for years. Ubiquity pioneered it
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.660]   But they had it was very difficult for a normal user
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:18.540]   Even sonos to some extent like they're they're a mesh network. You don't think about it that way. Yeah, because it's not a router
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.380]   Yeah, but just get a router get a run with three aerials
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.860]   You make your own
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.860]   Point them in the right direction a lot of people
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.860]   You don't have to mention you
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.340]   When you're in the penthouse you need because it's uh, it's
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.860]   Lot this has actually become a huge problem even in apartments because of congestion
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:44.460]   There's about a million right but also just distances and so I I do think that these are there are better ways
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:50.540]   We it's about time we revolutionized. Uh, in fact, I'm waiting for apple to get off. It's duff
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:54.140]   It's been sitting on the airport extreme for how many years now
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:56:00.780]   Uh several but again like this is the this is the thing that you you can external experiment with software when you start experimenting with atoms
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.940]   And I was about to say that about google home
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.460]   Google is at its best when they put everything behind it and they say we're gonna do google home
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.860]   We're gonna own it we'll put it on the market and we'll iterate and we'll iterate and we'll iterate and we'll make it great
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.900]   Google's at their worst when they're like, uh, here's this wave thing
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.060]   Maybe it will exist three months from now
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:19.020]   And people are less tolerant with that with atoms like the the nest stuff
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.860]   I think is a great example of yeah how people feel don't feel support the product right?
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:28.220]   Uh, and you that's really hard to do so apple's thing is like is the airport express should it just be a
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.980]   Uh, router should it be a mesh router?
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.260]   Should it be something that downloads all your iCloud information all your updates?
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.940]   You know to your local servers you don't have to wait for them anymore. Should it preload that stuff?
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.060]   Should it give you serif functionality? How do we do multi-person series?
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.820]   How do we do beamforming properly?
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:46.140]   So they they're gonna answer all these questions and then best case they put out an iphone worst case
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.260]   They put out an apple watch in a couple of years later. It's it's much more coherent
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:55.340]   But they tend to do that experimenting internally and I think sometimes they do it too much and things like macbooks or
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.140]   routers or other things just language in the meantime
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.260]   Let's take a break. We'll have more reine richy from imore
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:07.020]   From the register dot code dot uk. I always say that so they can find it. Yeah. Yeah
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:12.220]   We're sticking with the dot code at uk URL because we're traditional that way cute. Uh, we like it in Thompson
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:19.100]   Uh abandoned europe soon. Yeah. Oh, he's he's gonna. Hey, don't worry. We'll be coming back for this country once
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.100]   You know you've you screwed it up enough
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.820]   Yeah
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:31.820]   Right about now i'm thinking a queen and a prime minister looks pretty darn good
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:39.500]   Jeff Jarvis is also here from uh city university New York buzz machine dot com as his blog stop it stop the
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.540]   free plugs
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.820]   He apparently is with her
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.460]   Uh, and we'll have more in just a moment our show today brought to you by go to meeting
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:57.740]   Uh, if you are having a phone conferences and I think in any business you're gonna have phone conferences both with clients and in with colleagues
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.860]   Right, especially nowadays with businesses are distributed all over the world
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.580]   Uh, I want to recommend you try something else
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:09.820]   It's just as good as a phone conference. In fact, it could start as a phone conference, but it becomes much more very quickly. It's go to
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:15.180]   Meeting the high tech leader you can start them go to meeting very easily
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.940]   They have a plugin for outlook you click a link
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:21.260]   Send the link to your client or colleague it's very easy even if they've never used it
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.420]   They click the link the software installs
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:28.060]   All of a sudden they're up and running and it could just be a phone bridge just like your regular conference bridge, but then
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:34.460]   Here's where the magic starts. You so I you know, let me show you what we're talking about you turn on screen sharing suddenly
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:40.060]   They're seeing your powerpoint presentation or maybe you're working together on a document you can collaborate
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.500]   And then even better you say, eh, you know what? I'd like to see
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:49.900]   What how you feel about all this will turn on your camera? I'm gonna turn on my camera suddenly you got crystal clear hd video
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.180]   It's like being in the same room on the same page
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.820]   It is so much better whether it's a sales demo a presentation
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:02.460]   A collaborative or ad hoc meeting go to meeting every moment counts
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:10.300]   With go to meeting nobody likes meetings, but if they can be more productive more efficient get the job done better without travel
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:18.540]   That's gotta be good. Just ask nine out of ten go to meeting users say they close deals more than 20 percent faster

[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.740]   tech so
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.340]   Just because google doesn't mention chrome books doesn't mean they're not gonna
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.460]   Yeah
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.380]   He is sitting here with a pixel no no i've got i've got a pixel and i'm
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:54.060]   A little concerned jeff moses pixel yeah, I think they're taking their after ball when it comes to the chrome
[00:59:54.060 --> 01:00:01.980]   You're right how about so i'm also using the the pixel c which i love yeah, that's a bad that's orphaned you can travel with it
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.300]   That's fine. Do you have linux on your pixel on your on your uh chrome book lio
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.300]   Uh, yeah, sometimes sometimes not crouton makes it very easy
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.380]   Yeah, um, I you know what the problem is it turns off the secure boot
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.580]   And I really like the security of chrome books
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.860]   And I kind of like that idea that i'm just using it as it is now that I can put android on there
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.820]   Have you guys been playing with the android store playing about with i mean i know what you mean about the security i take my
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.900]   Crumbled to defcon and other hacking conk really. Yeah, you feel safe. Yeah, I lock it down. Do you power wash it when you get home?
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.620]   Uh, I I basically scrubbed the entire thing and start again from scratch, but that's just what you do
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:43.020]   I put my name in about two minutes and 30 seconds, right? Well, it's fast. It's easy. I mean I
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:50.380]   Now I recommend every time I talk to normal people I say get a crumb book forget this windows mac just get a crumb wow
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:55.740]   Yeah, i'm coming 180 degrees. Yeah, I don't go that far. You can't game on a crumb book there
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.020]   There's well
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:03.740]   There are people who need windows or mac they know who they are they're gamers or their rocket ship design final cut licenses
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.140]   Yeah, or they're yeah, they're editing video or their photographs
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.740]   They know that and they're probably more willing to take on
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.620]   The responsibility of a general purpose operating system you need to be a security expert
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:20.220]   You need to kind of be willing to mess with it when it stops working right because it's such a complex beast
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.700]   A crumb book is for normal people
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.740]   And if you don't know you need a general person
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.980]   Yeah, if you know you don't know the general purpose operating system you should be getting a crumb book
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.820]   You should only get window windows used to be the default. Oh well again a computer
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.780]   You're gonna get windows right now. I think the crumb book is the default. I think it's become it's outsold Macintosh
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:43.180]   Well, you know what bothers me is is that I mean all right so they don't want to come out with a new crumb book for
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.060]   Nine months or a year, but they don't make all the old one. Well, they stopped didn't they?
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.540]   My breaks. I'm I'm screwing but bear in mind crumb books
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.820]   I think they've got a schedule up, but it looks like they're only gonna be supported for about three three and a half years
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:02.860]   Yes now Google may change on that when people suddenly stop finding dead machines in there. So what's Andromeda?
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.380]   And what does this mean for crumbock crumb OS?
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.580]   Really
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:20.220]   It's just rumors that it's a hybrid OS we've had that promise before that they were gonna finally bring together
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.580]   Android and and and crumb books
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.540]   Chrome OS and they haven't well, they should have demo bit and I owe
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.860]   And they showed a demo of firing up Android apps within the chrome OS
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:38.940]   Yeah, and drama is a true combination by rumor of the two OS's
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.980]   Whereas sounds
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:48.460]   Um, no, it's been it's been guessed for a long time and and reportedly it's being tested on nexus nines
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.780]   Uh, but my fear is that I know Google's attitude
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.540]   I mean two years ago when I sat down with them about like Google plus bear rest in peace
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.660]   I made some complaints about things I wanted three years but go maybe now
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:05.020]   Things I wanted in the in the web version. They said web are you kidding? We don't do anything with that anymore
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:10.860]   We just do mobile. That's all we do is mobile AI. So my fear is they're gonna abandon any idea of
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.460]   Of anything bigger than this is Google's biggest problem
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.420]   The abandonment problem. Yes, you can never trust Google
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.860]   Whether it's adam's rene or bits
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.500]   To stick with anything. Yes
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.140]   And this pixel thing just exacerbates the problem because we're floating in limbo
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:37.340]   They made a very expensive chrome book people who use it love it. Mm-hmm. The story is internally. This is you know people
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.980]   Inside google love it
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   Um, but they have not now
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:48.700]   Because google's chrome os and chromium chrome of browser and uh android our open source projects
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.980]   What happens is code leaks out and that's why we know about and drama
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.460]   We also in the code see traces of a new pixel
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.380]   Uh code named bison that you know, so
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:03.260]   You can start to see that in the code base
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.780]   But I think I'd be very nervous
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:12.140]   I tend to think like when you hear stories about ios and and macos for example merging or when you hear stories about
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.020]   chrome and android mode these are two very very different things with very different runtimes experiences
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.260]   Security models and all these things and it's often
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:24.460]   I think often we we see you know it makes sense to us because all we see is the front and for an individual
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:29.420]   The interface is the application so we see these front ends and we think oh I could just throw this app on here
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.180]   But you know, that's not how the plumbing works
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.420]   And I think if there is an Andromeda or there is a successor to all these operating systems
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.100]   It's something that comes next. It's what we did when we launched mobile to begin with
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.980]   They think it over they take the best from both things and they build a platform from the drivers back on up
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.260]   That does all the things they wanted to do instead of some sort of hodgepodge frankenstein o s that are really make nobody happy
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.260]   It's hardly this is your nightmare
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:55.100]   And i'm not sure exactly I understand the business rationale for doing it either
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.660]   It makes you understand why amazon makes you write the press release first before you make the product
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:05.580]   Jeff bays is very famously, you know when you present something you write the press release to present
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.660]   um google's autonomous car past just past two million miles
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.580]   Uh, that's a lot of miles. I was talking on a radio show
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:20.540]   I was doing a radio show in sepsica this week and somebody called it and said look how unreliable software is
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.180]   Are you gonna really trust your life to software and I had to point out well
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.580]   These so far these are the tasci drivers it could be you know
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.180]   That's what I said on sort of hyped up on coffee
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.180]   There were softwares well, yeah
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.420]   Yeah, so the first million miles took six years the next million 16 months
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.060]   I still want to see it like in canada or in russia or somewhere where there's precipitation
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.060]   Just to see if it thinks that rain is a wall. Yeah, it was interesting
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.060]   We got offered a ride in the google car, but this had you can't write about it if you if we do take you on
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:59.180]   Well, you can drive about it, but you can't write about it. So you can you can experience it but you can't tell them. Yeah
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:05.100]   But it's like we'll be generous. So we've got to write about it. It's a nice point. Yeah, it's um, but i don't get a
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:11.900]   Lots of people written about it. Yeah, yeah, I know it's just that we're not google's flavor of the month of the over the last couple of years
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:16.940]   But I mean they the self-driving car is all very good, but nobody has yet worked out
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:22.860]   Okay, supposing they do get it perfected california has now said autonomous cars can drive in a limited fashion on their roads
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:28.620]   Go 10 five 10 years down the line when we've got autonomous trucks and autonomous taxis and the rest of it
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:32.300]   What are the truck drivers and taxi drivers and school bus drivers going to do?
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:39.420]   They're not going to be able to retrain for jobs at google. So you've just basically cut about five million people out of the economy
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:45.820]   Yeah, so if you're if you're a truck driver or taxi driver, I wouldn't advise your kids to get into your profession. Yeah, no your kids
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.220]   What about you 10 years from now?
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.220]   Uh, it's this is this is trouble
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.260]   Yeah
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.820]   Um, unless you need someone in those trucks to make sure they can grab their wheel when the software throws it back at the human because it
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.100]   Just doesn't know what to do well, and I should point out that uh, coyote
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.340]   Well, that's while that's terrible news for people who drive and this said a lot of them
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.140]   This is means not going to happen. No, it did
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:10.380]   It almost happens. No, no, it absolutely will happen. I'm just saying that nobody's actually talking about
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.100]   What happens then, you know, I mean
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:19.180]   It was a story about uber like basically telling people that they're going to go driverless and they're they're hiring all these people as interim flesh bags
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.500]   Until they get the driver's
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.940]   You know if you were a you know a wonderful footman
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.180]   You were graded a horse and buggy operation you're out of work too and
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.740]   We're in plan makers. This is the way it goes
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:37.900]   But when we had the first big wave of industrialization that caused social chaos for 50 years you had revolutions across europe
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:43.180]   You don't think that's what's happening right now. It's getting very very close to that
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.260]   You don't think that's exactly what you're seeing is
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:52.460]   But there's a story that I'm seeing often now is that is that is that the what and this is going to be have a big effect on all of us who are around
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:59.020]   And love technology is that the impact on jobs is not not not immigrants to all those who are running for Donald trump
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.580]   It is it is technology exactly
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:07.660]   But whatever the reason that's the appeal of a Donald trump it were a brexit is
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.740]   Why we are we are dying here help us
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.780]   When the enemy becomes technology
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.500]   What happens then?
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   You look at what happens with
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   Every technology in europe and the
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:27.580]   Matrix for what against technology. That's a different story. They've led happens. Yeah. Yes. Yes
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.500]   And yeah, and then things but netlod failed
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.860]   This is the whole thing and people who go ultimately this will fail
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.320]   Yeah, there's no people who go get technology
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.140]   Well, it's gonna happen unless we reduce the stone age. It's gonna happen
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.420]   Yeah, but what worries me is that writing mobs don't build chip fabs
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.540]   You know, if if we're going to go through like a 20 or 30 year period of complete
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:53.820]   Anarchy then we're losing out on a big opportunity because if we just thought about it a little bit beforehand
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:56.620]   We could avoid all that and get all the benefits
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:03.820]   Ah, I like it. So who's going to do that? Let me just ha well for that. I was going to say let's let's have politicians come up with this
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.380]   Yes, so much that gonna happen. I vote for that person. Who's this person? That's some interesting
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:12.700]   You know research would you create presidents note in is it training? Is it
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:17.980]   What would you do? We already make enough food and food food to feed everybody on the planet
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:20.620]   Well, that's a mark in question mark in tradition says is hey
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:25.260]   Everything's just going to become effectively cheap or free. So it doesn't matter if you have a job
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:31.900]   Yeah, there's some I think that's a terrible I doubt about it. Yeah, I seen ronberry did that once for 50 years ago
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.780]   Yeah, was that a Star Trek episode? Well, everyone
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.740]   I think the entire society was based on no money, right people pursued either careers and leisure activities
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.620]   To satisfy their own inner inner workings
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:46.300]   Uh boy now I'm depressed
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:50.140]   Hey wait until the question of debate then you can get really depressed
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.860]   Hucking baby pandas Leo just keep thinking about hugging baby pandas. You know, it's it's really
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.340]   They even ruin cats for us now
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:01.580]   Pussycats it's really interesting. I didn't
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.100]   It's really interesting as I've traveled
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.780]   Last couple of weeks the reluctance you saw I saw it here in the states
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:16.460]   People are very reluctant to talk about the election whether you're I think mostly because you're afraid you'll get in a fistfight because you don't know
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.220]   But even when we were traveling around not
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.860]   You know in the past people have
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:27.580]   You know tour guides or people you meet on the street might have asked you about the political scene in the United States
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.980]   Nobody does anymore. They don't they don't say
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:35.420]   Are you do you who are you gonna vote who you could well? I bring it up
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.300]   What would I bring it up when I when I do talks to
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.100]   Foreign visitors when I do talks in Europe or on the world
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.740]   They're talking about Mexico especially
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.380]   And I apologize for what's happening. I get applause. It's an easy. It's the easiest applause. Yeah
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:51.580]   They want you to break the ice, but I think they are just as I am
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.940]   I'm very nervous about bringing it up at all. If you break the ice, that's different
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.660]   But they'll talk about it. Yeah
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.700]   Yeah, but I mean it's they'll you have a split marriage. No
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.740]   Not that split
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.300]   Not that split my friend
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.860]   I don't know in the you can't we have a phrase if you want polite conversation
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:13.260]   You don't bring up politics or religion and I guess it's the same or the money America money. Yeah
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:19.020]   You know, I've been I've been canvassing in Pennsylvania for the last every weekend I go over Pennsylvania now
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.660]   And this was the last weekend I could have registered
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.540]   last weekend I was in um, I think it was allen town
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:30.060]   And uh, that was yesterday. I was in eastern last weekend and I grew up to do a house
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.700]   And the address they give me and a very nice woman answers the door and she says well, I'm for trump
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:41.100]   And my husband's for for clinton. Wow, my kids are also split trump for for clinton. I said, I don't want to be your thing is giving
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.700]   I don't know what you do is you just don't you don't talk about polo. You don't go watch twit. Oh, no
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:52.060]   Yes. Yeah, and that's why we don't talk about politics here. I know I know I know we know I know we know I know
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.140]   No, it's hard not to and uh
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:00.300]   It's hard not to because it is like for the next 30 days. This is all it's gonna occupy
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.500]   Is another 30 days 30 days. Yeah
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.580]   My vice drink heavily
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:14.140]   Legitimate with tech angles galore here. Oh, there's tons of the use of twitter is is absolutely fascinating
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.540]   Let's talk about twi- I want to take a break, but let's talk about twitter because twitter had some very bad news this week
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.100]   Yeah
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.860]   I think the price might drop low enough that I could buy
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.780]   You know what if I bought twitter I would put them out of business, but we'll talk about that in a second first
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:39.020]   You know, I'm not a fan used to be used to be a fan. I used to be the person with the most followers on twitter
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:46.380]   And i'll tell you how long ago that was I was number one on twitter with 5,000 followers
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.260]   And then you went to google 5

[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:39.820]   breaking news and politics what else and I hesitate to mention this but but
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.420]   11 minutes ago trump was live on
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.780]   Facebook live with clinton accusers, you know what's great?
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.780]   I have to say one thing about donald trump is he has is a master
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.220]   Of social media an evil master at that
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.700]   Depends on how you feel about it if you like him then he's a brilliant master, but he's
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:04.380]   Mastered twitter. It's interesting to see him using facebook now
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   Yeah, it has turned around and bit more on the bum a bit because all these things that's been talking about for the last two or three years
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:16.540]   And now be there's a record against him. Yeah, you know there is a record online and he can't deny it
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:20.940]   Well, but that's the nature of the world whether you set it on camera or on tape
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:27.100]   Because why you never say anything online that you can't find you too. Well. Yeah, I mean I'm
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.740]   you know anytime we want to
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.220]   Talk about anything
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:38.380]   Uh, we do it in person not not over recorded medium or email
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.780]   If you want privacy the only way to do it is to go out in a park naked
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:46.940]   Disassemble your wireless phone. Yeah, leave your phone behind
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:53.260]   Yeah, uh and stand in the middle of a field or or a clown costume. Oh, the satellites can see you like okay
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:56.940]   This is clouds are interesting. We'll get to 20 second clouds are interesting
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.260]   So I don't think there really been that many incidents of clowns
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.100]   But because there's all these fake news sites now
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:09.340]   You cannot believe anything you read on the internet anymore
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:16.060]   Hundreds of stories about clown sightings scary clowns axes clowns grabbing children
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:22.060]   And people can't tell when they see this on facebook or twitter if it's real or not they believe it and so
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.860]   everybody in the world
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:31.580]   I was at the gym yesterday and spin class. They couldn't stop talking about clowns. I play him steven king. I see
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.900]   Yes, it is. I said just
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:39.180]   Guys, galaxy notes at them and this is not a widespread problem. These are fake news stories
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.180]   But no one knows the difference anymore
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:45.500]   I was there many many many many many many years ago. I was I was a midnight
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.900]   Um rewrite guy at the shiara tribune
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:54.780]   And there was a story of a loose kangaroo in chicago and I ended up on the bbc doing like weekly reports about this right
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.940]   And turns out that's a regular thing
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:01.820]   There are loose kangaroos supposedly in cities and they get into boxing matches with people and this is a story that goes
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.900]   It's a very snopesy thing long before snopes
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:10.860]   And clowns and it never happened there was never a kangaroo. I don't think so. No, you have alligators in your sewers, jeff
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.740]   I would have to believe all these sewers. Yeah, you have clowns in the woods
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:19.660]   The great thing about the clown story is indeed clowns do creep me and freak me out. Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.940]   All right, this is this is I there's a guy at you see berkeley. I can't remember his name
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:30.540]   jeff done done us or something who specializes in sick joke cycles
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:38.460]   He's a sociologist and his theory is that you know, and you know, there were the elephant elephant jokes
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:44.140]   Uh, there his theory is these jokes are an outlet for tabu subjects
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.980]   He says the elephant jokes, uh, actually a racist
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:53.580]   But you would say thing it would it would it would happen during the civil rights era that became very popular
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.980]   It was it was an escape valve for some deep existential angst
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.420]   People were feeling so they tell these jokes or the dead baby cycle
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:07.420]   There was all these dead baby jokes right about during rovey wade when abortion became started becoming a big topic the national
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.980]   Psyche and it was a way of diffusing these and I think the clowns there's something going on
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.180]   In the psyche that it's diffusing something guess what?
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:19.740]   Just a theory where to say clownish
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.460]   I kid the moment. Hmm our psyches are our psyches are burning right now
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.900]   You weren't you weren't here for this leo, but there was an anti-cover to story on on mac break about how this video is telling people
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.900]   They could just drill a hole in their iphone to get the headphone
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:39.660]   Nobody fell for that did anybody fall in the year before the year before you could microwave to charge it the year before that
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.220]   You could throw it in a sink and but really did anybody drill a hole in their iphone?
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:47.100]   No, nobody knows because the comments could be as fake as a videos
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.300]   Yeah, I would be shocked
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:58.300]   Well, I wouldn't be but I'm used to dealing with humans jupy-dice and it's just how stupid do you have to be to drill a hole in your iphone?
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:04.780]   Seriously, it lost the pressure out. Nobody did that. That's like clowns in the woods
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.940]   I think it's just an urban legend. I think
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.900]   Yeah, anyway, twitter so twitter's for sale, right? We agree that twitter's for sale
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.620]   It's option b. I'm be apparently there's been a battle in the border
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.980]   We got to get nick built in here because he's the only guy who really knows what's going down at twitter
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   But there's a battle in the boardroom jeff
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.340]   Um jack dorsey does not want to sell twitter. He wants to continue to be ceo ev williams
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:32.220]   One of its founders says yeah, it's time. We got to sell this thing before it all collapses in on us
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.300]   But it's nothing likes to sell. Yeah
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:39.420]   This so that started the rumors to produce talk price went up right because well that could be good
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.180]   Hello em said it publicly
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:46.300]   Right and then publicly they got a look at options google says yeah, no
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.540]   And and um who else micro subs is disney
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.380]   Well, the big one was yeah
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:57.900]   Apple says yeah, no the big one then that stock really went up Disney. Yeah, Disney says yeah, no
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:03.740]   We were kind of a competition in the office as to who's gonna be saying no next time bernie sonders says he went by twitter next as well
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.260]   So salesforce is the last man standing mark may not happen
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:12.060]   But apparently all of the uh all of the shareholders are running to mark saying what are you crazy?
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.020]   Yeah
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.660]   And you can't I mean you can kind of chatter it's good enough
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.300]   You can kind of ignore the shareholders, but not really
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.420]   And apparently the institutional shareholders including fidelity which has double digit
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.820]   percentage of
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.020]   uh stock in salesforce is saying yeah, no mark no
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.780]   This is a perfect match for google's jikou purchase leo. I mean they could just make one awesome
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.100]   so uh
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.460]   Is so now twitter's tanking yeah in the stock market
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:42.700]   Well, i'm sorry they try to build never been more relevant in terms of popular culture
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:48.140]   Well, this is twitter in a nutshell at the same time as it's horrific and horrible and disgusting
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:50.300]   It's also unbelievably fascinating
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:54.940]   And i'm changing the world you know, are you after the debate?
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.100]   Here i am in the middle of nowhere
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.700]   I got no connection to anything, but i'm able to scan twitter
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:08.380]   Yeah to see what people are saying it's it's really the best way to kind of if you own the role data feed of what's going on
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.940]   Yeah, well i question how good it is because
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.660]   At most there's 300 million users
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:20.780]   Probably more than half of those probably only a hundred million are real people and only half of that really are active
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.180]   So it's a tiny sample
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.580]   But it's a fascinating say it's every
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.300]   It's an incredibly engaged sampling. Yeah, and it's interesting people's journalists and yeah
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:37.020]   Psychos, but at the same time politicians politicians, but you've got to the economic realities can't be ignored
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.540]   It has never made a profit it will never make a profit in its current format
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:46.140]   The only value that it has is in the data that's collected about its users and that's not worth 30 billion
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.300]   No, it's not where we're yeah, no
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.460]   Even at a discounted price they were talking. What was it?
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.380]   $42 per user
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:55.500]   Yeah, uh, which is a fraction of what facebook is worth per user
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:24:02.060]   Exactly it's still not worth it and facebook has so much more useful stuff on uses google's probably the only company that could actually use twitter's
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.780]   Information they would sort of be like a custodian
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:07.580]   They would buy it like as a foster child and sort of put it in one wing
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:15.420]   But the brand damage to them that's the problem then every mucky thing that said that's the real problem for nobody wants to own
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.540]   Your up. Yeah, nobody wants to own twitter because nobody wants the twitter's stank to rub off on them
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:23.260]   Nobody wants the unedited voice of the people
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:30.380]   Or at least I don't know it's it is particularly good at pulling out the worst of the worst of a lot of people as well
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:34.620]   I don't think it's it's an accurate sampling of us because it's there's some pretty bad humanity on there
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:40.780]   By the way, john ledger has just tweeted that t-mobile is suspending sales of sam's songs galaxy note seven
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:47.100]   Yep, all sales suspended out of a buttonings of caution. Yeah. Well joining verizon
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:51.820]   AT&T bye bye. They've got to do a full chipotle. Yeah
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.220]   Full chipotle
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:57.020]   I'm still not
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.300]   Full on time for the full chipotle
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:07.660]   So whether twitter now I look at okay, so forchan's struggling right forchan the original meme factory
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:12.220]   Pooh pool sold it chris pool sold it
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:20.460]   No, no, pardon me. No, I'm for how much the can't have been much moot never made any money on it
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:25.180]   Sold it now the guy who owns it saying we're not met we're losing our shirt here
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:30.060]   We're running out of money because nobody wants an ad on forchan. Oh, no
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:34.460]   Um, well, okay. Nobody's selling anything legal. What's that on that?
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.980]   Is is I feel like twitter and reddit are
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:43.820]   Are the next dominoes to fall in this and here's the common thread anonymity?
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:49.660]   Yes, what we've learned is that while aminity anonymity has some good reasons for it
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.260]   It also allows the worst of us
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:58.540]   What was that famous joke right anonymity plus internet access plus broadcast equals the you know
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.740]   Either with ego is a penny arcade did that famous cartoon? Yeah, yeah, and I agree we should have anonymity
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.780]   But i'm rethinking this idea. I think you know part of it was I had this
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:13.820]   Utopian notion that the internet true democracy would give everybody a voice and that could only be for the good
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:18.860]   And then I found out that a very very tiny percentage of people are horrible
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:24.940]   And and the problem is their voice is amplified to the point where what's that book say?
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.820]   I'm buying books now about
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:34.300]   Civilibility is you know, I hate to admit it, but maybe Andrew king was right and raking remember
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.140]   Oh god, please he wrote the book the cult of the amateurs
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:45.100]   He was arguing that there is a reason why the elites run things. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:50.940]   I think it's because he's arguing in the defense of elites and institutions, right and
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:55.740]   I'm starting to think he's not far wrong. No, no, no, no problem is this Leo
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:02.540]   So all right pardon me drinking game time. I happen to have a plus point right here. Thank you. So from Gutenberg pardon me
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:09.260]   On right, uh, I I had a right of peace recently about martin looser
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:18.140]   And and and and if we're in the year 1450 was depressed 1475 is where we are now versus the web right martin looser was born in 1483
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.180]   And he didn't start publishing till about 1505
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.540]   We're we are martin looser isn't even born yet
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:31.740]   So it's too soon to say oh forget all the future. Let's hold on to the old institutions. Let's keep the aristocracy
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.580]   No
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:38.380]   Right, but we haven't we haven't created the rule replacements in the air of spring. We tore down. We didn't build up
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.380]   Right, donald trump of the republican party. They tore down. They haven't built up. Right. This is the era of tearing down
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:49.420]   Um, now martin looser did start a new t torn down the catholic church. We'd build a new church
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:53.980]   And and and we're not yet at that stage where we're building what's new
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.860]   So I do think there is a there is a call to civility
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.900]   There is a call to rethinking the notion of building civilization on the net
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.180]   But that does not mean that we kill the future and retain the past that ain't working
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.540]   So elitism is part of the past that you do want to discard
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.740]   Well, that's what that's what I mean the great paradox of trump
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.500]   I'm not going to implode it. Well, don't worry
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.260]   But here's a guy with gold toilets whose entire appeal is
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.660]   Down with the elites. What if I say instead of elites meritocracy
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:27.980]   No, that I think that's wrong because because merit's not a bad thing people aren't against true merit
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.780]   I don't think well, that's what unearned merit born merit. Oh, I agree I agree with you
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.500]   But highly I can't murder friend next to you
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.860]   Hey, he's got a posh accent
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:44.860]   Social mobility in this country is worse than it is in the UK at the moment. Really? That's how big a problem you've got
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:47.900]   Yeah, really the entrenchment of certain. I think he is right
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:52.460]   It's the last for the last five or six years long to school of economics has been doing a study on this
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.980]   It's worse over here. And I never thought I'd see that's one of the reasons
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.340]   The rejection of science with america is appalling
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.820]   But I think we were at a point where we're not mature enough to be able to have civilization and anonymity at the same time
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:07.420]   Because we quickly when you're anonymous you quickly forget about the repercussions of your actions
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.620]   You're almost drunk. Uh, you know, you're power crazy on the anonymity
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:14.940]   You think suddenly all your all your darker angels can come out and play without any fear of repercussion
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.980]   So we I think anonymity definitely has value like you said
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:23.020]   But when you get a lot of people together into groups, we have not shown the responsibility needed for it
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:28.220]   So here's the big question. I always wonder is is does openness necessarily breed trolls?
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:32.060]   Is there an opportunity to have openness in a way that can be civil?
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.860]   Do you equate openness with anonymity?
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:37.660]   I think anonymity breeds trolls
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:41.020]   No, I disagree because I can name plenty of a holes by name
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:46.780]   Yeah, okay, maybe I mean, um, but at least anonymity is not it
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:51.580]   No, I think I think that openness allows anyone to do anything and you know, I celebrate that as a rule
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:54.300]   uh, but, um
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:30:00.860]   How to look at their kids are equal and opera set like equal opposite people who are just so pious that their jerks as well
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.660]   I think there's probably both ends. We just don't see it as much
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.900]   Yeah, the other the other thing is the freedom of speech is also the freedom to edit
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:15.580]   And and this is where people and I think facebook has done some really boneheaded things like killing the the napalm photo
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.900]   Not really isn't the pornography of that photo was not
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:23.340]   Yeah, but they that was that was a mechanical thing that they reversed right? That was boneheaded, right?
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:27.020]   Yeah, but it was mechanical and they reversed but it was still they're right at some level
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:31.500]   It is they're right to decide what doesn't does not go on their platform. I'm sure you have that
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.740]   Yes, and that is that is a that is a mode of freedom of speech too
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:40.860]   So that you know, you can be fortunate and anything goes you can be read it and and almost anything goes
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:45.020]   And those are places where you can go and do that but if you're facebook or twitter
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:51.820]   Do you choose not to be that now facebook chooses not to be that you're right leo because of identity enable it enables that process
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:57.660]   But it's not there's plenty of jerks on on facebook. I don't know that rises to the same level though. Does it?
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.500]   It's an aid, but it's not a solution
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:08.540]   I feel like facebook and originally google plus because of their real names policy has a as really avoided a lot of the
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.900]   Twitter is user control
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:12.380]   Oh, man
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:16.700]   And twitter also, I think the frustration was that they they didn't do things when it seemed like they could like for example
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.260]   You could give people absolute freedom of speech in their own timeline
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:23.740]   But the minute they put an at mention in it not have that same level of freedom because now you're involving other people
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.140]   And it just looked like they're probably seven or eight different solutions
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.140]   And it looked like they implemented none of them and I think that's where the they're like you can you can argue that
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:33.740]   So okay assuming there is a technological solution
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.980]   to twitter's
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.700]   Pollution problem. I'll call it a pollution problem, right?
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.820]   You've got a stream with some really great stuff, but there's chunks floating in it and we'd like to get the chunks out
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.500]   Assuming there is a solution who should buy twitter?
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.900]   It's a molly gark
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.140]   Yeah
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.140]   Donald Trump was not the twitter just now
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:57.260]   Uh kind of make sure it and said that Donald Trump buys twitter
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:04.220]   He needs it he can't afford it. I mean, I think that's the oh by the time by the time all this is done he may be able to
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:08.940]   Yeah, um, I didn't see this is certainly not a brand not Leo not a brand that kid
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.020]   That's why Disney never made sense. Now Disney has to keep a clean image ultimately
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.780]   Never and frankly, so does apple and google
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.740]   Yep, I think what's gonna happen is some
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:23.580]   Hedge fund or private equity group will buy out twitter
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.900]   Think we can make a profit out of this
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:31.020]   Futs about with the actual format of the platform and kill it by that's the ones who bought palm
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.380]   Right is ultimate or gruesome the same people bought palm can buy twitter. Yeah
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:39.580]   Yeah, but we don't have matching Leo to running put running hp to in the same way that we had with palm there
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:45.020]   You know, I mean the project people with enough money to buy it now. I think it's gonna be private equity and hedge fund crowds
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.860]   That actually makes sense
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:51.820]   Uh, and they're they've got the hubris to think they can fix it exactly if I were one of those guys the first thing though
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:55.500]   I would do is canvas the smartest minds at what is the
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:59.100]   Solution what is the fix? What is the filtration system?
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:04.540]   And and how would it work and could we implement that because you could polish this turd
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:08.620]   And turn it into something of great value. I mean, there's no i'm not disagreeing
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:12.940]   There's huge value in twitter. Yeah, I mean, it's it's an iconic brand and a lot of people
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:17.020]   Not just the brand the actual content. Well, yeah, but I mean people people actually love it
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:19.100]   They use it on a regular basis. That's fine
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:25.340]   But it's making money out of it and they're now to try and make money out of it. They can't do it
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:30.460]   I think you're right again. So so but but you're both right because Leo saying there's an insight here
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:37.340]   Which which you know with ev has always had blogger was an insight that changed the world blogger itself was never a good business
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:40.060]   twitter was inside the change the world never good business
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:45.740]   But so let's say the twitter gets bought by hedge fund and ruined or gets bought by uh, verizon and gets ruined
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:51.500]   But where does that insight go if you're going to build something new knowing what we know about twitter. What would you build? That's interesting
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:56.780]   People with no anonymity leave anonymity to the other guys
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.180]   And anonymity is troubling
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.660]   It's always a hard to say it's true layers that there's a truly verified layer
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:08.860]   Uh that has google plus like control and yeah, there may be a crap layer
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:11.500]   It's moving in that direction, right? And then you'd have
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.860]   Yeah, but they yeah exactly yeah
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.420]   I don't know. I think there is a role for anonymity in that it gives people a way that they can speak out
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:24.780]   And the the initial idea behind it was good in that you judge people based on what they had said
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:28.060]   In the past and you made your judgments about their personality that way
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.500]   But it's broken down for multiple reasons
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:37.340]   Chiefy that you make as many anonymous accounts as you like and be as nasty as you like and I should point out by the way that we have a very
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:41.900]   Wonderful chat room. Yeah that embraces anonymity
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:48.460]   Uh that you can use a handle you are totally anonymous in there and the reason it works is we have
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:54.380]   Constant moderation and cultivation and we pay attention to it
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.740]   And that's true of any anonymous same thing with forums
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:02.380]   You know every forums gone through that period of if you ignore it the weeds grow and pretty soon
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.820]   Nobody wants to be there and then that's dozens and dozens of moderators in our forums
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:11.180]   Moderation though. Yeah, the solution. I obviously twitter can't do that. Yeah, no, we moderate our own forums
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.180]   I mean, it's just like yeah, it's
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:17.820]   You need to have someone in there saying no that's stupid don't do it
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.780]   And it's not as simple as it's not as simple as just kicking people out
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.260]   It's actually working with people cultivating people on baking a part of the community educating them
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:30.380]   To value it to the communication platform. So just breaking news in two fronts. Oh, oh now what?
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.940]   Uh number one billy bush just got suspended
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:36.700]   Good. I don't think you should have come to work tomorrow. I and number two
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:41.100]   Zuckerberg is still grilling. He now has friends with them. They're smoke rising
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.060]   Gonna go back to it
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.620]   Gonna be this way
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.860]   John's 100 or 2000
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:51.340]   Uh followers right now why
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:55.180]   Is he gonna program the debates are they gonna people have to choose between soccer
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:59.420]   barbecue and the debates. Oh, that's interesting. Or what about watching with mark
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.860]   Would be good. Yeah
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:07.260]   Um, you know, I've been drinking some anchor steam recently. Yeah, I get local beer
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:12.940]   Race. All right. Well, there you go. Now. I know I think that's probably where I think I saw Sam less than in the photo a bit ago
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.580]   Is that Sam?

[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.620]   We just know that's not I'm the meat chef
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.980]   Priscilla is mid brussel sprouts and broccoli

[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:55.180]   Somebody to not realize this the cameras turned on somebody who's wankered on too many anchor steams
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:37:02.620]   Someone behind that fence. What are the neighbors doing right now? Are they peeking over there? No, no, no, he bought the neighborhood remember? Oh, that's right. Yeah
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.660]   That fence is purely
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.340]   Aesthetic. It's a Hollywood. Yeah, Hollywood fence
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.140]   Um, wow
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.700]   123,000 people
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.660]   Watching wanes world basically
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:27.420]   It makes me sad that I built this studio that I did I mean this is crazy talk parion's uh party on zuck party on
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.980]   I wonder if it's a
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:32.700]   Mepo camera
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.700]   Uh, look. Oh, he's got uh, he's got
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:40.300]   Emotional symbols floating or there maybe it's only when it's little that you get that
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:45.020]   They're emotional, you know, the little uh, there's some angry faces. Oh, oh
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   It's over
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.980]   Don't be don't be sad that it's over
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:53.420]   Be happy that it happened ladies. Yeah, celebrate that it existed
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:59.420]   But you got to be part of that brief moment in history. I you know, I'm just glad I wasn't here all week
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:06.060]   I don't know what happened, but fortunately they've created a small movie to dramatize the events of last week at twit
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.060]   Let's all watch together
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:13.260]   Onto it. This is the first uh gears of war for the xbox one console
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:18.220]   If you have an xbox one and you want a good online shooter cool if you've got a windows 10 pc
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:21.660]   That's pretty powerful definitely get this yeah, but it's not a vr
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:24.460]   so I mean
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:29.820]   To it live specials hello, everyone. I'm Jason. Howl, and I'm here at oculus connect three
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:35.900]   Larsley this event feels like a coming out party for the oculus touch controller to really showcase
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.980]   How much that can enhance these experiences and move into the next dimension
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:44.940]   All about android today marked the big event in san francisco where google
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.500]   Uh made many announcements of new hardware
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.340]   But one of the most important things that came out of it I think was their new marketing strategy
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:57.020]   Around the term made by google, but they made it very very clear that like the pixel phones which we'll talk about as well
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.580]   The other items were designed by google
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:05.740]   I've wanted an iPhone that runs android forever and today I have one wow that's an interesting thing about you jerry
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:12.220]   The new screen savers the playstation vr it comes out next week. This is bizarre, but it's yeah

[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:20.940]   The freezer was under this table so I couldn't get to it. So I just I just defaced the whole

[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:52.860]   How the river thing versus the other thing about the river thing is it doesn't rock
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:58.220]   Uh the emotion of the ocean is unpredictable and we had a couple of rocky days don't bother me
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.300]   But uh, they don't bother me, but uh
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.620]   If they bother you you probably shouldn't go on a cruise
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:09.420]   And uh, and then uh the other thing about riverboats is they're slu and pretty much everywhere they go you're in town
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:15.820]   Uh cruise you're uh you could be out of town. Although this was a small enough ship that we were in really good locations everywhere
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:18.380]   It was pretty fun. It looks fantastic. It was yeah
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:22.060]   Had a good had a great time vacation. You were a spiffy dresser leo
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.460]   You like the pink poncho is that when you talk?
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:26.940]   Like no like the talks the suits the talks is I mean
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:34.540]   Hey, you know when you're a living the life of royally you've got to dress the board. It was almost an Ian Fleming novel
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:37.420]   Bald
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:43.980]   Uh also uh from uh the register register.co. You came my good friend Ian Thompson always great to have you here

[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.820]   Richie let's talk about yahoo next okay
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.340]   Okay fire fire up your yahoo
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.900]   But i don't know if it's stand the tragedy of the pathos so sad isn't it?
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:02.300]   I feel like twitter's moving in that way too kind of we had to write an article about how to get off yahoo
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.860]   Because you can't just delete your account. We had to write how to delete all the
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.860]   I have that question as a matter of fact good. All right. I want to talk about it
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:14.780]   I was here. I am on a boat with very little intimate activity desperately trying to delete my yahoo account quick
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:19.420]   Uh, I decided not to I turned on two factor authentication. I figured that'd be enough
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:23.100]   For me years ago. I'm glad they hadn't used it for a while. They killed the cat
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.700]   Yeah, remember that about that, but no, I'm happy. Yeah, it was Steve Gibson actually made me
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:32.380]   Kind of nervous about it because he was saying like you forget like these are digital artifacts and you forget what's tied to your yahoo account
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:36.140]   I want recovery emails. It's used for and what data is in all the email
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:39.260]   You've got accumulated there in terms of other accounts and other access points
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.380]   And I stopped to think about and I said it's just I just did exactly what he said
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:45.020]   I made a pseudo random blob and I did not save it to one password
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.580]   And it's just it's empty now and I'm not getting back into it
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.700]   Yeah, we did we did a quick pull around the office and they're like six of us there
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:55.420]   Everyone had a you yahoo account only two people had actually used it for anything in the last year
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:44:00.220]   But when you think you're right when you think about what's actually on there from all the years past
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:05.980]   It's kind of scary stuff and yahoo really have screwed the pooch on this one and very bad way
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:07.980]   We'll explain
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:13.100]   In moments, but first a word from audible.com one thing I did bring and I will always bring anytime
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.420]   I'm on a long plane flight or a cruise. I bring books, but I don't bring
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:21.500]   stacks of paper of dead trees. I don't even bring a Kindle
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:26.220]   I bring my audio books because I have it the audible app on all my devices
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.740]   And I brought 12 audio books and I ended up buying another one
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.540]   Because we were in russia and right about
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:36.700]   When we were in russia, I started hearing about this new book about the romanovs
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.780]   Oh, what a story that is
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.420]   300 years of crazy
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:46.300]   It makes you feel a lot better about modern times when you realize how crazy it was
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.380]   In the old days, I'll tell you about that in a second
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:53.020]   But let me first tell you about how you can get it for free at audible.com

[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:15.420]   From audible that I wanted to re listen to so go to audible.com/twit2 the romanoff's
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.900]   great book
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.740]   started of course
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:24.940]   in the 1613 I think it was when the first romanoff czar of russian ended with
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:30.540]   Nicholas czar Nicholas who's had had you know was killed by the emulsion Vix this is it
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:37.900]   What a great story 1613 to 1918 and when you listen though, it does make you feel a little bit better about modern times as bad as it is
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:41.180]   At least we haven't
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:44.060]   There has been some progress
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:53.100]   Uh, it's a great. I it is fascinating book and a really a lot of uh people are celebrating it as a as a great history of the
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.020]   russian czars
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:59.980]   Uh, you could get that book and something else audible.com/twit2 two books
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:03.740]   Waiting for you for free get them get them
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:12.300]   Uh, yahoo. Oh my god. Now it's gotten so bad that verizon has said can we get a billion dollars back?
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:17.820]   Yeah a billion dollars back because we are buying damaged goods. So
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:23.980]   First there was the breach the book. Yeah, that's the first thing that every was hundreds of millions accounts, right?
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:27.500]   500 million by some accounts the biggest breach of data ever
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:33.420]   Uh, I did not get to hear security now where the I presume this stuff was hashed at least
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:38.300]   Passwords were hashed and some security questions were hashed but only some of them
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:42.780]   Although I think state was explaining that they would migrate you to a better hash if you re logged in
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:48.220]   But many people never re logged in so they were stuck on the old hash. We're not very and we caches are easily broken. Yeah
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.460]   Yeah, in fact if you have a bad password even good hashes are easily broken
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:57.100]   500 million accounts. So that was the first thing I was aware how long
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:00.380]   That in the fact that we didn't know yeah, it was too
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:05.340]   They didn't know for how long and then we didn't know for how long right at least for at least four years
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.540]   Um, so if you ever had a yahoo account ever you're screwed
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:14.540]   Which includes like flicker because people don't think about it. But flicker is yeah, right?
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:19.980]   Uh, by the way a yahoo knew about an august. Yep didn't say anything well. Hey, well first
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:23.660]   How why did it take so long for yahoo to know that it existed?
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.020]   Is that is that is that they have legitimate excuse for that?
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:32.140]   It sounded like they're they didn't care about security at a very deep corporate level like people brought it up to them internally and they were
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:34.380]   It was told it was not a priority to them. Yeah
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:39.580]   Unless they were doing it on behalf of the of the nsa and the cia and the fbi but that's another story
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:45.100]   Some some yahoo staffers actually did go to New York New York times over this and they were within the company
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.100]   They were known as the paranoid
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.740]   and apparently alex stammoth who was hired as
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:55.740]   CSO went head-to-head with mayor on this one stammus is smart and good and I like alex
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.140]   And that's why and the reason he left is apparently because they weren't taking security seriously
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:05.740]   And then the news about the hook up with the intelligence agencies came in and that looks even more like well
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:11.900]   Let's stick with this breach because yahoo at least knew about in august and failed to inform verizon
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:19.420]   Until a couple of weeks ago long after the sale so they so they're in deep doodoo because you can be complicit and incompetent
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.500]   It's important to realize that you both things. Yes
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:29.340]   They I mean they had a responsibility to disclose this to the potential buyers. They did not that doodoo has a dollar for your attention
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:33.740]   Significant maybe a billion dollars at least that's what verizon wants back. They could well queer the whole sale
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:41.660]   I mean verizon aren't my my read talking to people at verizon is that a lot of people at verizon aren't that keen on this in the first place
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:46.780]   And this could give them an ideal get out. Yeah, absolutely. They absolutely could walk away at this point either way
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:50.460]   Verizon gets a better deal. Yeah, it gets out or gets out a hell of a lot cheaper
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:54.700]   I don't know what the fee for abandoning the deal is it's probably significant
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:58.060]   Oh unless there's cause but if there's cause that might go away
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.100]   Get out of jail free card. Wow. Oh, yeah
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.060]   when that I mean
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:09.820]   Brand value especially now when when when when giving over data to third party because when you when you transfer a company
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.060]   You have to transfer all the personal data to what is basically a third party that is the purchaser
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:19.100]   And that's always a big issue as is and now all that data is suspect
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:23.500]   Uh or has about it read that suspect it has about it now
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.380]   these kudos of
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:30.220]   Very disappointing. It's apparently
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:35.980]   Merse and my are new about it. Yeah, that's extremely disappointing
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:42.300]   It's it's I mean it is as you say it's a combination of getting competence and whatever else
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:46.540]   But I mean it's isn't malfeasance would be the word. Well, well, yeah
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:49.180]   You can't do it
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:55.180]   That is important and we've seen other companies react to these sorts of things and you did this is just again an abysmal reaction
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.780]   And that you can't walk away from something bad happens. You do the best thing possible
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.220]   You treat your customers great you try to solve the problem people sort of respect that
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:07.260]   But if something bad happens and you make it worse than that the damage is extreme. Yeah
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.540]   then
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:17.980]   A week later we find out that yahoo complied with the federal request. Oh, did molding comply? Well, it gets work
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:25.180]   It's gonna get worse. So the apparently the and this was approved by the secret court the FISA court
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:30.060]   But but it probably shouldn't have been because it was clearly a fishing expedition
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:40.060]   Apparently yahoo went through all yahoo mail. It looks like looking for a signature for a malefactor that the that the feds wanted
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:47.100]   Um now of course when you get one of these letters you can't tell anybody about it and you pretty much have to comply
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:51.180]   Although many companies including twitter and facebook and apple have fought these
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:55.980]   Uh as hard as they can does there's no evidence that yahoo fought it further for the past
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:02.140]   They had the past yeah the past they fought against the international security letters and they lost and it looks at this point
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:06.700]   Like they got another one of these things. Oh, let's just get it done a lot of money fighting these and they said yeah
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:09.820]   Instead of opening the command. Oh, let's just take it off. We're gonna live in my trouble
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.900]   We're gonna lose why battle
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:17.180]   But then they made it then this is unclear, but the so Reuters had these original story
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:20.780]   But now there's further evidence that initially we thought oh
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:24.940]   They just modified a spam filter to do a little bit more straining. No
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:28.380]   Apparently they wrote something akin to a rootkit
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:34.140]   Now i'm unclear on this did steve talk about this on tuesday. I don't know I don't recall
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:39.900]   I think not because uh this broke afterwards, so we'll talk about it on security now tuesday
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:42.380]   Um, that's fascinating the thing
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:48.700]   At the moment there's only one person who knows the truth of this and that's how like stamos and he's not talking
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.420]   Yeah, and i've probably very good legal reasons because i'm presuming he got a gagging clause the second he left yahoo
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:59.420]   But he is the only person at this point in time who can tell us exactly what happened because he was in charge of the servers
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:04.620]   When this apparently took place so until we hear from him everything else is speculation at the moment
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:07.180]   according to mother board
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.980]   yahoo
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:14.140]   Engineers didn't merely modify spam
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:18.940]   They built a tool installed a root kit on yahoo's mail servers
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.980]   Without telling anybody stamos and a security team found it and thought they'd been hacked
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:28.460]   Yeah, and then we're told no no no no no no no that's us we did that on purpose
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:32.700]   And it was buggy and poorly designed and as a result exposed
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.740]   300 million yahoo users themselves
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.300]   to hacking
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.580]   I mean that's what google and apple tell you they will never code against their own code
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:46.620]   Their own base because you expose it too far more than just the people who legally want an access point to it now
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.620]   We should say these are anonymous sources
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:54.060]   Supposedly former yahoo employees who told mother board this so this is unconfirmed at this point, but
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.620]   uh, that is that is
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:54:00.620]   It was interesting because when we got in contact with google and facebook and they both said exactly the same thing
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:04.460]   Hell no, there's no way we would do this even if we were instructed to by the government
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:07.980]   Now they've got deeper pockets than yahoo and they could probably afford to fight it
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:15.820]   But this is just death via who's brand. I mean bad enough lose half of it half a billion email accounts what brand well
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:17.900]   Okay, it's still had some
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:23.420]   You know you hear that you hear that from rank and file to like people at apple or google will tell you that they would rather quit and ever do this sort of thing
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:28.460]   Yes, just it's yeah, it's well all you have to do is find one guy who says oh, that's an interesting challenge. I'll write that
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:36.780]   Uh, maybe not so could a programmer as it turns out, but anyway, it was apparently done and according to mother board
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:41.820]   Uh, this software would give the nsa or the fbi whoever requested this
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:49.180]   Effectively unlimited undetectable access to get this all yahoo users data
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:52.300]   Well, not just email anything everything
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:56.620]   Yeah, thank you
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.180]   Still you know who they really want the yahoo from
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:05.500]   Sorry, I didn't know I was just saying like you don't you don't really hear the tech aficionados using yahoo
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.700]   You know that much anymore. So I wonder who's you know how helpful is this data?
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:13.340]   But as you point out everybody had a yahoo account. Yeah, absolutely. No. Yeah, very true
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.940]   And also it's not such you know, it's it's older users, but older users sometimes have power
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.260]   Who is the was it john brennan?
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.540]   Who was found to have an aol account that he was still using?
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.700]   Yeah, I still I have somebody the last week around yahoo accounts like i believe it
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:32.300]   Well, and we're some of the phishing attack like they used when they use the security words
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:36.060]   They got off Wikipedia to hack into politicians email and yahoo and aol and services like that
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:41.100]   And this may also explain why uh, there's you know, if you're gonna get phished
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.900]   Uh, it's gonna be because you had a yahoo mail account
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:49.420]   It is the it was always been the worst for security, right? And I never could quite understand how well, maybe now we know
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:54.060]   Um, let me ask you this rene. How do you delete your yahoo account? There's no button
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:59.660]   So you yeah, there's no but which is you know again appalling in this day and age because you want you want to give people the ultimate control over their data
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:04.460]   Uh, but what you can do is you can go in and again. I'm cribbing this from steve so correct me steve i've got anything wrong
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:08.380]   Uh, you go in and you just delete everything you just burn it all down you delete all the mail
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:12.300]   If you really care about it, you can download it to an offline service that you run on your own, you know
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.180]   Theoretically completely sealed computer system at home
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:18.540]   Uh, but then you just delete what's on flake you delete what's on yahoo mail
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.140]   You delete anything else that you have there
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:26.140]   And then you just change the password to some big pseudo random blob that you don't write down anywhere and that'll keep you from accessing
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:29.020]   That account again and anybody else like 64 pseudo random
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:31.980]   Or 32 pseudo random characters you'll be safe for years to come
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:34.940]   Theoretically wow
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:36.700]   Wow. Wow. Wow
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.860]   Maybe there is no security beyond the grave
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:48.620]   Before brusamire but long back yahoo is the company that gave information to the chinese government the man who spent 10 years in
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:53.100]   Right. Yes, present because of it. Yeah, this is this was their heritage. This was known they got a lot of
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:56.940]   rightful crap for that and then even after that
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:01.500]   This company allowed this that's what that's what's doubly shocking to me very sad
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:07.660]   Uh, well there you have it. Um, it's gonna be an interesting security now on tuesday. Let's put it that way. Yeah
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.780]   Hey, thank you guys. What a great show
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:13.660]   Kind of I feel like we kind of cobbled it together
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:17.260]   Yeah, we knew we're gonna have the so we're merely cobbles here
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.900]   No
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:23.820]   Nobody had a no
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.460]   All here, no, I like to be honest
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:32.220]   But I think that spontaneous twits are often the best twits and I'm and of course it just happens that some of our best
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:38.780]   I always love being at the big table on Thanksgiving. Yeah, like why there you go. That's a good way to think of it
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.940]   It's Canadian Thanksgiving, so it's a half a big day
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:44.780]   Thank you very polite
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:49.660]   It's very polite. Thank you for the good sense of humor. Thank you for taking some time on your Thanksgiving eve for renay
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.740]   We knew we could get renay because he's always working
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:56.540]   Uh those hundred thousand word reviews don't write themselves. What are you working on right now?
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:02.860]   Uh, we're we're actually doing a little bit of uh, we did all the iphone reviews all the apple watch reviews
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:09.020]   So now we're finishing the how-tos because iOS 10 and watch OS 3 and tv OS 10 and macOS Sierra all landed at the same time
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:14.620]   So we had to rewrite so many things that they're we have a fantastic team now, but we're still slogging away through all that
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.340]   I uh, I just found my iMac my two 2012 iMac died
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:24.540]   And thanks to Glenn who's visiting from australia he found out and actually was a scooter x
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.020]   Found out that there was a recall
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:32.460]   Nice on the three terabyte fusion drives in those 2012 iMacs. I happen to have
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.860]   One of them and that's apparently that's what happened. It just died while I was gone
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.980]   So uh, there's always something going on
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:44.700]   In the world technology barely works at the best of times leo Renee will be back on
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.840]   Tuesday for a great mac break weekly. I look forward to that
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:51.960]   While mark soccer berg's video has ended I guess
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:55.240]   It's time to eat the meat
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:57.080]   Uh
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.880]   Now that's i would have like lost more than a thousand people who i watched
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.200]   I really wanted to see mark after about five beers
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:05.480]   I know he could be gonna just unlike uh
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:10.120]   With my masterpiece theater for the debates he could just sit there with no loose mark would be great to see
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.720]   Yeah
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.120]   And maybe like elvis you could shoot the tv at the end of the
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:15.720]   You
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:19.640]   Jeff Jarvis city university in york cuny he's a professor of journalism there my god
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.000]   If you could study journalism with jeff javis wouldn't you want to?
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.720]   Buzz machine.com's his blog he's written all the greatest books including what would google do public parts guten berg the geek
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:36.760]   You could find it uh him at jeff javis on twitter and every wednesday right here with this week in google. Thank you
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:39.400]   Thank you. Enjoy your debate
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:43.400]   How do you how do you how will you be watching?
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:49.960]   With twitter running in the background. Oh, absolutely. I'll be well between the whole time. Oh, you'll be tweeting good
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.920]   I'll be free. I'll be following and uh, then I have obviously some specific lists
[01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:00.360]   Including fellow hillary fans what I want is all the most snarky
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:05.640]   You know and you also want the jiff makers right the animated jiff makers
