[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   This is Twix, this weekend tech, episode 67 for September 3, 2006.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Yackity Sats!
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Visa.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Safer, better money.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Life takes Visa.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Couple of days off, but that doesn't, a couple of weeks off.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Couple of twits off, but that doesn't mean we're not back ready and we're ready to go.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Now that fall is here, it is our Labor Day edition of This Week in Tech,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   sitting around the virtual tech table, John C. Devorak.org/blog
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   who was on vacation in Port Angeles.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Oh, is that a secret? His secret location?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   You know, it's, yeah, it's a big secret.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Well, that's the end of it.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Everybody's going to go there.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Also here, Robert Herron from DL.TV, who is apparently not,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and has nowhere better to be on a Labor Day weekend.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Oh, I'm killing a couple hours,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   waiting to go to a friend's birthday party or something.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Happy birthday, my wife's boyfriend.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Yeah, that's a good time to be born.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Telling you. And from Great Britain, where they have no Labor Day,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   unless you celebrate it on May Day, like the rest of the Communist world,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   it's Will Harris.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I don't know what all this crazy, all this crazy holiday about,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   where it's a Sunday and then we're working.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yeah, that's the truth of it.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Will is, of course, with BitTech, bit-tech.net.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And we're going to talk a little bit about your review of the new XBS,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   first time anywhere.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We're also awaiting the arrival of the Queen,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   aka Patrick Norton.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Now I'm in trouble.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Boy, you are.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I mean, I know around the office they call him the Queen,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   but that's never been that meant.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Never been like that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   No.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's the high-pitch voice.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's the manly calves of Patrick Norton.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   He said he might come up, which would be kind of fun if he showed up in person,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   because then you could actually hear the beating on the show.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   As it were.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Which would be nice.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So we'll get to our first stories in just a bit,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   but first I want to say that there's a big change in the wind here.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   This week in tech.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   From day one, we said we wouldn't take any advertising,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   because I had some crazy kind of utopian notion
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   that somehow we could do this without any money.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   This has proven to be a false notion.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So we welcome our first advertiser ever on this week in tech,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and you've probably heard it when you heard the beginning.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   We've got Visa online, and a Visa wanted to be on this week in tech
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   because they wanted to kind of spread the word about security,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   about how to protect yourself with a credit card.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Of course, I always, and I'm sure you do too, when you buy online,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   you buy with your Visa card because you're protected by multiple layers of Visa security,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   including continuous monitoring.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   In addition to other fraud monitoring tools,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   actually monitor all the transactions using pretty sophisticated computer analysis.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Looking for fraudulent activities, things that are happening outside of the card holder's
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   typical purchase pattern that allows them to spot activity
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   as soon as it happens and acts as an early warning system to identify a fraudulent activity.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Safer, better money.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Life takes Visa.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   First story of the day.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Oh, there's so many to choose from.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I mean, it's been three weeks of news.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Should we talk about, what do we want to talk about?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You want to talk about Apple's announcements on the--
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   No, actually, let me call one, Leo.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Oh, and please.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   What is this about Microsoft shutting down MSN chat?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   What is it about that?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Are they afraid of--
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's not the first time Microsoft has shut down something.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Remember, they used to run those minute meeting servers and they turned out to be a hot bed
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   for horny men and women.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Could it be the same things going on here?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   No.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You know, if it is, I mean, it's just like new.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   This has been a--
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   This thing's been here for a decade and now all of a sudden they've discovered that,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   like, you know, people are like flirting with each other in some odd way online.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   We are shocked to find out.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There's some--
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   What's going on here?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Well, according--
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Will they say that after October the 18th it says, "MSN chat will no longer be offered.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Please download Windows Live Messenger."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's really what's happening.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   They're moving to live.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Everything's going live.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   But is MSN chat and Windows--
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   They're the same thing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Have you used Live Messenger?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's just a relabeled MSN chat.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   They say MSN chat has--
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   No, I think they're talking about shutting down MSN chat as in, like, the Yahoo chat kind of web page.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh, web site chat, not MSN--
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yes.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, I see.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So it's just relabeling it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Nobody uses it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Does anybody use it?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I mean, people use the Messenger chat.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, but this is, as Will has correctly pointed out, this is web-based chat.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Who uses it?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Well, I think that's the point, isn't it?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Is that web-based chat used to be really the thing sort of back in the day and everybody would hang up
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   on Yahoo chat and you'd have all these gazillions of different rooms and stuff.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But now, if you're going to use the URL, go to the M.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Do you know about--
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Everyone just uses I-M, actually.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I'm not buying it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I like MSN Live, actually.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Have you played with Live at all?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Not me.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Robert, have you played with it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The Live website.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, well, of course.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That's where the chat's going to live.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I think Microsoft's doing some really interesting things there.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's Live--
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You're the only one who thinks that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Am I?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Does anybody else in the group think that?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Actually, there is one thing that Microsoft is doing with Live and with Messaging that is really cool.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And that's linking Xbox users with Windows users and then they'll play against each other and chat with each other.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I love that idea.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   To be on your PC and if you're in like I-M and you can see, like, if one of your mates is playing an Xbox game
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and then you can just go and join in the game with them and that's pretty neat.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But aside from that, you know--
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's a billion dollar idea.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You want to see some cool things.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Microsoft's doing kind of the same thing that Google does with the research, Google Labs.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   If you go to-- I think it's labs.live.com.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   There's some really neat stuff that-- I mean, Microsoft--
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Look, you've got to admit Microsoft has some smart people working there, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So this is their kind of clever thing.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Well, it doesn't have one of the biggest research budgets in the business.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Yeah, I'm sure it does.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It sure does.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It has huge R&D budget.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think it's pretty cool.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Look at C-Dragon.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   John.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I'm looking here.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'm at the site as we speak.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's Photosin't, though.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's really fascinating.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Let's see.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Entity extraction.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Search RFP winners.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Live Labs update.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Live Labs manifesto by a guy named Flake.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   All right.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's fascinating.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   All right.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   There's some cool stuff.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I think--
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   There's pictures of the staff.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Live.com is a pretty-- among all of the Ajax-y home pages, I think it's a pretty good one.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I like these Ajax home pages.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Are you still using your kind of homemade front page, John?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Yeah, I do have a guy did a CSS version for me.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I haven't really posted it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I've been playing around with Protopage.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Was it Protopage?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's great.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I love Protopage.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah, well, that to me is like the epitome of this Ajax kind of page.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And then Microsoft's essentially copying it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Do you like pageflakes?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That's another great one.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Try pageflakes.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I haven't not seen pageflakes.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The two I like a lot.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I love Protopage.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I like NetVibe and I like pageflakes.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   They're all the same.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's the same idea.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's just a different tool set.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You know where it goes?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   You can move stuff around.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You know what really shines is RSS.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I have a NetVibes.com homepage.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And then you put your feeds on it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So your homepage becomes your feeds.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Google is great too.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Google.com/ig.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Not a great name, but it's a great.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Okay, I'm looking at C-Dragon that you sent me to.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I like the logo.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's got a logo.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   C-Dragon is an incubation project resulting from the acquisition of C-Dragon.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They bought somebody.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Okay, that's creative.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   C-Dragon software in February, it's same, which means it'll be good for a while.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And then Microsoft will do what it does.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I didn't say anything.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Turn it into a Microsoft product.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Yeah, a front page.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   An example.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You know they're dumping front page.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Oh, after blowing it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, here's an example of what Microsoft does.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   They buy a nice little company.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They got a pretty good little product because it seems to work very well.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And slowly the meddlers at Microsoft ruin it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Now they have to dump it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Does that make sense to anybody?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   You're right.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You're right.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You're right.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   What do you think about Eric Schmidt joining Apple's board?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Do you think that means some sort of relationship between Google and Apple coming down the world?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Well, actually I wrote this up at MarketWatch.com.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You should get people out there should read this.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Ended up on CNBC doing a little piece of body.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's got a lot of page views.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   My theory was that it's a prelude to Apple and Sun merging.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Sun?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   There's no question that...
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Explain that.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Well, I mean, Apple and Sun, there's been rumors in the Valley for the last 15 years about Apple
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and Sun buying Apple or Apple buying Sun or one of the two.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And they never really could do that deal.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   For a lot of different reasons and one of the reasons is that neither one of the two merging
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   companies could really live with any CEO from the other company.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   In other words, they didn't like Steve Jobs.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They didn't like Spinner like McNeely.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I mean, nobody was liked.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And Eric Schmidt was always kind of like a very well liked guy on both sides.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   He now shows up over here.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I think he's in there as a straw man to eventually run a combined Apple Sun.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Eric used to work at Sun.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Yes.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And he still has...
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   No matter what anybody wants to say, he's very well connected to Sun.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I think he's still pretty much a Sun guy and he's a hard work guy.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And I think he's sick of working at Google.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   All right.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I mean, it's just too crazy over there for him.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I mean, everybody at Google's at Burning Man this week.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Did you see there's an interesting list of like possible Apple merges and various things.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And someone came up with like a list of really cool names.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It was the Sun Apple merger called Snapple.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Snapple.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's obvious.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Snapple.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   That's stuff on Earth.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Snapple.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   What would happen?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That's not bad.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   What would Apple gain by emerging?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well, Apple, if you haven't noticed, has been, you know, ever since they went to the Intel site,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   they've been really pushing a very, not with a lot of noise, but they've been serious about
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   moving into the server game.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And they don't really have the kind of prestigious servers that people are going to flock to.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Meanwhile, Andy Bectil-Shum has gone over to the Sun and has done a whole bunch of really fancy
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   servers and it's really put them back on track in so far as the server game is concerned.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But they haven't got the marketing let alone the market share price or anything else to
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   actually push these things into the market.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Apple does.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   The combination is perfect.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So do you think, John, do you think Jonathan Schwartz is a bit of a dead duck?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   He's a new guy.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   He's just a guy that says he's holding a pattern.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I mean, Jonathan Schwartz is a nice enough guy, but he's not like a powerful CEO.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   No, he is.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   He doesn't really.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   He's got a ponytail, for God's sake.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   You can't be a CEO with a ponytail.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Can we think of one CEO that has a ponytail?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Well, it depends.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   There's probably a CEO of some body lotion company that has a ponytail, but that's about
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Are you going to run out Robert Herron and buy this giant?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   What is it?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   105 inch plasma display that Panasonic $80,000?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   103 inch.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I want one.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   80.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Please.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Who would buy this?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   80 grand.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, it actually is representative of a great value in terms of if you look at what the prices
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   of the prices of the largest displays like a year ago.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   They were effectively twice that much.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Well, I remember them showing it was.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But that's just crazy.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   80 grand is for the people who have, you know, they're looking for something to buy.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.480]   You know, has anybody ever questioned these companies about whether these are just demo
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.800]   units that are just going to show them and they put a price tag on them and they never
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   really sell any?
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   Does anyone know anybody who's bought one of these monstrosities?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   I don't.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.080]   I know a lot of which guys.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.320]   It's really, really for trade shows, isn't it?
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.000]   And it started with Samsung and then LG and a lot of it's for commercial use.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.400]   I mean, the people who are buying these probably don't want it, you know, public size that,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.120]   hey, by the way, this is what I can afford and stick in my house except for like the
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.920]   Mark Cubans of the world who, you know, was pretty public about his wanting of one of
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   these displays.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.760]   But other than that, why isn't Mark pick it up?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.360]   I wonder whether they really make them.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.120]   I think these are just one shots.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.280]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.120]   Just consider the how you have to get this into a house.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   I mean, from either you have a very nice doorway, perhaps with a set of double doors.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.640]   Otherwise, it's a, that's a huge piece of glass, literally the size of a queen size bed.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   Just to put it in a.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.120]   Well, you can't bend perspective.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   No, fold it.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.400]   And if it's in the box, you can just about add a, you know, a foot to every dimension
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   in terms of trying to get something in or out of a place.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.920]   And this is definitely not the thing you're going to be seeing somebody trying to unpack
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.160]   in the, in either the, the parking lot of a store or out in their front yard unboxing
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.640]   it, trying to get it through the front doorway.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   This is usually going to be something that would be professionally installed for considerably
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.840]   more money on top of that.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.280]   But there's a, there's a small early adopter, Bragg worthy market who wants plasma displays
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   this large.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.160]   But otherwise you're talking a signage for, for either businesses or places they just
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   want to show off.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   Put it in a ballpark.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   Totally.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.960]   Not even outdoors though.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.200]   It'd be like maybe in the best suite at a ballpark.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.400]   It's too small for a ballpark.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.880]   Did you see while we were gone, Toshiba filed with the FCC for the zoom.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.440]   The first zoom unit, they're going to be at least one of the manufacturers for Microsoft's
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.240]   quote iPod killer 30 gig hard drive wifi connection.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   Toshiba confirmed.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   Yeah, we're making the zoom rhymes with ruin.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.920]   Zoom rhymes with ruin.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.640]   I like it.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.120]   It's a slogan.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.960]   It doesn't even play video.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   It does it.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.480]   I mean, how are you and I will all the latest reports say that video is like the second generation
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   of the device.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.720]   How do you kill an iPod without video?
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   No.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   That's ridiculous.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.280]   In fact, I think the rumors are probably right that Apple's got an announcement coming
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.720]   up in nine days September 12th.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.280]   And I think this is exactly, I mean, it's been almost exactly a year since the last iPod
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.320]   update.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.720]   Business Week said Apple is absolutely going forward with its store selling movies for
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.680]   $9.99 and $14.99.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.880]   What would be a perfect announcement?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.440]   Well, I think they're going to announce a new iPod.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.320]   I imagine they'll announce a new bigger screen iPod with better video, don't you think?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.720]   Yeah, but we've been thinking that for the last 12 months.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   Yeah, but it's time.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   It's time.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   Now's the time.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   I don't know if it'll be the touchscreen one that you see all the pictures of, but I
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.040]   think I don't think there's any question Apple will announce a video, a larger screen video
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.280]   iPod just in time to, you know, clobber the zoom.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   Good news.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.640]   I don't think it would get I say make a comment here.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   I don't think they need the clobber the zoom.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.440]   No, the zoom is self-clobbering.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   Yes.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.720]   That's one of the speeches.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.240]   Is that on the spec sheet?
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.840]   Yeah, yeah, self-clobbering.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   It's great.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   Good news.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.280]   We'll talk to you of that same thing.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.680]   Have you seen that in the last week, both Apple's DRM and Windows DRM has been handily
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   hacked?
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.080]   I'm thrilled because, you know, until iTunes 6, it was really easy to strip out the, you
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.880]   know, J-HIM would just strip out the copy protection in iTunes.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   And it's not that I'm stealing.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.440]   I'm not exactly, I'm not buying, you know, in fact, J-HIM, you know, your email address
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   was still in there unless you explicitly removed it.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.720]   So I'm not, it's like I'm uploading stuff to the nets.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   Everybody can steal it.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   But I want to move it around.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   I don't like the DRM.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.560]   It hobbles what I can do with it.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.600]   So yeah, now it's back.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.200]   QT FairU6, I guess they're calling it.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.000]   Yeah, and the same thing for Windows DRM as well.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Now that's what's interesting.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.800]   Is this the first time Windows DRM has been cracked?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.240]   Because I don't remember it being cracked before.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.320]   As far as I know, pretty much so.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.200]   I mean, I think it's partly because nobody's bothered breaking it because like, what do
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   you mean?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   Yeah, I've been twisted.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   Nobody's bothered because nobody cares.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.200]   No, you think that's why?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.960]   Yeah, I mean, you could get all this stuff and then I happen to go through there.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   Yes.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.240]   It's like nobody's cracked into the door that, you know, with the big lock on it because
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   you just go around the back.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.040]   Come on.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.720]   Okay, I think you're probably right.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.640]   Vista RC1 is out.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.320]   Now, Robert, you guys must be using it for DLTV.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.960]   And I just loaded it up on my personal system at home.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   And, and, and.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   Okay.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.880]   Compared to the, what was it, the 54 XX build, we'll say, whatever I was using previously,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.400]   it is far improved in terms of little performance fixes, bug fixes.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.320]   Which for are you using 57 XX?
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.960]   What, what, or 5600 is the latest RC1.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   5600, okay.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.240]   And supposedly that will go to, that'll be available for download on the 9th, they're
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   saying.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   But for any rate, anyone involved in the beta test system can actually download it right
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   now.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   Definitely.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.520]   I, I've never really had application crashes per se, either stuff works or it doesn't.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.560]   But yeah, so far, more of the little applications that I'm using are just flawless.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   And the media center, a portion of the operating system itself is part of Windows Ultimate
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.720]   is in my print, far more stable.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.680]   It's working with more hardware.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.280]   And I'm really actually having a good time with that as far as a media center style interface.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.880]   They did, I don't understand this, maybe you can explain it or will.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.720]   They forked the code.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.200]   There, there are two different code streams now.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.320]   There's the, the builds beginning with 5,400, through 56.99.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.600]   And then there's 5700.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.840]   And I guess 50, according to the Vista blog, 5700 is the RTM code.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.560]   So you're looking at RTRC1, release candidate one, and then they forked it to have a ready
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.840]   to manufacture, which is the, the final version.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   That would be the gold master.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   I don't understand why you'd fork it though.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.400]   I had to hit the voice.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.940]   Would you fork it for the purposes of getting a version that's ready to go out to businesses
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.680]   in November as they planned?
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   Maybe.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.880]   And then one to go out in January to consumers as they planned?
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.320]   I have no idea about that.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.200]   According to the blog, this is SOP, but I just don't quite understand it.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.800]   Amazon, whether by accident or intentionally, I guess it was intentionally released prices
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:01.360]   and said available January 30th, along with the office 2000 or office, whatever they're
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.960]   going to call it, new office.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.200]   Yeah, 2007.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.760]   I think so.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.000]   So you believe this?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You think that's what it's going to be?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   January 30th.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.720]   They're moving along.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   I think so.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.960]   The DVD was for Windows Vista Ultimate.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   Nice.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.720]   Do you want to guess a price, John?
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.280]   Probably too much.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.840]   400 smackers.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.880]   If you want to do the upgrade, and that's just the upgrade.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   It's $2.59.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.280]   This is the Steve Ballmer situation.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.920]   I mean, Steve's a nice enough guy, but he's the one who pushes these high prices.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.760]   I don't know what to put his think in his.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.560]   It seems like, well, it seems like you're just asking people to pirate it.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:47.280]   The cheapest version is the Windows Vista Home Basic Upgrade, which is, you know, like
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.040]   you get nothing, but at least you can say you're running Vista and that's $99.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.680]   Yeah, and I'm sure it doesn't do anything.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.120]   Yeah, you probably want to upgrade.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.880]   It's great to throw away $100.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.760]   Okay, but right now the XP Pro with a CD, the full retail box copy isn't that close to
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   $300 right now?
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   I know I bought it.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.400]   $400 is not necessarily a special design.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   I bought it.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.520]   I'm an idiot.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   I went out.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.640]   Why would you get Windows XP?
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   Because I needed XP.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.560]   I needed it for bootcamp for the Apple.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.400]   I needed a copy.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.200]   I, at the time, didn't realize I could use an upgrade version.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   You could have called Apple PR and go, or I'm sorry, Microsoft PR and gov and copy.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.200]   Definitely wasn't going to get it from Apple PR.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   Yeah, you never know.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.960]   So I'm just checking to see what the, if Windows Vista is now yet on the Amazon top
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.200]   100 software and I don't see it yet.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.480]   I think for people, I don't see people running out to necessarily buy this.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   The day it ships either.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   I wouldn't.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   But we have to.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.160]   Of course, that's where a majority of the sales end up going, but we as far as.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.880]   But don't you think there'll be real pressure on everybody if you're running XP to upgrade?
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.200]   I mean, that's certainly Apple's made a lot of money over the last five years.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.160]   But the point is, what are you upgrading to?
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.000]   What are you getting?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.760]   I think if you have the latest hardware and you really want to show it off with the Windows
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.880]   operating system, then sure.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.840]   Otherwise, there's some great alternatives nowadays where, you know, the top, the highest
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.920]   rank, it's number 77 on the Amazon software top 100.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.960]   It's Windows Vista ultimate upgrade.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.360]   What's number one?
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   The number one.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   All right.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   Let me go back to the page.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.200]   The number one software package.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   By the way, right after Windows Vista, the upgrade, Nancy Drew Deception Island, the DVD.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.040]   Awesome.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.720]   So I think you should get them together.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.560]   I'm sure there's a bundle.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.080]   The number one program.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.480]   Oh God.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.640]   On Amazon is Norton Internet Security.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.640]   The one program I tell everybody not to get.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.320]   And then right after that Norton antivirus, which is the only one, it's complete.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   Only marginal.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.240]   You've managed to really influence the public, Derleo.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.880]   I guess they're not listening to me.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.440]   So what's number three?
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.800]   Apple.Mac.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.040]   Which I don't know why you would buy that.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.240]   What's Apple.Mac?
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.360]   That's the, you know, basically the subscription to their online.Mac account where you can upload
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   stuff.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   What's dot Mac?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   I don't even know about it.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   Well, you're not a Mac user.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.320]   It's a gigabyte of storage.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.840]   It's email, but mostly people use it because you can then use it to synchronize iCal.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   Gigabyte of storage.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.120]   Are there's Macs being shipped without hard disks?
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   No, no, no.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   It's off online backup.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   And you get an app Mac.com email address.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   You get one from Mac.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   You get one from Mac.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   It's great.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   You can buy more.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   But you know, I use it.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.380]   What's nice is all OS 10 machines have this iDIS capability where if you create an iDIS
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.360]   get automatically synchronized with dot Mac and other machines so you can have kind of,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.800]   which I do, I have kind of a documents folder that is stuff that I want to have available
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   to all my Macs.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.460]   And then it synchronizes iCal and your address book.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.460]   It's worth it.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.460]   It's worth it.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.460]   It's worth it.
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.460]   I'm sure it is.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.460]   Okay.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.740]   Number four is actually Dragon Naturally Speaking Nine, which just came out.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   And I've been using that.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.740]   It's pretty good.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.940]   David Pogue convinced me to get it because he, you know, David Pogue uses it not to write
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.780]   his books, but to write to the indexes of his books.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.820]   So he does his own indexes, John, which is insane.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.580]   That's very funny.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.260]   It's insane because of it for people out there wondering why you want to know what indexing
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.260]   is.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.500]   You get these books and you have the index it right?
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.980]   You have to put these and they have you can hire and most of the time the publisher
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.980]   will do this for you.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.620]   They'll hire professional indexing service and they'll do it for you.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.980]   And it uses pretty good or you can have machine indexing or you can have a combination of
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.220]   the two, which is the really the way to do it.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.500]   In other words, he doesn't the human indexers do a lousy job.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.140]   He says he does a better job.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.140]   He's a human.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.300]   Yeah, but he knows he wrote it.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.780]   So he knows, you know, kind of better than anyone what, you know, what should be indexed.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.460]   And what, which is a good study.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   It's a good study.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.300]   But he actually has a kind of neat system where he'll be going through the book and
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.940]   I'll say page four, you know, tips for, you know, what it is.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.660]   It's just, it's David really likes reading his own stuff.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.460]   Somebody's got to five books this year.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.940]   Number five, Microsoft Windows live one care, which actually I'm starting to recommend as
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.180]   a decent antivirus anti spyware solution.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.180]   It's cheap.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.660]   It's 30, it's what 20 bucks and you get three computers, you get antivirus.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.580]   I think it's not a bad solution.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.220]   And then number six, Nancy Drew danger by design.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.820]   Apparently Nancy Drew is all over this list.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.820]   Wow.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.820]   Very big.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.940]   This cut me by surprise.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.180]   I think you underestimate the Nancy Drew contingent.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   Maybe you don't.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   I know I do.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.740]   I think you should write a market watch column.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   I'm my major.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   The resurgence of Nancy Drew.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.580]   Nancy Drew.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.780]   I mean, who's the marketing genius behind this?
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.780]   I don't know what they're doing.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.340]   Let me see what the who publishes this.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.140]   You know, when I, when our kids were little, we bought a lot of that kind of stuff, you
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   know, the DVD.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.300]   It's her interactive.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:04.220]   I mean, this is the number, this is, this is the first game on the list is a game for
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.220]   girls.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.820]   I think that's, I think it's, I'm telling you, market watch, baby.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.340]   This is a big story.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.340]   Her interactive.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.380]   I think it just tells you that real gamers go and get their games not from Amazon.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.980]   Here's the product features.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:24.700]   Nancy Drew needs to fly to Paris to investigate the strange and unexplained behavior of Minnet,
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.140]   a top fashion designer.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.440]   You meet Jing Jing Ling, who may be out for revenge and the famous photographer, Dieter
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.380]   von Schweisterkank, who once had an ill-fated romance with Minnet.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.060]   Don't you get back on the voices?
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.220]   Don't you want to buy it?
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   I know.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.100]   I don't know reason I'm reading this review so I can do the voices, frankly.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.220]   But it does make you want to buy it.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.980]   I'm looking at the her interactive.com site right now and it's, they got a lot of stuff.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.660]   I will have to follow up on this.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660]   It's girl.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.020]   Remember that that was the kind of topic for while girl games, why girls don't play games
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.020]   and we would, you know.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.500]   Yeah, but you know one of the things that I followed this pretty closely until now,
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.260]   obviously, but these games that were designed for girls were almost designed for girls as
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.700]   if they were idiots.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   Exactly.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.820]   I mean, that one company, what was it?
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.500]   The Harvest with the Moon, whatever it was that Paul Allen company.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.820]   It was humiliating those games.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.820]   I agree.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.060]   No girl, no anybody would want to play them.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   Well, I saw a really interesting article a couple of weeks back, which was this guy
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.980]   that took his Xbox 360 and a pile of games and gave it to his mum and then chronicled,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.500]   like he got his mum to write like a blog of her experiences with all the different games
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.500]   and stuff.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.300]   And apparently her favourite game was Dead Rising.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   Oh, oh no.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.300]   No.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.860]   Because she said it was the one that had the most, she was saying playing games like Prey
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.420]   and FPS and stuff.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.060]   It would, there were too many false conventions, like too many things that you were expected
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.740]   to know about the genre before you could even play, whereas Dead Rising, you could pick
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.220]   it up and pretty much anything you could think of to do.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.260]   You could take the manual, you just keep everything that moves.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.260]   You know, I remember there's a story that started to crack your rans.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.540]   We ran it on the blog about how some of these bloodthirsty girls are playing some of these,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.300]   you know, it's pretty gruesome games.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:12.420]   My daughter plays Half-Life 2 or she played it for a while, which is pretty, and she played,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.540]   she played it when she'd get into all this creepy, and she'd shut the game down and she'd
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.740]   come over, she says, "That is the creepiest game I'm out of here," and she'd go downstairs.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.380]   And then a few days later she'd take it on again and then she'd come back shaking,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.740]   "Go, that's horrible!"
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.460]   I think they should get her purple moon.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.300]   Purple moons for girls.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.060]   You know, purple moon got nowhere.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.780]   Meanwhile, you know, they've got these kids, you know, taking on some of these pretty,
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.980]   I mean, it's just all virtual, but it's pretty fun.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.100]   Dead Ra, I'm actually dying to get Dead Rising.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.300]   It sounds like a great game.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.740]   The idea is you just, everything that moves is going to kill you, so you have to kill
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.380]   it and you can kill it with whatever you can find.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   You're in a mall, right?
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.380]   Have you played this well?
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.380]   All right, I've played this.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:57.260]   Oh, you've, my sons, they had a copy immediately, JC, and it's a hilarious game.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.260]   It's actually quite funny.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.420]   I mean, you're killing with tennis rackets, garbage, anything you can use, right?
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:08.100]   Right, the premise of the story is that you're apparently dropped into a mall full of zombies
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.300]   and you're supposed to, you're supposed to like do a store, you're a reporter and a
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.620]   photographer or something like that, and you're dropped off and you have like 48 hours to
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.100]   get a couple of stories out.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.740]   And there's also a lot of sandbox activity where you can just go killing people.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:28.620]   But these zombies and a bunch of other stragglers who aren't zombies who think you are, who
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.940]   try to kill you and they're a little faster, the zombies are slow moving.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.060]   And the whole game consists of very creative ways to bash people over the head with all
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.540]   kinds of cans and bottles and kitchen utensils and these guys are, and it's actually quite
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.540]   fun.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.180]   It's one of the funnier games you'll ever watch somebody play.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.980]   I'm dying, I get it.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   Taking pictures of the zombies, that's one of my favorite parts.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.860]   Why do you take pictures of the zombies?
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.860]   Part of your job.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.780]   Part of it's the job or part of it's also villains that you're on.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.820]   You're a reporter trying to get the story.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.860]   So there is more going on than just kill anything that moves.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.860]   Yeah, no, if you go in the sandbox mode, it's pretty much just killing anything that moves.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.900]   But if you want to actually play the game, you have to actually do stuff.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.260]   I think I just want to play the game.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.260]   It's gorgeous.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.900]   It's really a really fun game to play.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   How funny.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.740]   How funny.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:21.140]   Google asked to cooperate with the authorities in Brazil turned over data that Brazilian authorities
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.620]   said could help identify people taking part in online communities that encourage racism,
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.420]   pedophilia and homophobia.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.700]   Google says we didn't give the US Justice Department what they wanted because they wanted so
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   much.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:40.860]   Brazil is looking for specific cases involving or cut, which is Google's social networking
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.860]   site.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.740]   That thing's still running or cut.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.300]   Apparently, apparently it's been taking a lot of good choice.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   It's Brazil.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.340]   With homophones, racists and pedophiles.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.340]   That's whose usual.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.140]   How about your normal perverts?
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.060]   I mean, don't they have a place to go anymore?
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   You're actually right.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:06.380]   Well, or cut is especially popular in Brazil, which accounts for 75% of its 17 million users.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.380]   It's funny.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.500]   I didn't even know if or cut was still around.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.940]   But I think I found out the same thing about Friendster.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.700]   And Friendster has found a whole new market somewhere.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.660]   I can't remember Southeast Asia or somewhere.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.740]   If you think about it, that's how these social networking sites work.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.740]   It's all word of mouth.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.980]   Why is YouTube so big in the US?
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.220]   That's what everybody else is using.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.380]   That's what my friends use.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.380]   That's what I want to use.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.900]   And my space is a good example.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.180]   It seems to be like not in Canada, there's other stuff people use.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.180]   They don't use it so much.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.220]   I mean, it's pretty much high schoolers.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.540]   And if you go to Stickam, which is one of the more interesting ones that's cropped up,
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:52.180]   STICKAM, you'll find that it's a bunch of goofy kids, all pretty much in the same sociological
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.220]   kind of layer and it's the weirdest thing you've ever seen.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:00.260]   I had to, I was playing with my space account earlier this week.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.820]   I had it for a long time and I never really done anything with it.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.540]   I am stunned at how bad that user interface is.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.780]   In every way, the most jumped example of development I've ever seen on the net.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.220]   I mean, Web 2.0, it's not even Web 1.0.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.020]   It's Web 0.8.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.500]   And 90 million people think this is the state of the art on the web.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   It's unbelievable.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.260]   Kind of depressing, frankly.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.300]   Well, they'll snap out of it.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.460]   Well, it's interesting to think that every little subculture now is going to have its
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:36.820]   site and there'll be a million different big internet sites that you never heard of.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   Well, the funny thing about Orcut is that it came in shortly.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.260]   The story behind Orcut is that Google wanted to, they saw this social networking thing
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.500]   and they wanted to buy a friend's turn offered them like $35 million and they refused to
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.380]   take it, which they should have.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:58.060]   And so they cobbled together this thing overnight and basically everybody I know that invited
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.620]   me to LinkedIn immediately invited me to Orcut.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.620]   It was like a very short term of fad.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   That's right.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.220]   And I have an account there and this fad lasted about 90 days.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.900]   I never got invited again and nobody, it's just like everybody abandoned it.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:19.420]   But I did notice it was starting to pick up some steam in Brazil and if anyone goes
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.060]   to Brazil a lot, you'll know that this is the most social country in the world.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.060]   I mean, these people are so sociable.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:31.340]   They want to, I mean, all they want to do is party and make friends and talk and eat
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.340]   out.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.340]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.340]   And that's all, I mean, that's like their specialty.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.220]   So the fact that Orcut caught on in Brazil, it doesn't surprise me that it and probably
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.460]   a half dozen other of these systems are big in Brazil.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.860]   I finally had a cappereña.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.860]   What is that?
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.540]   How do you pronounce it?
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   Did I say it wrong?
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   Capereña, yeah.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.540]   Pretty much.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   I mean, I don't pronounce it quite right either.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540]   It was good.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.340]   I mean, it's, it depends on whether the cassachia is good.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.540]   It'll be pretty tasty.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.340]   So cassachia seemed to me like more like tequila than brandy.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.340]   But anyway, we digress.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.540]   Did it point out what kind of information Google provided?
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.900]   I always mispronounce that, by the way.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.900]   Cassacha?
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.260]   Yeah, that's not really the pronunciation.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:17.540]   Cassacha is the capital of a African nation, I believe, the Congo or something.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.380]   Let me see if they said what exactly Google's giving.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:26.100]   I mean, it makes sense that if it's a more constrained, it's not a fishing expedition,
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   anyway.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.780]   They were threatened, might have had something to do with a $23,000.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.780]   They fine.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.300]   Google has complied, blah, blah, blah, the Brazilian authorities, particularly interested
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.580]   in IP addresses with time and date stamps.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.540]   That's pretty specific, isn't it?
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.660]   I guess it's just that you'd-- it's just a matter of time for all thrown in jail.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.980]   Essentially, Google, it's really up to them in terms of what information they wanted to
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   supply.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.340]   Well, even Mark, you just kind of hope that they're being altruistic about their motives.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   Even Mark--
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.100]   It seems like it's so easy to abuse.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.380]   Even Mark Rotenberg of Epic, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.980]   said they didn't have any choice.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.860]   If they have the records and they're legally, you know, subpoenaed for the records, they've
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.740]   got to produce them.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.300]   The issue is, I think, how long should companies retain these records?
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.540]   Shouldn't they be getting rid of them?
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.540]   The problem--
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.020]   Google gets rid of nothing, I'm sure, because it's valuable to it.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.020]   How valuable could it be?
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.860]   I mean, I think we'd take-- you know, remember Pud over at FUCcompany.com?
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   Yes, yes.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.220]   He would destroy his records on a daily basis.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220]   Good for him.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.540]   And I think a lot of companies do do that for that very reason.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.340]   They don't want to be subpoenaed.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.740]   But think about Google's business model.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.660]   The reason they keep it is really their model is sell advertising.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.020]   The more they know about who's online and what they search for and what they do, the
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.020]   better.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.500]   I thought businesses had to keep email for like five years.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   By what law?
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.860]   I thought here in the state of California, that--
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.460]   I think that Sarbanes Oxley's got something to do with that, but I don't think that necessarily
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   applies to all companies.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.340]   That would be a public company for one thing.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.340]   And it would have to--
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.340]   Okay.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.180]   It would have to do with their own internal emails as opposed to--
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.900]   Because that was a gig my buddy at mine was working on for a long time was just setting
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.100]   up very secure permanent repositories for the--
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.100]   I think that's Sarbanes Ox.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   I think that's Sarbanes compliance.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.780]   And I think I think I think of internal email as opposed to if you're an email company
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.300]   like Gmail or something.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.460]   Right, exactly.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.500]   Rottenberg said it's almost a defining moment for the industry.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.300]   They need to decide if they want to become a one-stop shop for government prosecutors.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.940]   That's a good point.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.940]   That's a good line.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.500]   I think it probably is time to say, look, you've got to delete this stuff.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.700]   Well, there's also--
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.820]   I mean, if we're concerned about it, there are IP spoofs and proxies and--
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.780]   Yeah, we should all be using Tor servers.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.620]   But it's also interesting that the whole thing operates on differences of degree rather
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.620]   than of kind.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.460]   I mean, we might sit here and say, well, we want people to delete their logs because
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.540]   we don't people know what we're surfing and if we're looking at ways to circumvent
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.300]   XP protection or whatever.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.020]   But then when it comes to things like child pornography and that sort of thing, it's
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.220]   like, well, shouldn't we actually be bringing those people to justice?
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.260]   So would you be wrong to throw out all those logs in that case, given that you'd be apprehending
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.740]   proper quote, proper criminals?
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:33.740]   Well, I think ideally or idealistically what you say is right.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.460]   But the fact of the matter is it's like the government's surveillance of individuals
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.780]   worried about terrorism, it's like there are other ways of capturing these people without
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:50.980]   having to like subject the entire public to like this kind of scrutiny where you get caught
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.220]   up in a dragnet when you really haven't done anything.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.540]   And I think they've got to find other ways of doing it besides just scraping.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.220]   I mean, this is the easy way out.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.300]   I mean, the FBI's always wanted to ban all kinds of things like encryption and whatever,
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.700]   just because it makes their job easier.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.140]   I don't think their job should be easier.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   It's a tough job.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.940]   They should tough it out.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   Tough enough.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:15.060]   Devorax says, no, I think since the days of the founding fathers, that's been the debate.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:20.700]   How much do you give up for the few to capture the few?
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.580]   But you've got to protect the privacy of the many.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.540]   I think that that's what the Constitution's always been about.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   The Bill of Rights has always been about.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.180]   I don't think there's any question, at least in this country.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.380]   I don't know how it is in your land, Will.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.220]   Well, I mean, it's funny because the that's exactly come up this week because the New York
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.100]   Times has censored its output for Rita's in Britain.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.860]   Really, but not so the New York.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]   Which has been crazy.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:48.060]   No, it's written a story about the about a British sort of terror case that happened
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.580]   over here where all the planes went crazy, you know, a few weeks ago.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.420]   And it blocked access to the story if you're in the UK because they said that the story
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.180]   you would break UK laws.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.140]   It's a real issue now because we were really in a global environment and somebody like
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.380]   the New York Times has now got to consider every little country in their not the Britain's
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.300]   a small country, but every country has to be considered, right?
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.420]   So you put something on the internet.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.420]   What are you going to do?
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.180]   That's what we'll see is what we haven't seen, which I think is going to come.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.220]   And until there's an international effect, I used to have I should repost this on the
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.220]   blog.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.460]   I have it still a friend of mine who was an IP attorney and he actually used to be the
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.660]   copyrighted attorney at Simon & Schuster, I believe, wrote a treaty, proposed treaty
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:36.460]   because there needs to be some sort of information age treaty that deals with the situation where
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.860]   these websites, you know, which are being read in Germany that may be Nazi sites, but
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:47.620]   you know, which is an extreme case, but in a lesser case, as an and as an example, in
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.660]   many countries in Europe, it's illegal literally to do comparison advertising.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.380]   You can't make put the box up and say, this costs less and this costs more.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.580]   And the fact of the matter is if the New York Times is so concerned about what's happening
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.140]   in England that they would do this kind of blocking, where is the, you know, the kind
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.300]   of the ambulance chasers that are out there somewhere in the world that can just start
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.900]   suing the crap out of all these websites who are like violating weird international
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.260]   laws here and there because there's stuff on the internet.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.780]   I mean, this is going to happen if something isn't done about this.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.900]   And the fact that the New York Times knuckle under to what they perceive as an illegal
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.900]   act is a disaster.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.820]   I agree, in fact, it could totally change the way the internet works.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.380]   Now of course, the irony of it all is with all this attention, the story has been published
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.420]   everywhere widely, including the UK by other sites.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.580]   So in fact, two British newspapers picked up the story and published the details.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.820]   So they apparently have more guts than the New York Times does.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.300]   It's funny, my uncle is a former CIA agent who just loads the New York Times as many in
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.580]   the, well, many.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:00.660]   I mean, a lot of these spy guys do because the Times has been very forthright about publishing
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.820]   details that they say they shouldn't.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.340]   It's bad.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.700]   After the government, oh, he hates the New York Times.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.420]   A lot of people feel that the New York Times is the front for the CIA.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.940]   Can't win.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.300]   Maybe that's their secret plan.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.180]   Maybe he's giving me some disinformation.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.940]   Maybe maybe he actually works for the New York Times.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:27.820]   Microsoft just published a patent for conjugating a verb.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.460]   Another bogus patent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.260]   I guess there's nothing more to say than that.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.700]   That just, my English teacher in the third grade should have gotten that back.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.860]   I think there's prior art.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.420]   I'm guessing.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.860]   But maybe, you know, maybe it's in a specific context or something like that.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:52.940]   Well, saying as many as what, how many 10th, 10% of its workforce, 10,000 people will
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.940]   be laid off.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:00.300]   Tuesday, we'll find out that's when they're going to have an internal webcast and make
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.340]   the announcement.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.860]   A structural review, according to our buddy Chuck Malloy.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.300]   There's a lot of people that irked about this.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.940]   I've been getting a lot of email from Intel people saying that there's something screwy
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   about this.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   Why, how so?
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940]   What do they think?
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.940]   I don't know.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   It's just suspicious.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.660]   I haven't gotten to the bottom of it myself.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.580]   We'll find out Tuesday after the stock market closes, of course.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.580]   Which is a bad sign.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.740]   What about the Sony battery thing?
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.140]   I mean, first Dell with four point, we weren't around to talk about it, but first Dell, we're
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.500]   calling 4.1 million lithium ion batteries.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.740]   And Apple then a week later, recording, we're calling 1.1 million.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   Turns out they were all made by Sony.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:50.380]   Sony's hired a or assigned one of its presidents to be a battery quality control officer.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.540]   That's what I feel sorry for the poor guy.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   I went a terrible job.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.020]   It's going to cost Sony as much as $200 million.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.020]   They're going to have to pay for these.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.860]   They were all made at Sony's plant north of Tokyo.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.260]   But here's the interesting thing, with over 5 million batteries recalled, that's only
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:19.020]   75% of the batteries made that they believe are faulty.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:24.940]   Which means that 25% of them, more than a million, are still in somebody's computer system.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.100]   Yeah, they could blow up at any time.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.020]   People out there, if you have an Apple, which is the iBook or one of those.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.620]   The iBook, the iBook, yeah.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.620]   So the first recall actually sent my battery back a couple of months ago to Apple.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.260]   It was an earlier recall.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.260]   Or a Dell.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.900]   I would get those batteries replaced because these things will blow up without the thing
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   being plugged in without machine being turned on.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.540]   It's just a handful of occasions.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.180]   It's not that common considering there's millions of them out there.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:57.180]   Well, John, did you unplug your computer?
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.420]   I use a Toshiba R200.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.940]   The best computer you can buy.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.740]   It doesn't have a Sony battery in it.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.260]   Not worry about it.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.740]   I think it's not that anything for anybody to worry about.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.740]   But it's certainly true.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.300]   I think you should worry about it if you have one.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.460]   If you have one, I'd get it in there.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.940]   I wouldn't waste time.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.740]   I'd find out.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.740]   Take advantage of it.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.740]   It's very easy.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.020]   When I did the previous Apple one, you fill out the form on the website.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.420]   The next day you get a box with a new battery.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.380]   You put the new battery in your computer, put the old battery in the box and it's post-paid
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.380]   and you ship it back.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.660]   It's very easy to do.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.940]   I wonder if anybody that has a Dell has the same experience.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.500]   That sounds like a pretty good plan.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.500]   It was very straightforward.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:39.300]   Well, actually, one analyst said this could actually be good for Apple and Dell because
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.460]   it shows how responsive they are, how good their customer service is.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.260]   Is it a black mark or is it a good thing?
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.180]   Now that they can blame Sony, it's not a black mark, is it?
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.820]   It's not good.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.060]   Good for anybody.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.460]   By-roll frog, how's that for a name?
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.460]   Good or bad?
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.460]   Rubbish.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:05.240]   Does it sound like something that a middle-aged executive would come up with trying to be
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.420]   hip and cool and cute?
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.100]   That's exactly it.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.660]   It's such a lame service.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.540]   It's been all over the mainstream media of, "Wow, people can let you download music for
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:22.220]   free and the actual deal that you get is just so rubbish."
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.860]   I haven't tried it to talk about it.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   Well, every time you want to go and download a tune, you have to listen to a 90-second
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.100]   audio commercial, every tune that you want to download.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.980]   The music comes in, protected Windows Media, so you can't put it on your iPod, you can't
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.660]   burn it to a CD.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.660]   How how's it's quality?
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.860]   Is it sound okay?
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.140]   No, it's like 128K.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.980]   So it's not awesome.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:54.740]   And then you have to go back to the website every month to view advertisements or the
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.540]   Samsung downloaded expire.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.540]   No.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   So it's not even once.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.540]   You have to keep watching.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.940]   You have to go back every month to look at more ads, otherwise your songs are going to
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   expire.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.180]   Oh, who's going to do that?
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.620]   I mean, surely you just...
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.620]   Who's going to do that?
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.340]   All of MP3 or something.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   That's crazy.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.140]   There's just no point in it.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.060]   And it's great to see people trying to do something different.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.660]   I mean, fair play to the record industry for actually trying to try something a bit different.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:25.620]   But it's one of those just completely lame ideas where nobody with a clue would come up
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.620]   with it.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.780]   Dastly.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.420]   Not much more to say about that.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:38.380]   John, were you considering going to Savon Lina in Finland to cover the mobile phone throwing
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.220]   world championship?
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.220]   I think next year.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:47.540]   I watched a...there's a couple of YouTube movies on showing these guys throwing these
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.540]   things.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   89 meters.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.540]   Mostly...yeah, I know.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.900]   It's weird because you watch these guys.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.740]   So most of these Scandinavian seem to throw like a girl.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.940]   You know, I think if you throw on a cell phone, there really is no choice.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:05.820]   Well, anyway, I think if you had the flat...like a flat phone and you gave it kind of a frisbee
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:11.580]   like or some sort of like a flip swing, you had to sort of construct it like skim.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.180]   So you know, like take flight.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.580]   I think you get a pretty good distance.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.380]   So you think a razor would do better, say, than a trio?
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.380]   Yeah, a razor.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.460]   Yeah, something that's flat and thin.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.180]   Not necessarily the razor that opens up with that flat...what's it called?
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   Something else.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   It's not the razor.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.660]   It's the one that's like the candy bar one.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.660]   Oh, the chocolate.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.660]   The chocolate.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.060]   Yeah, the chocolate.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.100]   Something that's like flat and thin and it's just like...
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.860]   Should the chocolate be brown, by the way?
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.860]   It should.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   It's black.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.860]   I don't understand it.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.500]   LG's new phone, which by the way, I bought for my son because he just insisted.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.340]   And I'm going to push over.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.340]   There you go.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.340]   It's the commercials.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.900]   Although there is a white version in the UK, so you get white chocolate.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.420]   Oh, well, that's all right.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.500]   Anyway, I think that would fly.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.900]   I think you really get some distance off of that sucker.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:58.500]   The winner was Finland's lassi et l'atou.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.820]   By the way, isn't everybody in Finland named lassi?
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.820]   I think so.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.980]   "Flong a scroun" now we're going to hear from.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.820]   Did you ever get your sweater from the finish, the Reykjavik Hardrock Cafe?
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.220]   Reykjavik's in Iceland.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.220]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.380]   Now you're really not going to get it.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.100]   I confused the two.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.100]   Iceland, Finland.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.100]   I don't know what the difference is.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.100]   Once it gets that cold, who cares?
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.540]   Over the 60th parallel I'm lost.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.860]   He flung a scrapped Nokia, which is super appropriate because I think they are.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.820]   If they're Finnish, aren't they not Icelandic?
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820]   So 89 meters.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.700]   He says, "I prepared by javelin throwing.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.460]   I hadn't really practiced throwing mobile phones."
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:46.020]   And then the Dutch guy, one silver, because he juggled the phone so nicely.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.540]   So I guess there wasn't a lot of confidence.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.540]   If you go to Reuters.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.940]   Actually, I'll try to put a link on my blog on this.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.940]   If you go to Reuters.com there's a video showing the guy juggling and he juggled and
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.700]   he threw two or three phones and he went 56 yards or something like that.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.100]   This whole thing was just kind of a goof, but I think it could take off.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.100]   I like the idea.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.420]   At least as good as University of California football.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.940]   Oh, go Bears.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.620]   How did the cow bears do?
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.740]   They had their rear ends handed to them when they thought they were going to go to the
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:21.820]   SEC down in the SEC or the SEC conference, Southern Southeastern Conference, SEC I guess,
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.100]   to beat Tennessee.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.500]   And of course it was like it was embarrassing.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.300]   It was like a high school team playing a college team.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.660]   Were they faced some real football?
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.580]   Interesting how YouTube has really taken off.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.860]   First you see here them mentioned on the Emmy Awards, which would seem to be their
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.100]   kind of natural enemy.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.860]   At least it was six months ago when NBC sued them.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.740]   Now on the, did you watch the MTV Video Awards this week?
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:55.180]   One of the hot videos on YouTube is that band, the OKGo band that they do the treadmills.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.700]   This treadmill video, have you seen that?
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   It's a wonderful video.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.700]   It is.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.260]   There's six treadmills and they do this great dance.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.260]   It's really totally homemade.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.620]   In fact, it's so homemade the beginning of the video is the guy pressing play on the remote
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.180]   controls of the musical play.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.500]   And apparently I guess his girlfriend choreographed it.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.620]   But it's one of those, you know, one of those YouTube viral videos, very cute.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.900]   The band does it live on the MTV Video Awards.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.620]   I mean, we'll talk about great publicity.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.500]   Is this anything like the, the, the, uh, Divo when they used to do this?
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.420]   It's kind of, it's kind of a one, one, one joke bit.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.580]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.980]   Divo, we had a treadmill, uh, song.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.980]   They jump off and off, on and off the treadmills.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:41.980]   They're singing one of their songs.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   This was like 15 years ago.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.980]   It all comes back to Divo.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.340]   And they, and I'm thinking, I hadn't seen this thing, but I'll take a look at it.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.580]   But it sounds like a rip off.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:55.860]   In the words of, uh, Marcel Proust, La Poussaintge, La Poulamem shows.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:00.700]   Boy, that's a letter.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.420]   That's definitely a trajectory to a monkey ranching to the show.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.940]   The longest pause in twin history.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.380]   I'm proud to say.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.740]   Yeah, they're people are going, I think my iPod died.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   What happened there?
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.980]   I, all I heard was some French and then, who were you quoting again?
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.980]   I'm the tumbleweed.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:20.980]   It was Proust.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.980]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.260]   I just joking around.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:31.300]   Oh, so we go for that $80,000 plasma, but the LCDs are seeing price cuts in 2007.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.300]   Isn't that good?
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.300]   Yes.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.300]   That's awesome, actually.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.300]   Right.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.200]   I still don't think they make that great of TVs comparatively, but what does Robert
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.780]   Heron, the king of HDTV own, but they're getting better.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   What do you own?
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.220]   I'm actually shopping this weekend for a new HDTV.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.220]   He won't buy anything.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.620]   He's a cheap guy.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.620]   I am.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.620]   I'm going to buy it too.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.620]   For a while you were into the Visto.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.620]   Yeah, the Vizio.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.980]   Vizio, rather, because it was inexpensive.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.260]   Still, I'm going over to Costco to check out that 42 inch.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.940]   Are you going to look at it?
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:04.780]   It is so ridiculously cheap compared to my, the first thing I really wanted, you know?
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.500]   You go and look at like the name Brandiks.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.620]   Which one are you looking at the 56?
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.620]   Which size are they at?
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.620]   No, 42 for mine.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.620]   For mine, partly.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.420]   Even the 56 is inexpensive.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   These are plasmas.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.740]   They're 50 inch plasma.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.740]   Oh, it's a plasma.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   That's right.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   Yeah, I don't want anything bigger than 50 inches because the resolution doesn't increase.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   Oh, interesting.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.980]   You're just simply, you're ending up with display with bigger pixels or pixels that
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.180]   are spaced further apart.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.420]   So if I also choose that more juice though too, right?
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:41.660]   You know, I have a 42 inch LCD in right now that consumes just as much juice as some 42
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.900]   inch plasmas I see.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:50.420]   So it's really a model by model display technology basis in terms of what consumes more power.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:55.380]   And of course the smaller displays, like the 32 inch LCDs do consume less power than say
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:00.340]   like a 32 inch tube TV or, and then there are no 32 inch plasma.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.260]   So it's really hard to make power consumption comparisons.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.420]   But generally speaking, once you hit 50 inches, they're all essentially consuming the same
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.580]   amount of power.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:14.380]   So you mean that like this 103 inch Panasonic has the same resolution as a 50 inch Panasonic.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   Okay.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.980]   In that case, that 103 inch is actually 1080p.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:26.700]   And right now, if you tried to buy a 1080p plasma, you're starting at a believe, I want
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.220]   to say it's 65 inches for the Panasonic and Japan.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.380]   And then LG has 71 inch panels.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.620]   But those are pretty huge for 1080p resolution.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:41.580]   Other than that, anything smaller than that and like the 50 inch range on up to 60 inch,
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.660]   they're all 720p or 1366, so 68.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   I'm surprised that you, Robert Herron, would even consider an HDTV that's not 1080p.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.740]   Yeah, 1920.
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.780]   There are other things that are more than important than the physical number of pixels.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.380]   Now if all things are equal, yeah, more pixels is always nice.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:05.060]   I should think in the pre-processing the image quality, it's a contrast ratios, arguably
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:10.220]   the single most important thing in terms of accurate and faithful image reproduction
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.740]   on a display device.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:16.420]   Having something that can produce very convincing black levels, inky blacks, and then having
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.100]   a nice well-grated range up through the grayscale.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:25.820]   So you produce colors that look smooth and natural and having a, however the color itself
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.060]   is actually generated.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:32.980]   Having, being able to produce not only the full gamut that's available in broadcast technology,
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.020]   but being able to reproduce that color accurately.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:42.660]   So what you're telling us with all this rationalization is that you really can't afford the 1920s.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.980]   Now that, and there's nothing in the size, honestly for me it's color.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.220]   Color I'm so picky about.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.340]   I just like the way his eyes sparkle when he starts talking about this stuff.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.420]   Most TVs nowadays, the flat panels, both on the plasma and the LCD side, I'm seeing very
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.940]   good contrast ratios.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:03.860]   They're almost neck and neck right now at the best end, about 1,000 to 1, both essentially
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:10.700]   very similar black levels in terms of making very dark, inky blacks, which goes back to
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.700]   color.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.860]   Also in turn makes for very well saturated, appearing colors.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.980]   But honestly the best looking displays I've seen this year so far in that 40 plus inch
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.340]   range is plasma displays.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.380]   LCDs too.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:30.380]   I mean, when you talk about those 32 inch displays that it is LCD, there are no plasmas that
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.380]   small so.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:38.980]   As long as we're spending money, you said you have a review of the new XPS online in BitTech
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   this week.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.860]   Yeah, yeah that's going on tomorrow hopefully which is quite good.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.500]   It happens to anybody else that says it's done it yet.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.740]   It's the new Dell.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.700]   It's been designed in a completely revamped chassis.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.140]   It's got Intel Core 2 Duo.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.940]   The system itself is fairly unspectacular.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:05.220]   It's Core 2 Duo, it's Nvidia graphics, a couple of gigs of RAM and some hard drives.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:10.380]   But what makes it really a bit more exciting is this new chassis that Dell has concocted
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:16.420]   which is designed specifically for this really high end enthusiast market.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.180]   It's the sort of thing that you'd expect to see out of Alienware actually but it's straight
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   out of Dell.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.780]   Well, it's bought Alienware.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.780]   I mean maybe they...
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.260]   Yeah, it just looks really, really, really good.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.860]   Which one is it?
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:35.220]   It's XPS 700 and you can go and check it out on the Dell site now but it's...
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.540]   They've been heavy ordinance as other described.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.940]   They've been killing one power supply.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.500]   How much are you paying for it?
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500]   Yeah, 750 or a kilowatt.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.500]   What would you do with a kilowatt power supply?
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.340]   It's the only one that comes with its own cooling tower.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.140]   It has a separate cooling tower?
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.660]   Yeah, that gives off steam.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.700]   You have to put it outside your house.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.900]   That's not true.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.900]   It is cool looking though.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.700]   I have to say that red front is pretty...
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.580]   It's pretty neat and it's pretty aggressive looking.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.460]   I mean it's really good build quality.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.860]   It's like 3mm aluminium all round which is lacquered.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.460]   So you get the really nice look of aluminium but it's completely scratch proof.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   It's really solid.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.460]   I think that's a nice idea.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   That's a very nice idea.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.100]   The front is all sort of vented.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:22.580]   The internals is crazy because instead of using the standard PC standards it uses BTX
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.340]   which is like the next generation of...
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.300]   Oh they finally got some BTX cases.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.700]   Yeah and it's crazy.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.740]   The only cooling in the entire thing is two 120mm fans.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.740]   One is a front intake and one is a CPU.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.740]   It'll be nice if you want it.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.740]   This will be very quiet.
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.740]   So it's really quiet.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:40.540]   You can barely hear it but it's got all these tops back components in.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.300]   So it's a really really really nice system now of course.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:49.860]   Nothing is ever spot on and Dell has done some really retarded things.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:56.300]   Like the memory that you can spec with it is absolutely terrible.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:04.700]   The top price memory is actually slower than the level below because if you want it you
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.860]   want to say two gigs around and you want it in two sticks you can upgrade at a later
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.860]   time.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.860]   Right.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:13.340]   They don't offer memory that's fast enough for the process.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.340]   You end up with just this really weird...
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.340]   It's not DDR2.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:22.140]   It is DDR2 but it's a speed grade below what you'd put with 2G0 chip.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.420]   So you have really really slow memory for some bizarre reason.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.420]   You need to do that.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:34.060]   If you want the faster memory you've got to step down to just one gigabyte which is absolutely
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.580]   ridiculous considering you can go and buy fast memory into gigapast.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.660]   What memory speed are we talking about here?
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.140]   DDR2 800.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:48.620]   Which is on the site they show the 667.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.460]   Yeah exactly.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.460]   Which is...
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.460]   Customize it can't you?
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.220]   Yeah but you can't customize it with 800.
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.580]   If you want stuff that's actually fast enough for the cool did you you've got to go out
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.580]   and buy your own.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.140]   Which seems really silly.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.300]   That's how we Apple people have been doing it all along.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.060]   So it's a good base system but they do...
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.140]   I'm not looking at the option where you can get it without memory.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.900]   You have to get some memory.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.780]   Yeah so you just buy like 512 and throw it out.
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:21.540]   Hey what memory prices are you keeping your memory prices are going to go up.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.540]   Is that imminent?
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.540]   Nah.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.180]   It's just going to stay down.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.180]   Oh it does another earthquake or something.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.940]   It used to you know it used to fluctuate.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:34.260]   You seem to have much better control over the pricing in the past and now it's been you
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:36.540]   know it's just low and it's staying low.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.860]   Yeah I've noticed this too.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.860]   There's something yeah.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.860]   Is it because there's so many factories, so many competitors online that they just can't.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.260]   You know I wonder about that myself.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:48.140]   I think about it every so often because you're right it used to be like a wild fluctuation
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.340]   you could buy low and sell high.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.340]   You have to really pay attention yeah.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.140]   But now I think and I think some of it has to do with the fact that there's so many memory
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.140]   options.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:59.660]   If you go to like the Kingston site and you click and you say you want to buy some memory
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.500]   and you go into the they're buying sheets.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.620]   I mean it's like pages after pages of all this specialized memory.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.780]   I mean it's like it's it's almost like a nightmare.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.020]   Last time I got some memory from Kingston I had to send them an email saying here's the
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.700]   machine what's that I put into it because I can't figure it out.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:21.020]   So are we going to have a funeral in February for the Pentium 4.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.580]   That's when it's slated to die.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:24.580]   Good riddance.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.980]   It's dead to me already.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.980]   It's dead to me.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   You're dead to me.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.140]   At least those Prescott parts.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.260]   Yeah honest CPU ever made.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   What a flop.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:38.700]   This is I mean amazing to see a company with the quality of engineering of Intel go down
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.340]   such a wrong direction for so long.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.540]   Mom has sold themselves on the I Tanium propaganda.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.460]   That's really fascinating and of course.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:52.660]   You know what's weird about that by the way the I Tanium thing which I always kind of
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.340]   like to follow the sociology of these things.
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:58.140]   They got so many people to sign on immediately when they before they even started designing
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.660]   the chip early on.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.300]   They had all these you know so called strategic partners and they roll out a press conference
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.980]   with everybody from Sond I B M to everybody else saying this is where we're headed.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:12.620]   We're all going with this chip and then you know and then I think Intel not realizing
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.020]   that you know these guys will sign on to anything to get some publicity.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.620]   They believed it.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.660]   So Intel I think bought the whole thing themselves.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.900]   They weren't realizing that this thing was a promotion.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   I don't know.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.700]   So long that burst.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.860]   We hardly knew you.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.660]   Actually we wish we hardly knew you unfortunately.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.740]   We knew you all too well.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.500]   Any other stories any of you wish to cover before we wrap this thing up?
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.340]   My Space magazine.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.340]   They're going to do a magazine.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.100]   Well that makes sense you know market the hell out of it while they can because God knows
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.780]   it can't last much longer.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.180]   Doesn't that just seem really really lame though like a magazine full of all the people
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.940]   on my space that are just.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.940]   Will they have the angles?
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.300]   I don't think it's the first time I'm trying to remember but I'm sure there are other websites
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:05.020]   that have tried to make this jump to a magazine.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.420]   It's just a name one.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.940]   Well Yahoo Yahoo at it.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.340]   That's right Yahoo Internet life.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   There you go.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   Right.
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.980]   But I mean why would you even want to I mean a magazine is going to have a circulation
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:20.260]   of what maybe like a hundred thousand people for a real successful magazine.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.180]   Rupert Murdoch that's what he understands.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.420]   You'll probably have a page six girl.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   He's a print guy.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:31.500]   Well it's funny you say that because FHM magazine in the UK had just run an article on
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.460]   the girls in MySpace featuring some MySpace girls in Scandaly Cloud.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.060]   What is the nexus of Scandaly Cloud women and gadgets?
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.620]   I don't understand that.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.140]   I can't buy a British gadget magazine without being faced with people in the peenies.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.380]   I don't get it.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   It's great isn't it?
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380]   No it's not.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.740]   Great I'm a married man I should be looking at this stuff.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:56.380]   Is it true that there's some like if you like gadgets you like you like because you're
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.900]   like peenies what is the deal?
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:04.180]   It's just it's just men and men like technology men like women but women buy gadgets.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.380]   Yeah but they get why is it there are any female gadget magazines out there are how
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.220]   would you feel if there were and there were a magazine which showed iPods and guys in
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.740]   in in Speedo's surely that's just Cosmo.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.500]   Maybe you're right.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:23.820]   For from what I'm told so you like so so what's your complaint here Leo I just I want
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.380]   to read a gadget magazine without feeling like I'm I have to hide it behind a book when
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.300]   I get on the airplane.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.900]   That's just a self confidence issue you can get it.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.220]   Alright maybe that's my problem.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.420]   Maybe it's not a universal issue I'm just just asking that's all.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.380]   I thank you for showing up everybody I'm sorry that we didn't get Patrick on he was coming
