[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.360]   The man who will never appear on NSFW's album art
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.640]   is in studio with me right now, Justin Robert Young.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200]   Juries here from the NSFW show.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.480]   I am on the album art.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.840]   I'm just hiding behind Brian.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.400]   Exactly.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   I'm howering behind.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   People think you're not on the album art.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.720]   I am.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.120]   You are.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.880]   He also does a great to show at WeirdThings.com.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.360]   Yep.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.240]   Full of WeirdThings.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.080]   Yeah, WeirdThings.com and WeirdThings.com
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.640]   with Brian and my friend Andrew Maine.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.880]   But check it out, WeirdThings.com.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.480]   That's awesome.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.320]   Also joining us, the Scobolizer, my old friend Robert Scobol,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.800]   from Half Moon Bay, California, via building43.com.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.320]   What's up?
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.960]   And your new studio-- well, it's not new,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.200]   but you got to know me.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.880]   I keep improving little things.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.200]   I got backdrop paper now over here.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   It looks nice.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040]   And I got a huge yes TV that's going to go up on the wall
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.480]   over here.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   So I'm doing a studio upgrade, just like you guys are.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.680]   Well, and you're doing-- I noticed, in fact,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.280]   I want to talk to you about one of these videos you did.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.200]   But you're doing more and more of the building43 videos there.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.040]   Yeah, well, it's a lot easier to do videos than--
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.560]   Big them come to you.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.040]   Make them come to you.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.520]   That's my motto.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   And if you can't--
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.760]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.840]   By the way, when I was walking around Disneyland last week,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.120]   several people came up to me and go,
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.040]   you hear that guy who's always on Twitch.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   Really nice guy.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960]   With all the things you do, that's what they remember.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.400]   Oh, man.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.360]   That's awesome.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.560]   Scobel and I go way back.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.000]   He used to run my chat room when I did a radio show in San Francisco.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   1990, was it 4?
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.120]   '95?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   They had chat rooms then?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.760]   Way back.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.560]   That's back when you were writing for a Gannett.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.480]   Oh, man.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.200]   Possett.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.840]   Possett.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.240]   That's right.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.960]   Possett and that.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.800]   Also joining us, I'm so glad to have him back.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.280]   And this time, he's got his own headset.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.760]   And I love it, Ome Malek from gigaohm.com,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.680]   sounding and looking good, Ome.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.280]   So your headset, Leo.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.440]   We sent you that headset.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   And you just didn't want to use it, ever.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.840]   Yeah, you know, kind of.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.800]   I'm not a big headset guy.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.240]   You sound so much better, though.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   I appreciate you doing that.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.840]   No, anything for you, Leo.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.920]   Thank you for having me back.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, it's great to have you back.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I've got a great panel.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   Especially if I can give Robert some golf.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.920]   I thought it'd be good pairing.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.680]   Perfect way to spend my Sunday, right?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.600]   People don't understand that we carefully
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.360]   think about every Twitter episode and who we have on it.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   It's like wine and cheese.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.640]   Sure.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   Robert and--
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.360]   I think Ome is a good Pinot Noir, maybe in 1998, Pinot.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.520]   Maybe an Opus 1.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   A little bit of an earthy flavor.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.120]   Right, earthy flavor.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.440]   And then I think of Robert Scobel as kind of that--
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.360]   what is that stinky cheese that you put to pepper?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   Not brie.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.600]   Soft.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   No, much stick here.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   You're good at maybe.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.640]   Anyway, it's good to have you all here.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.360]   And just real quickly, if you've decided
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.480]   that this isn't the show for you and you're watching live,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.960]   don't worry.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.000]   You could still tune in the Mario Marathon 4.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.120]   It's going on right now on Ustream.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.720]   Watch that.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160]   There's some people.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   They're drawing pictures on their head.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.960]   They're playing Mario.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.600]   And they've raised $61,000.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Those guys are amazing.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.440]   They also do the Desert Bus for Hope charity every year.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   And they do these video game marathons.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.760]   They're amazing.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.960]   But they raise money for a good cause.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.280]   I only show this to show you that there is, in fact,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   a show more annoying than Twitter.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.680]   Now, this is good.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   I wanted to give them a plug.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.000]   And by the way, just for those in the chair room,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.440]   they were wondering where my place in the metaphor
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.800]   of the wine and cheese, I'm a warmed over can of Paps Blue
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.280]   Ribbon.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.400]   And after some reason, it's not off around.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.240]   Off in the corner.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.480]   I like it.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.440]   I like it.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.560]   And I'm a piece of ham.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   So it all works.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.960]   It works so very well.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.080]   You did a very interesting-- there
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   are some really interesting technology news.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.920]   We don't very often get big innovations coming at us.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.560]   A lot of times they are seemingly innovations,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.040]   like the SED TVs that we were all excited about some years ago.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.480]   And it never, never happened.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   But there were a couple of announcements this week
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.840]   that I thought were very interesting.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   One is this new camera that apparently
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.080]   has multiple lenses and multiple pickups in it
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.840]   and allows you to refocus the image on any point in the image.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.320]   Have any of you actually seen this?
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.080]   Yeah, I got a tour of this back in 2007
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.240]   when it was a Stanford lab project.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.800]   They're putting a grid of micro lenses over the sensor.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   And they're bending the light to hit different pixels.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   And then the processing takes place
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.080]   and takes only the fourth pixel.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.800]   And that'll be one focus point.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.320]   And the fifth pixel will be another focus point.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.960]   And it's pretty damn cool.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.840]   It's L-Y-T-R-O, the LITRO light field camera.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.640]   That's the technology they call it, light field technology.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.480]   You look at something like this, and I'm always
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.840]   a little bit skeptical.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.560]   Oh, come on.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.400]   We'll get one, and there's going to be something wrong with it.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.600]   There's always a catch.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.200]   There's always a catch.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   There is a catch.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.680]   What's the catch?
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.480]   You give up a little resolution.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.880]   If you have a Canon 5D with a 22 megapixel camera in there,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   you're going to get one quarter of the resolution on that sensor.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.880]   Because they're taking four of the pixels
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.600]   and putting a little lens over it.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.440]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.240]   That's the catch.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.920]   You give up a little bit of resolution
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.880]   to be able to refocus the picture anytime after you take it.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   I'll tell you what I'm really excited for with something
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.200]   like this, though, is when this kind of technology comes
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.960]   to where we're seeing the most input on sites like Flickr,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.760]   which is phones.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.600]   So the number one camera on Flickr is an iPhone 4.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.240]   Absolutely.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.560]   I mean, this is a super cool innovation,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.960]   but I don't know how much it's really going to get its due
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.520]   until it gets to a more consumer level where--
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.760]   Could you put this in a phone?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   You can see this in phones.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.920]   I expect to see this in phones.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.200]   You can or you can't?
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.680]   You cannot, because in order to put this thing,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.760]   the phone size has to increase tremendously.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.680]   The depth of the phone.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.560]   The depth of the phone.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.520]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.400]   Because they're putting the lenses and taking away pixels.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.760]   Right.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.360]   There's a lot of stuff which--
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.160]   there's a lot of press about this company
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.320]   over the last four or five days.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.680]   But not many people understand this aspect of it,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.600]   that they needed a dedicated camera to get the technology rolled
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.800]   out.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.120]   It's not just a lens.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.240]   I mean, it's a big unit.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.680]   No, and it's a software play.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.800]   I mean, it is also--
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.680]   there is a certain kind of software
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.720]   which is getting embedded in your Facebook streams
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.320]   and all those kind of stuff.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.600]   So it is not as easy as it seems.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.560]   I think it's a great technology.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.280]   Not a first-tone.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.600]   But I mean, everyone in Wi-Fi modem was this big.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   I saw the first prototypes.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.400]   And now it's a quarter of an eighth of an inch or something
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.840]   on your little cell phone.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.680]   Aren't these going to be miniaturized?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.400]   And the processor is going to be miniaturized
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.280]   so that they eventually can get into a device
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.480]   the size of the phone?
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.360]   So a couple of things there, Robert,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.560]   you talk about the Wi-Fi.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.360]   The companies which came out at that early days--
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.520]   remember, Lucint or Enoco Wi-Fi?
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.200]   Where are they?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.560]   They don't make money.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.400]   The guys who make money were at Theros who made Chip's Edge.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.280]   And now they're part of Qualcomm.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.680]   They took a few years for companies
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.880]   to start making money off this Wi-Fi technology.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.080]   And I think same thing is with this company.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.200]   They may have a great technology.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.520]   There is a big difference between what is technology
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.000]   and what is a business.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   And I think that is an issue.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.000]   There is another company out there.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.880]   You should look them up.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.000]   And I wrote about them about six months ago or something
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.280]   called Pelican.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.880]   And they have a slightly different approach
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.920]   to doing similar kind of tricks.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.400]   But they were optimizing their experience entirely
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.960]   around the mobile phones and making mobile phones
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.840]   with higher megapixels, higher quality,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.000]   and a much thinner phone.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.040]   So I think my view is that any technology which has to succeed
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.800]   has to succeed inside the phone, not as a standalone camera.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   I think the era of standalone camera is gone.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.240]   Now, we're just like--
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   Well, there's always going to be a market for it.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.000]   But I'm totally on team home here.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.880]   That's where you're going to get the most use.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   And people are going to see it a lot.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.120]   And the technology is going to be understood by the mainstream.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.680]   I'm still taking my 5D to the shuttle launch.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.720]   I'm not going to take that much.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.920]   Yeah, if you go to a shuttle launch.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.520]   But this is interesting.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.040]   Look at this.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.520]   This is the Pelican that I was talking about.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.880]   That fits inside a smart tool.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.480]   So Robert, I think the key thing is just as there
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.120]   are people who still write with an ink pen.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.480]   And there are still people who get their clothes made bespoke.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.880]   There is going to be people who will
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.320]   buy dedicated cameras.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.040]   But that market isn't that huge as it seemed like maybe five,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.360]   six years ago.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.400]   And I totally agree with you.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.480]   And if I was going to buy a camera that was going to carry
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.560]   around, I'd probably buy a DSLR that had the high resolution
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.720]   and still put up with the focusing.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.800]   Yeah, it's not so hard to focus.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.680]   And you know, the reason--
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.640]   I don't see this--
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   Yes, I'll argue.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.800]   I'm renting a 600 millimeter lens from Kibil and Shekit
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.480]   in Palo Alto.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   And you can go to--
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.180]   Right.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.520]   And you can go to the whole bunch of lens rental places.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   This is an $8,000 lens.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.440]   But these come--
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.520]   It doesn't work on this camera.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.540]   These companies are not meant for the professional photographer
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.240]   or even the prosumer like you.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.200]   But the vast majority of photography
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.000]   is done by people who are taking snapshots of their kids,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.200]   snaps of their dog.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.680]   They're out of focus.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.480]   The dog moved.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.920]   And I think if you get this in a form factor,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.800]   in a phone size form--
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   But I think--
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.480]   But I think--
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.720]   You'll nail it.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.920]   The camera in your phone is good enough.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.020]   That are people going to carry around a separate camera.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.540]   People complain, though.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.100]   No, I agree.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.900]   I think you're right.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.420]   I don't think people will.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.980]   I think that right now they've already-- we see it.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.260]   That's why we see it on Flickr.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.700]   But they always complain about how slow the camera is
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.740]   to take a picture.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.900]   They're putting up with it.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.900]   It's convenience over quality.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.340]   And this isn't an ideal situation.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.300]   Well, let me ask this, because I'm not super
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.140]   up on the text specifically on this.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.860]   But could you simulate what's going on software-wise
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.720]   by taking multiple photos at multiple points,
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.960]   like digital HDR does?
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.380]   I mean, could you--
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.620]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.860]   But my baby, by that point, would have moved.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.140]   Well, hopefully do one of the points in which the picture
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.100]   is taken over if you're taking multiple pictures, right?
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.740]   And then only--
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.560]   Yeah, there's another, I think, very important point,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.900]   which is you can't just look at these pictures on a website.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.100]   You have to have playback software.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.300]   It doesn't just go on Facebook.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.620]   Although you could, as a photographer, decide
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.500]   that's the focus point.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.460]   And then image it.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.260]   And capture that.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.220]   Yeah, render it out.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.860]   Well, I think we also have to think in terms
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.060]   of how, as a society, we don't really care about a lot of things.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.500]   And one of those things is just taking pictures
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.940]   and just uploading them, because we don't really
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.420]   think a lot about storage space anymore.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.580]   We just kind of-- you can take a lot of pictures on your phone.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.100]   And pictures are not--
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.220]   they don't have the similar value in our daily life
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.940]   as they used to have when we were kids.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.380]   And somebody would come and take the family portrait.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.060]   Now, pictures are just like sharing experiences
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.300]   on a rapid-fire basis almost in real time.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.580]   I mean, look at the crappy quality of photographs
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.540]   we share on Twitpick and Vyfrock and all things.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.500]   That's true.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.180]   You know, as our idea of what a photo is,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.020]   is changing as rapidly as the technology itself.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.460]   And I think there is a bigger challenge.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.740]   So look, I'm not trying to dis this company, not at all.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.620]   I think any company which tries brave new technology
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.460]   is a good thing for Silicon Valley, especially
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.100]   in a world where we are overrun by group on clones.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.580]   But I really do believe that people
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.460]   need to think in terms of how do you
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.180]   get this technology to market?
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.620]   Like, what is it that is going to put this in millions
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.540]   of people's hands?
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.140]   And I don't know if anybody's going
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.340]   to spend $400, $500 for a dedicated camera, even $200
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.780]   for a dedicated camera.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.100]   Is this another Fovion?
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.660]   Remember, everybody got excited about the Fovion ship
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.980]   that was going to give us such--
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.940]   you know, it was a whole different way.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.020]   Carver me to figure it out, to take pictures.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.220]   And we don't see Fovions anywhere.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.020]   Is it like that?
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.100]   Or is it's-- because it's certainly
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.260]   happened before that we've had these great tech.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.620]   And this is why I wanted to speak.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.660]   This could be because I'm looking at the pictures I shot
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.100]   at the beach today.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.380]   And they have almost infinite depth of field on my iPhone.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.660]   I mean, I'm sitting right next to my son.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.860]   Everything's in focus.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.020]   And so do I feel the pain of focus
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.460]   that I need to go and buy one of these cameras?
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.140]   I don't, myself.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   But maybe somebody does.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.460]   I guess that's the thing is that there's
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.460]   technological leap forward on something that is not
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.340]   aimed at the market that would use it.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.940]   It's an invention that's so cool they couldn't resist it.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.380]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.980]   But it doesn't solve a problem that exists.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.940]   Oh, when you're busy for a lot more than people
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.940]   that would not buy it.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.900]   What can I want to ask somebody that nobody else does?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.260]   But--
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.060]   Look, I'm with you on that, Robert.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.140]   I am going to spend money on this camera
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.780]   whenever it comes to market if nothing just
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.220]   to support the company.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.740]   I mean, you've got to support the tech,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.460]   especially people who are trying new technology.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.220]   You need that kind of innovation.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.020]   Trey Ratcliffe told me he's--
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.740]   He's got one.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.180]   He's going to get one.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.500]   He got one because he was not sure.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   He said that he was going to pick it up in San Francisco.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.100]   He's hoping to have it for the launch.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.860]   OK.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.700]   We're going to use that to make different kinds of images
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.820]   inside the building and stuff like that where you can refocus.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.700]   And there it might make sense as a documentary kind of thing
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.820]   where you need a little bit different kinds of technology.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.060]   But for the shuttle launch itself,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.100]   I'm not going to use that camera because it's going to be--
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.140]   It's not going to have a good enough lens
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.700]   because we're forced to be about half a mile away
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.540]   from the shuttle launch.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.340]   So I'm going to have a 600 millimeter lens.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.140]   No, you know what?
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.620]   You're not going to take a camera-- a picture
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.340]   because you're going to be standing next to Trey Ratcliffe.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.460]   He's just going to be killing it right next to you.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.980]   We're going to bring all sorts of gear.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.180]   We're going to have a lot of fun.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.260]   Yeah, but I'm just saying, anybody who takes a picture
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.060]   from the same vantage point as Trey Ratcliffe
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.180]   is just asking for trouble.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.460]   Exactly.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.340]   He's going to be showing everything like, oh, I got this.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:09.820]   I got this.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.980]   You want to see my picture?
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.540]   I got some--
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:11.860]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.820]   You're a picture, Robert.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.580]   I got some gums, fucking the lens.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.580]   I'm going to be filming the lens.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.460]   He uses some of that stuff.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.860]   I'm telling you, if you saw the pictures--
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.060]   Believe me, I'm going-- it's like a college level course.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.700]   And no, it is.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:22.980]   H.E.R.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.140]   Patrick is hanging out with the guy for an hour.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.620]   OK.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.900]   I promise that as soon as Trey can review that camera,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.180]   he will do it on our Twitter photo show
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.500]   because he's regular on the show,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.940]   and I cannot wait to see.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.180]   And I can't wait to see his pictures from the launch.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.380]   He did some great pictures of the last launch.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.700]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.780]   I led with this story.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.540]   And I'll tell you why, because for the same reason,
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.260]   you're going to buy this, I want to support these guys.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.420]   I think this is exciting.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.620]   And then there's another technology
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.060]   that you kind of broke, Robert, at Building43.com.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.580]   You got one right there, don't you?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.940]   Well, they left me one of the explanations
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.300]   of how this technology works.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.980]   So this is the video that you shot
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.060]   if you go to Building43.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.940]   I'll let me show this, and then you could show us the light.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.220]   But the idea is--
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.700]   You change the LCD panel, the LED behind it.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.620]   Those are the same, but you change the way
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.060]   that the light gets to the LCD panel.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.380]   And that's what this shows.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:20.940]   If you see--
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.780]   So he's using a standard gallium arsenide LED
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.260]   to light these fluorescent tubes.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.300]   They're efflorescents in different colors.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.100]   Yeah, same color light, same blue light.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.020]   But as it goes through the materials that bring the light
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.380]   to your monitor, to your eye, the better
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.180]   you do those materials, the richer the color.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.940]   So what they did, they came out to my house,
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.060]   and they had two iPads, one with the standard iPad 2
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.300]   monitor that mine has in it.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.540]   Unfortunately, you can't tell on the YouTube video.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.860]   You really can't.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.340]   But when you see it, it's stunning.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.700]   I mean, they put a red tomato up, and it's like, oh,
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.300]   holy shit, that's cool.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.140]   So what I gathered from the video
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.540]   is the color is more true.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.460]   It's not just more true.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.780]   It's deeper.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.260]   It's red.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.820]   When you see the tomato on the old iPad,
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.300]   it's a little bit orange.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.020]   And when you see it on this new technology, it's red.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.220]   It's beautiful.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.060]   So did they say--
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.860]   It's like my first saw, cut a chrome film.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.700]   It's like, wow, that's more like nice.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.220]   This is nice, bright color.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.780]   What do you mean--
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.500]   This is the greens of summer.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.180]   Yes.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.220]   Considering how much these monitors have kind of been
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.900]   a race to the bottom in terms of price,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.260]   and that's how they've exploded,
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.780]   even price feasible right now?
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.420]   Yeah, they said the technology is about the same price
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.460]   is what it costs right now.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.300]   So they said there won't be any increase in price.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.660]   The battery life won't see any increase in battery life,
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.740]   although they said it will increase over future technologies
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.980]   because future technologies you could get maybe 10% more
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.100]   battery life by using a technology that doesn't have the color.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.620]   And I think that's why they came out to my house was to--
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.380]   You have to say it.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.820]   Spark a conversation. Do consumers want these really hyper-rich
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.300]   screens versus another 20 minutes of battery life
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.140]   on their iPad?
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.780]   I think so.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.220]   Yeah, by the way, everybody you had me cursing first
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.220]   on this episode of "To It," you have lost your bet.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.900]   Yes, please.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.540]   Return the money to your office pool.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.100]   Robert Scobel, that's cursed first.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.260]   I now have a bet that J.R.Y will never curse.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.060]   There we go.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.100]   That's why we got it.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.660]   Don't jinx the perfect game, Liam.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.180]   Yeah, I know.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.460]   So this is the company.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.860]   And I did want to ask you, Robert, because you saw it in person.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.220]   It's nanosis.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.140]   Did they say that they're talking to Apple?
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.500]   They didn't say I tried 30 ways to get out of them.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.100]   Who their first customer is going to be?
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.820]   And they wouldn't say, what's really interesting is today,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.940]   I just learned from this VC, and I forget her name.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.740]   I'll find it out, that there's another company that
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.220]   has even better technology in the wings.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.220]   And so there's going to be a fight over these new monitors,
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.740]   which is really exciting.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.100]   And I can't wait to get one of these new Hyper-Real LED
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.700]   monitors.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.620]   It's one of the things that's really
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.260]   great about the tech sphere and its fun to cover tech,
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.460]   is you never really know where the next innovation's coming
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.660]   from.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.740]   And when Apple came out with a Retina display on the iPhone,
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.740]   I think that suddenly started a race.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.820]   That could end up with super hyper realistic displays.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.060]   Keep in mind, the technology I saw
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   was on the same resolution display.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   So they said, if you put this behind a double pixel display,
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.180]   a Retina kind of display, you'll see both the higher
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.180]   resolution and the better color.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   When I saw this, when they brought it to my house,
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.700]   I was like, man, is that the Retina display?
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.500]   Because it looked sharper.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.780]   And they said, no, it's no difference resolution.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.660]   It was just better light coming through the LEDs.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.740]   So the colors were richer.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.780]   And the blacks were richer.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.860]   And the reds and the greens and the blues.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.340]   I mean, it was just-- oh my god.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.420]   When you see them side by side, it's like, oh my god.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.660]   In fact, you were at the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.700]   Did you go by the LG booth, Leo?
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.740]   I did.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.140]   Did you see the monitor that they were saying
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.580]   this is a futuristic technology that's coming sometime?
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.660]   Was it the 4K monitor, the big 4K display?
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.700]   No, they had a monitor there that had much richer color.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.980]   And that was a prototype of the nanosis technology.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.780]   Oh, really?
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.860]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.380]   No.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.380]   No.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   Robert, did you--
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.820]   I saw it and I didn't notice it.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.780]   Did you get any indication on what kind of production
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.980]   they'd be able to go into on that?
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.300]   I said, can you make me 100 million of these?
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.380]   And they did not blink.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:32.860]   So--
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.660]   Really?
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.700]   I mean, because that seems to be--
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.580]   That's because they knew you couldn't buy 100 million.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.820]   They're like, oh, yeah, no.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.620]   We can do a billion.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.140]   OK.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.580]   How many do you want, Robert?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.180]   This was how I was trying to get out of them.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.380]   Are you talking to Apple?
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.300]   Because I know Apple's going to sell 100 million iPads
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.820]   next year.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.700]   So that's been Apple's big thing with the iPhones
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.020]   and the iPads is just component production, right?
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.380]   They said they can make craplodes of it.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.660]   And by the way, it's made in Silicon Valley.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.220]   It's not a--
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.660]   It's American.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.140]   They're not going to make it in China.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.300]   They said the process of making this stuff
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.980]   and the ability for them to make a lot of it
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.540]   is pretty easy.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.100]   And you can automate most of the factory.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.860]   So they don't care about the lower people costs
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.340]   of going to the east.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.700]   Do you want to see how beautiful that tomato can look?
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.900]   You better buy American.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.900]   All right.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.740]   Whoever puts this in the tablet first
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.300]   is going to get me to buy their tablet.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:26.780]   No kidding.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.820]   Well, if you want to crack and wrote that gray--
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.500]   If you want to crack and crack and crack and crack and crack
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.860]   on a future trip, you better have one of these screens.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.380]   Gary McCracken wrote that great article on this technology
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.100]   as your blog about iPads and the iPad clones saying,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.220]   I think, a very important point.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.180]   Why should I buy this instead of an iPad?
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.500]   And nobody has anything compelling,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.700]   but that could be exactly what it takes.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.340]   Yeah, and I was down at the Visio headquarters
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.780]   and asked them about it.
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.340]   And they're still questioning, do people
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.220]   want these hyper-real screens?
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.060]   They said sometimes the colors can be too saturated.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.860]   And I said, I've seen it.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.060]   I put my own photos.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.260]   I want one.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.340]   So put it in there.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.780]   Otherwise, you guys are going to be looking really lame when
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.420]   there's a screen next to it.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.620]   By the way, they can make this for a huge LED--
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.340]   65, 75 inch LED monitors.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.380]   So all monitors--
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.420]   this company predicts all monitors will have a technology
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.020]   like this within 24 months.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.860]   Someday, oh, monitors will look this way.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.660]   We're going to take a break.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.020]   I wanted to lead with two innovations, just
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.380]   because it's exciting.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.100]   That's why we're in technology.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.660]   Two very exciting innovations.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.140]   Now we get to the meat of the matter.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.060]   The FTC is investigating Google.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.460]   We've got more hacks, but also word
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.060]   that Lolsec is retiring.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.020]   A Lolsec arrest could have anything to do with that.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.900]   The Winklevise dropped their lawsuit, then bring it back.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.060]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.900]   But that's all coming up in just a bit first.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.340]   And smoke them if you got them, guys.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.660]   We're going to take a little break and--
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.740]   I don't know why.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.580]   I just assumed you would probably--
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.460]   Sure, you saw the new warning.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:05.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.860]   No, we're going to have the--
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.220]   It goes on.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.700]   Yeah, it goes on.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.460]   Seriously?
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.460]   OK, I'm going to go blow up your butt real quick.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.380]   Those new warning, they have those--
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.340]   In Canada.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.900]   In Canada.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.500]   And it doesn't stop any, but--
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.620]   No, not at all.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.020]   I watch people-- young people, people I worked with when
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.900]   I was up there in Toronto doing a show.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.020]   And they'd go out and they'd buy a carton of cigarettes
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.260]   with horrendous images of people with no jaw and gum
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.060]   diseases.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.420]   And they go, yeah, whatever.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.820]   I mean, I've never been a smoker,
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.940]   but when I was in college, I went to go to Montreal
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.020]   in Toronto every once in a while.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.300]   And I would always buy a pack of cigarettes
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.460]   just because they look so metal.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.500]   They're so horrible.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.020]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.060]   So we're going to get those pretty much the same pictures
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.020]   on our cigarettes soon.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.540]   Sure.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.140]   Now, finally.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.980]   We can import that.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.740]   That'll stop them.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   That'll stop smokers.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.300]   We'll also talk about Final Cut Pro 10
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.380]   and what's wrong with it or what's right with it.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.700]   I got it.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.340]   I got it too.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.220]   We all got it.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.500]   The question is, do we want to keep it?
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:58.780]   But we'll--
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.260]   [GASPS]
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.260]   [GASPS]
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.260]   [GASPS]
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.260]   [GASPS]
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.740]   I'm going to punch his button.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.620]   He can't say a thing now.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.620]   He's silenced.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.820]   While I talk about the good people at Citrix
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.540]   and go to my PC--
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.700]   Yes, go to my PC.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.780]   It's the best way to access your computer remotely, Mac,
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.100]   or PC from anywhere.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.900]   If you're-- you know, holidays are here.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.060]   The vacation time is here.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.100]   I know you're going to be going away somewhere.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.380]   And you're probably a little nervous.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.420]   I know-- I always get nervous leaving the business behind
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.420]   because I don't want to miss that critical email that offer
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   to buy, twit, for a half a billion dollars.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.620]   It would be a shame to miss that email.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.740]   And to be honest, the worst thing
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.500]   is you come home to 1,000 messages in your inbox.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.220]   So whenever I am away, I like to log into my computer
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.500]   and kind of clear out the inbox.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.740]   This is what GoToMyPC is so great for.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.460]   And for people who want to avoid a commute,
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.740]   they want to work home one day a week,
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.620]   they want to travel without the worry about what they're missing.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.900]   This is a great solution.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.180]   In fact, you can get it for 30 days right now,
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.300]   just in time for vacation.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.820]   Go to go to myPC.com.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.940]   Use the offer code, twit, 30 days free.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.620]   You can put it on your Mac or your PC,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.820]   and then wherever you go, even an open access point,
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.180]   you log in your GoToMyPC account with your secure password.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.420]   You're connected via 128-bit SSL, so it's completely private,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.900]   even on an open Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.540]   And there you are.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.660]   You're on your office computer.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.620]   You can run any program.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.740]   You can send and receive email.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.500]   You can access any network resources just like you're there.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.860]   In fact, you can even do it with your iPad.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.420]   And that is an amazing thing to be running a Windows machine
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.500]   on an iPad.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.460]   It is fantastic.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.980]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.620]   You'll find a lot of ways to use it.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.180]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.140]   Click the try free button.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.340]   Use the offer code, twitted.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.260]   It is fantastic.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.220]   And we really--
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.340]   sincerely, we thank our friends at Citrix, who
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.620]   are such great supporters.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.340]   I said we want to have a parade from the old studio.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.380]   The world's shortest parade from the old studio
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.020]   to the new studio.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.940]   And they said, we'd like to sponsor that.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.660]   So really?
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.220]   I actually drive by the Citrix building
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.940]   on my way to work in South Florida.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.740]   Oh, in South Florida?
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.980]   There's a Citrix building.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.900]   I always look at there and I go, those are the folks.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.420]   That's right.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.460]   They used to do go to my piece.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:17.740]   That's right.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.980]   The big Citrix was in like Boca, near Boca?
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.900]   Yeah, just out of the Boca.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.340]   And I forgot about that.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.500]   Popping up the beach area.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.340]   So Lolsec.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.540]   Yes.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.900]   Sailing off.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.660]   Are they?
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.140]   That's what they say.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.420]   So apparently, earlier this week, British authorities
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.180]   arrested a 19-year-old kid, a kid, Ryan Clary, who people now
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.340]   say-- well, Lolsec, first of all, said he's not a big shot.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.220]   He just ran one of our many IRC servers.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.780]   Others are saying this kid has Asperger's syndrome.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.340]   The British Serious Organized Crime Agency,
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.740]   Soka, went after him because he hacked or somebody hacked Soka.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.900]   And they got him.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.220]   Lolsec said it ain't us.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   It's just a minion.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.380]   But then, shortly thereafter, Lolsec says--
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.740]   and by the way, we're retiring.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.340]   Well, they also said it was a planned 50-day voyage that
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.540]   has now come to an end.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.780]   And they will cease the Lols, at least as Lolsec security.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.980]   They might filter into other organizations like an honest.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.100]   And where did they announce this end of their voyage?
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   The pirate bay.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.100]   The pirate bay.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.340]   They're sailing off into the sunset.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.740]   Goodbye there.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.060]   And yeah, and then they did it with a parting shot, I guess,
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.460]   a few AT&T passwords and logins and information.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.900]   So they went out with a bang, those Lolsec kids.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.540]   But it's very, very interesting to see what--
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:49.300]   they had a little bit of a keener kind of PR for their stuff
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.500]   than some other hacking operations have.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.140]   And that's how anonymous has always gotten attention.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.060]   But they had that little rye, wink and a nod,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.860]   sense of humor, even when they were doing things that--
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.420]   I think it's the monopoly guy.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.220]   Yes.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.140]   Oh, no, it was secret to their success.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.820]   It was the why you know guy.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.260]   Yeah, I love the monopoly monocle.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.140]   It's very-- it's interesting to see
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.540]   what the general reaction is to these kind of hacking things.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:25.060]   And then as it gets more serious, when morally,
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.580]   they're just all over the place.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.060]   It was a completely anti-security, amoral,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   anti-security.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.300]   Well, they hacked Sony because they didn't like them,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.540]   but they didn't hack Sega because they liked the Dreamcast.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.460]   It's like--
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.060]   Exactly.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   I didn't know this, but a Nick Pilton's article in the New
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.180]   York Times where he talks about the fact
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.300]   that they're retiring, he says there's six of them.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.020]   Did we know that there's only six of them?
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.900]   Is that?
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.740]   I don't know.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.780]   I mean, Gawker had an interview with one of them.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.300]   And it's-- with a situation like this,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.740]   I mean, if you were a reporter reporting on this,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.420]   I would defer to Robert Scobel and Om
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.860]   to comment on this since they're actual journalists.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.220]   And I'm just a weiner talking into a microphone.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.740]   Hey, don't knock weiners talking in the microphones, baby.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.940]   I may live in that way.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.100]   But obviously, you're going to get any information
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.900]   on this from these guys unless you have some sort of law
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.420]   enforcement person who's tracking them telling you stuff.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.940]   But what can you believe from somebody who says they're
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.620]   in Lolsac, even if you have a reasonable idea?
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.540]   So what do you think, Om?
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.460]   Is this real?
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.180]   Is this another lull?
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.660]   Believe it or not, I actually have no opinion on this.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   No.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.260]   Why not?
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.340]   Why not?
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.940]   What about Lols in general?
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.220]   I didn't really follow the story.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.860]   You're not into hacking, huh?
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.300]   You know, this is part of our online life.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.500]   Things are going to happen.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.620]   And you know, look, I'm not an expert on this stuff,
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.140]   so I'm just going to shut up.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.180]   Well, we can get Kim Polson on to talk about her
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.420]   in the lawnmower or somebody.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.700]   You guys know more about this stuff.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.180]   Well, I think jury is a hacker.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.460]   I think he's in Lolsac.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.180]   I cannot confirm nor deny that I've ridden the boat.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.020]   The Lolsac boat.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.860]   How about you, Robert?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.940]   You must know something about this.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.020]   No.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.020]   No.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.420]   Nobody knows anything about this.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.220]   You know, I'm hung around with enough hackers today.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.460]   No, not to say anything about them.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.540]   That's what it really is.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   That's what Ohm's smart.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.780]   He's saying, Oh, I don't know anything about them.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.900]   Oh, doesn't want them to even think about, you know,
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.060]   aiming their--
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.700]   I really don't know.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.100]   No, seriously, I just have not--
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.300]   like, you know, and I try not to talk about things
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.300]   I have no clue about.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   So--
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.140]   I have no clue about a lot of their work.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.140]   So I--
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.900]   I have no clue about it.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   I have no clue about it.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.740]   I'm starting to talk and do it.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.180]   Well, I mean, the only thing is, in terms of them,
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.500]   what I think got them as much attention as they have
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.180]   is they kept hitting on things that are in the zeitgeist
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.020]   of popular culture.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.540]   And at the end of the day, what we will most remember them
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.140]   for is when they hacked PBS and put the Tupac Shakur
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.980]   is alive in Brazil.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.260]   That was so awesome.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.380]   And that's the thing is, you know, we look at that
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.740]   and like, sure, if we all sat down and said,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.700]   the security matter, do we want to support an organization
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.060]   that is their only goal is to destabilize any measure
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.220]   of security put on in the internet?
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   You would say, well, of course, I don't support that.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.060]   But at the same time, if somebody puts up
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.300]   the Tupac's kick in it in Auckland,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.540]   we're like, that's hilarious.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.700]   And I also think that one of the reasons it's interesting
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.580]   is because they, unlike most hackers who just
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.660]   seem like people-- you know, vandals, kids who are messing
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.700]   around or people who are just interested in learning
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.060]   how things work, these guys were fairly political.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   And, you know, I think we first learned about them
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.140]   because of their defense of Wikileaks.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.540]   That was the big thing, yeah.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.660]   So I think that that's kind of intriguing, too,
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.340]   that we're seeing hackers act politically.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.900]   Well, you know, the problem with that is, you know,
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.540]   when it comes to them just hacking into the US Senate site
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.700]   and getting usernames and passwords, it's one thing.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.660]   If you get into national security and, you know,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   if they go and because politically they are anti-are
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.980]   incursion into Libya, you know, we
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.300]   need to answer for the fact that, you know, this group
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.980]   has compromised a military effort
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.860]   and put American lives in jeopardy, which is not great.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.700]   Yeah, and to say--
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.140]   Leo, I remember one of my first celebrities interviews
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.180]   was with Waz back in '89.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.700]   And we talked specifically about this issue.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.380]   And he says it's actually good for society
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.620]   to have people trying to break in stuff like this
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.060]   because it makes these systems more secure over time.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.820]   And that's a compelling argument for me.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.900]   I think it's a larger argument.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.260]   I think it's good for society to have outcasts,
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.500]   to have rebels, to have irritants
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.980]   because that's where innovation happens.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.860]   It doesn't happen from the people who are comfortable
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.700]   and happy and just trucking along doing their thing.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.380]   It happens from people who are on the fringes
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.300]   on the outside.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.740]   This is the kind of irritant--
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.380]   I mean, we don't know what Lull's Sec will spawn or create.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.020]   And I admit that there are, you know, moral issues about,
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.940]   you know, loss of life associated with information
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.820]   they release.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.420]   And yet I think society needs people like this
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.020]   to stir things up.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.060]   And I kind of feel like that's what they think too.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.580]   That's why they are in it for the Lulls.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.340]   I don't know if-- and, you know, I have no insight
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.220]   into Lull Sec beyond what everybody else has read and seen.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.660]   But I don't know if they have a super fully formed philosophy.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.740]   Like if they've jotted down their declaration of Lulls.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.180]   No, it seemed to be all over the place, frankly.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.860]   No, it's just like, hey, I can break down this.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.340]   So I'm going to do that.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.060]   And maybe they added the political gloss after the fact.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.060]   Well, I think they have opinions, you know?
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.500]   And I think that they hacked on them.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.140]   You know, what was funny to me is,
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.100]   you know, you had another group that
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.180]   thought that Lulls Sec was getting too much publicity.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.820]   And then there were a bunch of script kitties.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.300]   So they hacked into PBS just to show in a more difficult way.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.180]   It wasn't that hard.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.580]   Yeah, they were as good as they think they are.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.380]   I think that--
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.660]   The other thing is a lot of our future engineers
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.060]   are these kids.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.380]   I mean, I remember Chris Cratham got hired at Facebook
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.740]   because he broke in a Facebook and messed around.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.820]   And Facebook, you know, luckily was smart enough to say,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.020]   hey, this kid's really smart and he's poking around
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.940]   in our systems.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.460]   Why don't we hire him to close all the holes?
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.780]   That tries to normal people crazy because they see a commonly
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.980]   see a path from hacker to highly played computer engineer.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.260]   And then bugs the hell out of them.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.780]   But frankly, if you're Facebook, who better to hire?
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.260]   Well, I mean, for certain things, I mean, there's obviously,
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.980]   if you have a understanding of a certain system,
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.500]   then you can have a unique perspective
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.940]   on advancing that system, not only with security,
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.380]   but also in terms of its build and how people interact with it.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:48.780]   I didn't know.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.140]   Gio Hotz got hired by Facebook too.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.020]   Good for them.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.180]   I love that.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.860]   And Bunny Wong, who hacked the Xbox,
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.660]   is now doing the little chubby thing.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.820]   So it just shows you.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.660]   And what happened with Sony, I think,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.140]   was ultimately a very good thing.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.380]   And for that only, in consumer understanding
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.740]   of what you're going to put online,
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.500]   but also how serious a company like Sony
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.660]   needs to take security.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:17.140]   Well, and Sony just laid off a bunch of security people
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.900]   a couple of weeks before they were hacked.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.700]   Isn't there some just amazing irony in that?
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.740]   They fired out security people.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.980]   This is why I know you never get the attention
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.780]   of the hackers on yourself.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.340]   Because you lay off a bunch of security engineers.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.940]   Well, they know how to break into you.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.300]   We actually--
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.060]   we mentioned that we were talking about this on security now
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.580]   on Wednesday.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.220]   But we--
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.900]   Twit got hacked.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.500]   Really?
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.740]   A very minor hack.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.380]   They were able to change-- we have three servers running
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.340]   live.twit.tv.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.900]   They were able to change a line of code
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.420]   in the jQuery library on one of the three servers.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.420]   And I think we've referred it out.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.140]   I don't know if we have yet found how they got in.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.940]   And I think that's one of the reasons we haven't really
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.300]   gone real public with this.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.740]   Fortunately, there's nothing on that server
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.300]   that's completely isolated.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.420]   If you had a chat login that you were using,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.660]   you might want to change that password.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.220]   Well, and you certainly-- if you were silly enough
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.260]   to use the same password for Twit chat
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.740]   that you used to log into your bank,
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.660]   you might want to change that.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.860]   But other than that, I don't think there was any harm.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.940]   Well, the point being we have very good sysadmins.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.100]   And we are always-- people are always
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.300]   trying to crack into our system.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.740]   So we're very alert.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.820]   We're constantly updating software,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.020]   keeping everything locked down.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.100]   And even with, I think, highly accomplished experts,
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.460]   we still got hacked.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.540]   It's not possible to seal everything down.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.040]   No.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.020]   What percentage of people on your systems
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.140]   use the password password?
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.060]   You know, I haven't looked, but that's a good question.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.140]   You saw that they released--
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.580]   where did those passwords come from?
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.180]   I can't remember.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.660]   But how bad the passwords were--
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.100]   That would be a great Tumblr site.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.340]   Oh, it's terrible when the guys released the data from the PS2.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.900]   That's right.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.660]   People did analysis of that.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.060]   One, two, three, four, five, six was the most popular password.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.420]   The kind of code an idiot puts on their luggage.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.180]   But who cares if they break into your PlayStation account?
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.740]   Really?
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.260]   Now, Tony Blair might care if they break into his electronic
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.660]   address book, Hacker Team Poison.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.420]   Says Tony Blair should be locked up.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.260]   He's a war criminal.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.500]   They're angry about Iraq.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.140]   So they said they're targeting Blair.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:33.340]   And apparently released contact data from his address book,
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.540]   plus a nice ASCII art impression of him.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.060]   Sure.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.820]   Oh, it looks good in the ASCII.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.580]   Here's my favorite part about this story,
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.340]   is that they're like, Tony Blair is a war criminal,
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.740]   and he has murdered civilians.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.780]   And he needs to be tried in World Court,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.580]   which is why we're releasing the number of his dentist.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.100]   Finally!
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   Well, there were some members--
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.100]   This criminal will be brought to justice.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.860]   There were some members of parliament in there as well.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.820]   There were members of parliament,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.140]   and they wound up calling--
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.740]   I guess there was a number for number 10 Downing Street,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.460]   which some members of Gordon Brown's--
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.100]   Oh.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.780]   --got a call, and they're like, is this number 10 Downing Street?
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.420]   Tony's not here anymore.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.540]   I think that's hysterical.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.460]   Yes, CNET called the number in the phone book
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.340]   and talked to an unidentified representative
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.620]   from Gordon Brown's office confirming
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.220]   it was indeed for 10 Downing Street.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.860]   But we have-- I'm sorry, we have no comment on that.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.620]   That's so funny.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:29.740]   And Lolschak hacked the Arizona Department of Public Safety.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.740]   Love that.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   They did that.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.140]   Another FBI consultation firm.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.900]   They actually tried to blackmail him.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.060]   They were emailing back and forth
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.540]   and saying that if he gave up more locations and passwords
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.540]   to other databases and control, it
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.340]   was one of the firms that helps track botnets.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.580]   And Lolschak wanted information on the botnet,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.900]   so I assume when they did their SQL injections
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.500]   into Nala service attacks, they could utilize those.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.060]   They could fold them inside themselves, not unlike Voltron.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.180]   The latest hack, Electronic Arts, says,
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.540]   customer data has been stolen from them, as well.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.060]   Hackers broke into a server hosting the forum for biowares,
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.380]   never winter nights.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.580]   And if your password for never winter nights
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.340]   has been compromised, I have no sympathy.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:23.820]   Come on.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:29.500]   No sympathy for the never winter gamers grinding out.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.980]   And one moment you're drinking Mountain Dew code red,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.660]   the next minute you're getting secure,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.900]   your stuff's out in the street.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.620]   Lolschak is floating it out there on the boat.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.100]   As usual, Electronic Arts says it was a highly sophisticated
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.100]   attack.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.700]   You never say, oh, these are a bunch of script kitties.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:53.140]   Well, and that's what a lot of the other hacker that hacked
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.700]   into the PBS thing was saying, this is strict smashing grab.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.700]   That's what we're doing.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.780]   As you said, he did it because he wanted to show that Lolschak--
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.540]   what's not like that?
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.700]   Yes, exactly.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.020]   I mean, I'm not an expert on hacking,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.540]   but it seems like what Lolschak has done is they found a hook.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.580]   They find things that will get coverage, PBS Frontline
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.380]   documentary on Wikileaks, the US Senate, the Arizona Department
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.020]   of Health and Safety or whatever.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.820]   And they smash and grab information.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.660]   And now all of a sudden, these things that we're already
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.460]   talking about on some level and already have news value,
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.780]   now have another angle to it.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:28.980]   I'll tell you what bugs me.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.500]   And it bugs me because it affected me.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.700]   Tuesday morning, the FBI raided a data center
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.100]   for a Swiss company called Digital One.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.700]   They--
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.580]   The FBI said it was a move to quote,
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.500]   "Thwort international cyber crime rings distributing
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.100]   scareware."
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.540]   Now, not a fan of scareware.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.140]   This is the software that says, you've got viruses, buy our
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.020]   program, and we'll save you.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.700]   And it's a real problem.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.380]   But unfortunately, there was a bunch of blade servers.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.300]   And the FBI apparently couldn't tell one from the other.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.940]   So they took three racks of servers, including Instapaper.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.580]   Not knocked offline because Marco was smart enough to be
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.300]   distributed to various other places.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.540]   But he was slow down a little bit.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.620]   And the delicious replacement that I use,
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.500]   pinboard.in, was off.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.700]   They were running from backups.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.180]   In fact, I think they're still down.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.740]   So really kind of an unfortunate move by the FBI.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.420]   They've not apologized nor explained.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.260]   Although apparently, some of the servers are now back up.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.220]   I think the Instapaper server is back up.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.700]   But this is just, to me, this is a brute force, a blunt
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.660]   instrument.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.380]   And it's just appalling.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.820]   Yeah, here's the only thing that we don't know about this.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.220]   And I was talking to Andrew Maine on the way up here.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.020]   He made the point that we don't know whether it was an
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.780]   FBI thing that they just grab whatever they want.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.220]   Or it was the server, the places where the servers were
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.980]   being held, that when the FBI shows up and says, we need to
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.340]   pull these--
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.660]   They said, well, that's the rack.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.700]   Go just take everything.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.660]   That maybe it's a poor record-caping thing.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.380]   Maybe they just fold in.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.580]   Marco left Digital One.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.660]   He pulled his Instapaper account from there.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.380]   He said, whether it was Airfold or not, they'd ever
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.340]   communicated with me.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.380]   They didn't tell me this is a bad company.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.380]   We don't know.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.020]   I mean, the FBI, I think, if they have the
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.460]   made a mistake, then there should be some sort of
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.740]   apology or announcement.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.980]   But we don't know.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.980]   I mean, I would not rush to blame the FBI
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.020]   as much as the server.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.580]   They shouldn't just take everything, though, because maybe
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.340]   they were told--
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.100]   Oh, it's over there.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:38.660]   It's on that.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.220]   Take that.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.300]   I mean, if they're told--
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.060]   You take three racks.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.940]   That's a lot of servers.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.540]   That is.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   And as Arment says, the FBI now presumably is in possession
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.020]   of a complete copy of the Instapaper database, including
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.340]   a full list of users in any non-deleasers bookmarks.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.180]   Passwords are hashed on Instapaper.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:58.740]   Good news.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.060]   I presume the same on Pinboard.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.700]   That's just good policy.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.980]   So those passwords would not be available to law
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   enforcement unless they really attempted a hard-board
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.060]   brute force attack on them.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.300]   And the email addresses are in the clear on Instapaper, as
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.700]   well as the contents of the bookmarks.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.740]   So there you go.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.460]   Rackspace would never have let that happen.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.020]   Right, Scobble.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.620]   Some of the best security people working at Rackspace.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.740]   Never would have let that happen.
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:35.220]   Can I ask-- I mean, if the FBI shows up at Rackspace,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.580]   what is the policy in terms of picking out which servers are
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.900]   the ones that they absolutely need?
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.140]   Do you know where exactly the meeting is?
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.460]   That's a good question.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.260]   Yeah, and Cloud is tougher because you're sharing servers
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:45.860]   with other people.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.900]   That's right.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.420]   They would have to put a very specific request for the
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.660]   kind of data that they want.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.660]   And then we would have to consider it.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.540]   We do comply with the law, so we do turn over things.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.620]   But there's a very specific procedure to do that.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.260]   And I can get more on it from the guys who deal with that
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   all the time.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.300]   We have a lot of lawyers.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.700]   Oh, Malek has the inside story on Spotify's US launch.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.540]   We're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.860]   And yes, I will talk about Google and the FTCs.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.060]   Anti-trust investigation.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.660]   Is it FTC or DOJ?
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.140]   But they're-- we'll find out for you, and I'll let you know.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.500]   Before I talk about that though, let me mention Gazelle.com.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.940]   I know a lot of you have gadgets.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.740]   Oh, it doesn't.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.700]   All of you have gadgets in the bottom of the closet, in the
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.020]   basement, all over the house that you're no longer using,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.140]   and it's just too much trouble.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.300]   And you don't want to throw them out because they're valuable.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.500]   But what are you going to do with them?
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.020]   That's why Gazelle is here.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.780]   Gazelle is fantastic.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.020]   You can get cash for your used gadgets quickly, easily.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.980]   Fair prices too.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.220]   I get a lot of tweets from people who say, hey, thank you
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.300]   for telling me about Gazelle.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.140]   This really is wonderful.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:03.100]   So let's say you've got a-- as I do, a Nokia N8 phone that
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.980]   you're just probably not going to use for a while.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.060]   There it is.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.220]   Is it functional?
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.660]   Yeah, no, I used it for one hour.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.660]   Unfortunately, we can't offer you anyway.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.100]   Wow.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.900]   Cut this part.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.940]   Oh, burn.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.980]   Burn, burn.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:26.500]   Even Nokia's N8 is worthless.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.260]   That's just-- you know what?
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:27.700]   They're smart.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.100]   They know.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:28.860]   Now, here's the beauty of this.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.860]   They're not going to get suckers.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.100]   This isn't an ATM kit.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.900]   If you do have a device that they just can't sell for
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.420]   love or money, they will recycle it.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.460]   And they do it responsibly.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.060]   They use US recyclers.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.700]   It will not end up not one bit of it in landfill.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.300]   It will not be polluting our environment.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.380]   They really do a good job with recycling.
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.580]   Let's see what else I have.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:49.980]   Let's see.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.300]   Oh, I have a Nexus-- let me see.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.700]   I have a Nexus 1 phone.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.660]   I have a lot of phones.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.420]   I think Gazelle is a absolutely necessary companion.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.140]   I have friends that have.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.540]   But if you listen to Twit as much as me and my friends do,
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.100]   and everyone just constantly know about the newest--
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.700]   what I mean, it's always the newest phone.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.140]   Oh, I said it was--
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:10.620]   No wonder.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.420]   I said the N8 was non-functioning.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.980]   That's why I clicked the wrong button.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.140]   Is it free of water damage you bet?
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.580]   All right, let's see here.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.060]   The Nexus 1-- 100 bucks.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.620]   That's great.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.100]   Boom.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.940]   So now here's what you do.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.180]   You get a box, any old box.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.700]   You throw it in the box.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.980]   They send you a mailing label.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.420]   And you can add more stuff.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.500]   But just get all your stuff gathered around the house.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.220]   And they send you a mailing label.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.580]   Yeah, I got more stuff to sell.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.940]   What else do we have lying around here?
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.060]   Tons of stuff.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.460]   Oh, yeah, the Samsung 27-inch monitor.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.700]   I don't want that anymore.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.700]   There it is.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.700]   Let's see.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.700]   [HONKING]
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.140]   All this stuff.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.780]   Oh, that's good.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.540]   Let's sell that.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.420]   Physical problems?
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.020]   Can prevent use?
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.460]   No, no noticeable flaws.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.060]   That's why it got set back.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:53.660]   Because I said it--
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.020]   You can sell that Nokia.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.100]   I bet I could get some money for that.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.460]   Oh, look at this, too, by the way.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.140]   I got to do this.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.780]   I got a bunch of old Nokia's in my closet.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.300]   Exactly.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.780]   Look at this.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.260]   This is not going to be worth much.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   There's a graph that shows you--
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.260]   yeah, if you tried to sell this in February,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.620]   we could have given you $10.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.660]   But let's see how much I get for this.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.780]   Nope, no.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.900]   Nothing for that camcorder.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.580]   9.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.860]   So, but they'll recycle it.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.380]   This is the other thing.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.700]   Can I get anything for a Zoom?
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.500]   You got a Zoom?
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.140]   Which Zoom do you have?
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.060]   Yeah, I got a Zoom.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.700]   All right, let's see.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.340]   I have a Zoom Zoom.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.980]   I've squirted to them for the two of some dollars.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.580]   Is it the original one or--
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.220]   The newest one, whatever it was.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.020]   Zoom HD?
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.700]   OK.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.300]   16 or 32 gigs.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.260]   I think it's the 16.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:32.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.020]   OK, let's see how much that's worth.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.420]   You have to pay for that, man.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.420]   You have to pay for it.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:36.940]   Yes.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.980]   For them to take it, you have to give money.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.660]   Include $10 in the box.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.300]   Do you have all the materials that came with?
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.980]   You got everything?
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.460]   Probably.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.420]   Not personalized.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.540]   You wouldn't be that crazy.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.380]   OK, let's see.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.100]   Watch this.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:49.620]   $46.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.140]   Wow.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.660]   Wow.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.260]   Look at that.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.060]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.260]   I'll take it to dinner.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.060]   I would have thought that could only be unmade
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.460]   in the fires of my Zoom.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.220]   It's funny, while you were doing that,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.060]   I was looking at the new iPod classic 6.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.180]   I got that.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.660]   You can only get $29 for that.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.700]   There you go.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.100]   There you go.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.940]   That's not good.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.300]   I mean, 20 bucks that you wouldn't add in.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.260]   So you look at the graph, though.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:11.940]   That's kind of fun.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.140]   Anyway, the whole point is here, you throw this all in the box.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.860]   One of the nice things is they're specialists then look at it
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.340]   to make sure, yes, it does work and all that.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.420]   But they will wipe all the data from it, too.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.660]   That's part of the service.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.820]   And then they send you a check.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.700]   Or you can get an Amazon gift certificate.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.620]   In fact, I think they give you a bonus.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.420]   Buy more gadgets so you can return--
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.980]   Well, that's what we do with this, isn't it?
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.220]   Buy gadgets, sell gadgets.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:34.700]   That's it.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.140]   I don't think many of you listening
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.260]   are giving up your gadget addiction.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:38.940]   No, no.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.700]   I mean, if you were, Gazelle would be a great place.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.380]   But somehow I have a feeling--
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.060]   You're giving it up.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.500]   Stop watching it right now.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.500]   Don't wait.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.940]   There's nothing for you here.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.620]   Now, after you do all of this, I want you to then enter
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.820]   the offer code TWIT.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.620]   And you will get-- what is that?
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.540]   I knew Dyson Air gadget.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.820]   Geez, that was it.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.340]   Vacuum cleaner, what is that?
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.660]   No, it's an air multiplier.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.580]   It's a fan with no blades.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.900]   Oh, I thought it was a stargate for a second.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.260]   Safe for the kids, but it looks like a fan with no--
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.420]   Oh, no, you haven't seen those?
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.820]   The Dyson-- how does it work?
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.660]   Magic.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.380]   It has a fan down in the base and it
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.420]   pushes air up through the circle and pushes it through.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.460]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.140]   It's very cool.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.220]   It's very expensive, though.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.620]   But I had to buy it because it looked like a Mac cooling fan.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.100]   And since my new iMac is so hot, I need it back behind the iMac
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.860]   and keep it cool.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.620]   They've got those Dyson hand dryers
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.500]   now in the airport where they're the blade.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.460]   You run your hands.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.140]   Oh, yeah, no, they have those at the cost.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.980]   You've got to have those in the studio, dude.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.060]   OK.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.500]   OK.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.700]   Better than the paper towel.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.260]   I wonder if Gazelle takes paper towel dispensers.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.380]   Anyway, get rid of all your junk.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.660]   Get money for it.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.940]   The average Gazelle customer, I think, it's something like--
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.460]   let me see it, says here--
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.180]   $100 or something like that.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.580]   Oh, the N8 is worth.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.740]   How much did you say?
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.900]   81 bucks?
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:01.260]   That's good.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.180]   81.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:02.700]   That's good.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.020]   I know a lot of people that watch the excellent live product
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.300]   announcement live coverage that you guys do on Tuit.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.300]   And when they go to Gazelle?
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.500]   No, just dual browser windows.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.140]   Gazelle?
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.860]   And what they're announcing on Tuit.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.140]   And what I'm selling on Gazelle.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.180]   What I'm going to be selling on Gazelle side by side.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.660]   They also, if you're a nonprofit,
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.260]   they'll set up a page for your nonprofit.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.460]   You're going to have a gadget drive instead of a cake drive,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:25.980]   that kind of thing.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.900]   I just love it.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.900]   I just think Gazelle is great.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.300]   I want you to try it.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.540]   And if you use the offer code Tuit,
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.260]   you'll get an additional 5% bonus payment at the end there
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.260]   right on top of it.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.300]   $25 million paid out to Gazelle customers.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.780]   The average Gazelle customer gets more than 100 bucks back
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.060]   for the stuff they sent in.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:47.420]   One of our chat room members paid her rent for the month
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.860]   with stuff she sold in Gazelle.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.540]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.180]   That's awesome.
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.060]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:51.740]   Don't sell it.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.580]   Gazelle.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.140]   Gazelle.com.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.420]   Although it does indicate some poor purchasing decisions
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.620]   in the past.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.140]   Just stocked up, stocked up on Elle's drive.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.220]   The rent money.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.740]   She can pay the rent.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.900]   You should vote for the rent is too damn high party.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.300]   It's a big scoop from Gigah Ome on Spotify.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.540]   We now know Spotify is coming to the US.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.820]   It says Ome Malek in just a few weeks.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.900]   Ome, did you know they signed a deal with Universal?
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.540]   Well, I think it's everything is signed to Sield and ready to go.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.180]   It's only a matter of time before they launch it.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:34.500]   I think they're going through the process of getting a lot of the music
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.500]   on their servers and stuff like that.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.300]   But here's the thing.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.700]   Here's the scoop that you had that I thought was very interesting.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.220]   Facebook.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:41.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.460]   That's going to be the big play.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:50.500]   I think, in my opinion, that changes the game for the music industry
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.100]   and competition pretty radically.
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:53:02.700]   Because the Facebook feed can be a pretty big driver of engagement
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.260]   around music.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:10.940]   And that's going to make Spotify grow really, really fast in the US.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.020]   Is this why Apple couldn't get the ping deal done with Facebook?
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.580]   I don't know about that.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:24.020]   I do know that this is definitely going to cause some kind of change
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.740]   in the music industry, definitely in the US.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:32.940]   Because I've been using Spotify for a bit.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.580]   How do you use it?
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.580]   Do you use a proxy?
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.100]   Yeah, I do use a proxy.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:42.620]   And I have to say, it just is the right way to listen to music.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   Better than Rhapsody, better than Ma.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.980]   Better than the idea.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.500]   Oh, explain why.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   Because a lot of people, I have it too.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.940]   And I've seen it go crazy in Europe.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.620]   Explain why it's so much better than all the other music
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.020]   services that are out there.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.340]   So I think it's almost like how with the iTunes, we went from buying
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.940]   random albums to buying the songs we love.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.460]   But we can't buy everything.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:12.980]   We just cannot afford to own every single track we like.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.180]   However, with Spotify, with the subscription service, what you have
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.060]   is the ability to listen to the music you like, get the playlist
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.220]   you create on any device, on any screen, in any environment,
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.860]   whether it's at home, work.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.180]   So you don't really have to reinvent your music experience
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.380]   for different devices.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:40.620]   And I think that is a huge reason why Spotify is going to become
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.500]   really popular in the US.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.380]   I mean, look at us.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.380]   When we are a society where we have two or three different
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:52.060]   screens already, we have a laptop, we have an iPhone/enroid
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:58.220]   device, we have a TV, we have your digital music player,
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.660]   like Sonos.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.180]   So you have a whole bunch of devices where you need the
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.420]   content to be delivered to.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.500]   And I think Spotify has taken the right approach.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.020]   I think Netflix is one of the main reasons
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:16.380]   Netflix is popular is because you can watch it on any screen,
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.500]   anytime, and you don't have to worry about, oh, is this the
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.500]   same playlist?
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.580]   No, it's not, you know, or not.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.100]   So I think it's that experience is what travels with you,
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.900]   not the physical music, right?
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.660]   What's different about it than Rhapsody or Pandora?
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.220]   A lot of people are still arguing with you in the chat room.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.340]   It seems very similar.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.500]   No, I think there isn't.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.700]   But just look at the user experience is definitely
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:46.140]   better than Rhapsody and Pandora is slightly different.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.660]   Pandora, I'll grant you Pandora.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.220]   Pandora is not the same song over and over.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.380]   You don't get to pick the music, they pick the music.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.900]   I like Mogg, I use Mogg because I could do Pandora-style
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.220]   stations with it.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.020]   I could take my playlist with me, it plays on all my devices,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.700]   plays on my Sonos radio.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:05.340]   Brian Rushwood is frantically texting me that Mogg does all
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:10.700]   that and can go to a million songs, 320 kilobits streaming
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.260]   audio, so it's good quality.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.700]   I will also say this, you better be careful talking
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.780]   about how you use a proxy for Spotify.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.300]   My friend who I went to college with, Steve Kovac,
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.460]   who writes for Silicon Alley Insider,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.500]   wrote a post about how people were using proxies to use Spotify.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.900]   And the Spotify CEO did not take too kindly to that.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.780]   Said that in retaliation for telling people how to steal from us,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.180]   he published my friend, Steve's address to New York City
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.980]   and told people to go rob him.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:38.540]   What?
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.900]   Seriously.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.980]   I think he pulled down the blog post, but it was up there.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.300]   You can find it in Google.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.340]   Incredible cash, yeah.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.380]   Malphasants.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.580]   I can't believe that.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.020]   Spotify-- go ahead.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.300]   By the way, have you heard the same thing I heard
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.140]   from an investor or a partner of Spotify
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.900]   that they're really getting greedy?
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.460]   Why?
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.380]   I have not heard anything of that sort.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.500]   And I think the idea of what is greedy
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.780]   is kind of debatable, right?
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.340]   Like, I don't know.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.900]   It may be what's greedy to you, may not be greedy to them, right?
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:16.300]   And what's greedy to them, may not be greedy to other people.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.820]   So I think we have to be very relative about that.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:24.180]   That said, there is one reason I do feel that Spotify will have
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.820]   an advantage over a mug and rhapsody,
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.540]   is the brand recognition and the close relationship
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.620]   with Facebook.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.900]   I think that is what is going to--
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.060]   That's going to be great.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.300]   Well, Facebook will put it--
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.340]   We'll put it through the roof, if that's true.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.300]   That's huge.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.700]   Well, the question I have for you, home,
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.660]   is that the biggest thing is--
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.260]   you brought up Netflix, which to me,
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:50.020]   all of my online subscription payment, your relative worth,
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.100]   to me, is judged off the $8 digital-only Netflix streaming--
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.500]   That's kind of the gold standard.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.740]   To me, it's like I judge it above and beyond that.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.700]   And right now, for it to get what I would use Spotify
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.180]   the most for is on my phone, like I use Pandora.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.540]   And that's $10 a month.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.060]   You're asking me to pay $2 more.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.500]   By the way, what if I told you that Facebook CEO--
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.380]   I mean, Netflix's CAO, Ray Hastings,
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.260]   just joined the Facebook board of directors.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.180]   That's very, very, very interesting.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.420]   Don't you think that's interesting?
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.060]   I mean, if you look at two companies that
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.540]   have a great interest--
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:25.140]   Netflix has always tried to understand more of what
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.580]   do you want to watch next, so you can keep using their service.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.020]   And Facebook is really good at understanding
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.740]   who your friends are and what you want to see
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.580]   to keep you involved in Facebook.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.660]   It feels to me as if Facebook just
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.580]   wants to keep everybody in Facebook.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.740]   They don't want you to leave the Facebook page.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.540]   They want you to have Spotify for your music.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.420]   I'm sure they'll put Netflix in there.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.340]   They've already started streaming some movies.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.900]   So you don't ever have to leave Facebook.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.580]   Is that the strategy, Omala?
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.540]   Is that where they're going?
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.260]   You know, I think there is--
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.380]   let's not get too carried away on that.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.340]   I think what--
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.740]   No, they want to be your web.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.780]   They want your homepage.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.220]   They don't want you ever to leave.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:00.940]   And you know what?
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.660]   It's working.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.500]   Maybe, maybe it's not.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.380]   You know, what is Netflix trying to do?
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.660]   Netflix wants social data.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.620]   That's what it wants.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.300]   It wants recommendations from your friends,
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.460]   what movies to watch, what shows to watch.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:19.540]   Look, whether it's music or movies,
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.220]   those are two inherently social activities.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:26.620]   We talk about music with all our friends, family, we share.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:31.660]   Remember, back in the day when you and I had Black hair,
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.580]   we would make mixtapes.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.500]   Now we just make playlists.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:36.860]   Really?
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.940]   You made mixtapes, huh?
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:38.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.180]   Like everybody made mixtapes.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.260]   That's how you hit on a check.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.300]   Yeah, no, pick them up with the mixtape.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:43.780]   Yeah, pick them up.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.180]   And by the way, do you listen to the Kia track?
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:46.860]   It's pretty sweet, right?
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:47.780]   It's pretty sweet.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.580]   Yeah, if it worked, it was great.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:50.060]   If it was done.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.020]   I made a tape for you.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.420]   I hope you don't mind.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.820]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.500]   I was thinking of you.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.380]   Oh, you were crazy about turntable.fm,
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.980]   as everybody else is in the game.
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.940]   I am. I've been five days without sleeping.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.020]   Oh, come on, really?
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.460]   But I had lunch with Ashton Kutcher the other day,
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.580]   and he was listening to it.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.500]   And he's going, this is the coolest thing I've ever had.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.940]   I mean, that thing can just create such opportunities.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.620]   This is better.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.580]   This is Pandora only better.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.140]   It's a human-driven Pandora, right?
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.100]   Yeah, I don't know if I would even put it in that thing.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.980]   I don't know one needs to fail so the other can succeed.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.300]   I think this is--
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.100]   Exactly.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.460]   This is a great--
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.620]   I mean, I know for us.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.620]   I mean, the fans of "MZW."
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.140]   Whoa.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.060]   Yeah, what party you now?
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:33.980]   I can't turn it off.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.700]   You know, fans of "MZW," chat realm,
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.860]   they've been on this since at first time.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.260]   So just for people who haven't tried it,
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.180]   turntable.fm, if any of your Facebook friends
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.660]   are using it, you can use it.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.700]   That's how they're doing it.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.740]   It's a performance space.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.180]   You've got five DJs.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.540]   And then you could vote on the song.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.860]   The song is lame or awesome.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.380]   And if you get to be one of the DJs,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.500]   you get to check to choose music.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.220]   You can add songs from your own library
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.340]   or find songs on their library.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.540]   So it is kind of like you're listening to somebody's radio
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:08.740]   stage.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.060]   True.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   But they are--
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:10.700]   Well, I mean--
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.780]   The problem is it all turns into a dubstep.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.540]   Yes, of course.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.460]   As all does.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.140]   As it should.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.940]   Really, that is the evolution of the internet.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.540]   Oh, no.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.700]   We go--
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.700]   We all eventually evolve into dubstep.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.820]   And, oh, you wrote about this, right?
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.300]   That right now they're having a big problem overseas
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.660]   in terms of their licensing thing,
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.300]   which always seems to be the story of any kind of online music
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.460]   streaming service, be it Pandora, Spotify, or otherwise,
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.940]   that you have to, at some point, deal
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.060]   with these licensing issues.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.300]   Oh, did you lose interest?
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.700]   Or are you still staying up nights playing?
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.540]   No, I'm not playing.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.220]   And didn't stay up last night.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.860]   I had to get some sleep.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.860]   But I think that people do lose interest in this after a while.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.500]   That's what Sarah might have still been.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.620]   I don't know.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:58.220]   I kind of feel that what's your engagement level?
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.820]   I think a lot of us, for me, first four or five days,
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.100]   it was extreme amount of attention to this service.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.940]   And then I found the amount of balance, which I needed,
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.380]   like how much time I want to spend on it.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.820]   And how much time I--
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.940]   For me, this is just discovery of music.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.580]   It's so much better than trying to figure out
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:22.600]   what to listen to next or put my Spotify collection
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.300]   on randomized.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.920]   So this is a lot of interesting people sharing interesting
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.980]   tunes.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.700]   I like that.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.540]   I like it.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.340]   I'm a little bummed out about this whole access
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:40.700]   to be overseas people being denied to access to turntable.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.140]   Because I was listening to music recommended by folks
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:50.260]   from Brazil, from other parts of Latin America, parts of Middle
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:50.840]   East.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.080]   I never heard these songs.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.600]   And I like listening to global electronic music.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.520]   And it was great to kind of discover those tunes.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.240]   And so there you go.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.080]   I mean, I think this is the way music industry has
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.760]   to think of this as a discovery mechanism,
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.480]   not as a way to destroy.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.400]   It's not a service which is destroying value.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.240]   It's actually creating more value.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.000]   Because I've found so many songs, which I ended up
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.740]   buying on iTunes mostly because they were available.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.600]   And they sounded great.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.040]   But some of them aren't on Spotify.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.020]   Some of them are not.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.360]   And so I'm actually spending money on more music.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.840]   It just is listening to music on radio.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.960]   And I think I hope these guys figure it out.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.160]   The turntable goes global.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.560]   Because the beauty of turntable is that it can actually
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.640]   make global music listening experience very
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.720]   local and very personal.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.760]   I think they also need a mobile.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.360]   Well, that can come too.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.080]   But for now, I think if we are happy with just this one,
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.520]   the listening aspect of it.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.040]   But I just am a little bummed out
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.160]   about the whole international shutdown.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.440]   I have to say, though, I mean, that's obviously an issue
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.800]   that the music labels have different--
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.600]   don't cross borders and all that stuff.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.800]   And that's why Spotify wasn't available in the US.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.640]   They had to renegotiate their deals and vice versa.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.360]   But I do think that for people who, for a long time,
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.680]   were looking at the music industry
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.400]   and saying these guys don't get it.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.320]   They don't understand the internet.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.680]   They don't understand what's going on.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.080]   They're prosecuting people instead
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.880]   of trying to find a new business model.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.280]   This is the new music industry.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.200]   And it seems like they kind of do get it.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.440]   And they kind of have found a new business model.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.640]   And it actually gives me some real hope for the future of music.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.120]   Isn't this great for artists?
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.560]   At least.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   And there is-- if you really look at the hard numbers
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.400]   of how much artists get paid for streaming services--
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.880]   Well, Spotify, they make very little money from, right?
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.160]   I mean, Pandora, they make very little money.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.080]   I'm sure turntable isn't much, much better,
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.440]   just because that's the operation that they're running.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.160]   It's a smaller economy.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.440]   And the labels, on some level, have
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.120]   to look out for those kind of rights.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.080]   I would say, though, that I would
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.000]   be way more excited to see Facebook integrate with turntable
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.800]   than I will be Facebook integrating with Spotify.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.000]   Because I think that those natural friend groupings
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.560]   that I have on Facebook, I would love to match up
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.120]   with some of my friends there and easily integrate that
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.480]   into that experience than necessarily just get
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.280]   another music streaming service that I could get elsewhere.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.760]   Do you agree, Robert and Home, that this is kind of the new music
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.720]   industry and that they're starting to get it?
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.240]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.760]   I wrote about this yesterday.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.000]   There is an artist in San Francisco called Olga Nunez.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.240]   And she played a set on turntable.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.280]   And then she shot up to number two on Bandcamp.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.200]   Wow.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.440]   Right, like right there.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:57.000]   Because I think there is nothing more engaging than an artist
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.520]   showcasing their own music and the music they like.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.080]   I think that's what--
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.080]   Oh.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.600]   There is nothing--
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.760]   You know, there was a series of albums which
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   came out in the late '90s, early 2000s, which basically had
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.440]   people like massive attack and REM playing some of their
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.760]   favorite, almost like creating a mixed tape.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.360]   And I always bought those mostly because I was surprised by
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.640]   the music they listened to.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:30.040]   And I think that made me relate to them a lot more than
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.880]   just their cookie cutter albums.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.840]   And I think that is what music is all about.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.080]   I think the SoundCloud is another service which is out there.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.160]   And the music industry is changing.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.720]   And I think the idea of what was the old rules have to
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.960]   change, otherwise--
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.000]   Absolutely.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.200]   I mean, the artists have to take more control.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.520]   I mean, they have to--
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.880]   makes life a lot tougher for them.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.200]   But it also is their battle to lose.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.800]   Also, my producer, his son, is in a new rock and roll band.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.360]   We went to Concord to listen to him.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.800]   And there was two bands, and there was 15 people in the
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.600]   audience.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.160]   So there's a lot of starving musicians who are just doing
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.840]   it for fun right now.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.560]   And if you can use these tools to get noticed and get 200
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.640]   people or 500 people to listen to, now you're starting to
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.800]   build a business out of it that's better than just playing
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.840]   a bar.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.920]   A lot of art--
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.040]   I think this is interesting.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.320]   I didn't even think about this, but are a lot of artists
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.160]   doing their own turntable.fm rooms and performing their
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.280]   music in--
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.120]   Well, I haven't seen very many exercises.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.560]   That's brilliant.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.520]   I think if somebody like Kanye came out--
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.360]   Oh, I just--
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:43.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.880]   --and then we just go blow up completely.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.920]   This will be huge.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.640]   And I think that's what we need is somebody of that
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.800]   stature to show up and just start pushing it.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.840]   Well, yeah, the bigger this get, the more you're going to
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.400]   attract attention like that.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.160]   And the more you're going to get the celebrity--
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.320]   But it is in the Kanye's of the world who really need turntable.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.040]   He doesn't need it to sell music.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.720]   But people like Olga, this is a real opportunity for her to
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.000]   find an audience and to play your music and to get people
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.840]   excited about it and buy it.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.480]   That's great.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.720]   And there are probably a lot of mid-tier artists.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.040]   Well, and also me, Kanye runs an imprint, I believe, I
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.680]   forget, on which major label, but it's like good music or
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.200]   whatever.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.320]   He's got younger artists.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.280]   He's got new artists that he's trying to break on that
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:25.640]   label.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.000]   If he goes onto a turntable FM room, starts playing some
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.880]   of his hits, it's gold digger.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.480]   And some of the hits there.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.840]   And then plays another one.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.480]   That's the cool thing about turntables, that you're a
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.680]   song you like and then a new song that you hadn't heard
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.320]   before that's similar to this.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.480]   But it's curated by people who have similar music days and
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.560]   not an algorithm like what Pandora is.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.520]   I'm a huge, huge, huge fan of it.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.160]   Very intriguing.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.480]   I'll tell you, in the music industry, at least the floor
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.400]   has not completely fallen out like it is in the publishing
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.880]   industry, where you have these e-books coming out at a
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.720]   dollar to $3, where there's no way that they can compete on
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.720]   that.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.720]   In their business model, it is completely--
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.240]   they can't go that low.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.600]   I think it's very similar.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.720]   And somebody just said, if you--
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.240]   they just don't CNBC had somebody from the RIAA on and no,
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.000]   the music industry still does not get it.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.840]   And I think that there's pockets of people in the music
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   industry who get it.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.480]   And then there's a lot of people who don't get it.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.200]   But I think this is the opportunity for the music
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.040]   industry to find new business models and to survive.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.840]   Is Best Buy a big player in all of this?
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.160]   They're going to do a cloud service.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.640]   I'm sure it's going to be as good as their buyback service.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.080]   It reminds me when Walmart was doing something similar.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:47.800]   They would call it--
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.960]   They should have named their cloud, hey, guys, us too, right?
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.000]   Yeah, we're in there.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.880]   Yeah, we got a cloud.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.920]   We got a cloud.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.560]   Yeah, I talked to Best Buy CTO at the Google I/O conference.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.240]   And he said, hey, look, we have three I/Os of stuff,
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.160]   all the CDs and things--
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.320]   They still sell CDs.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.560]   --that are going away.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.840]   So they're trying to find a new way
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.400]   to integrate that into their customers.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.160]   It's a tough thing for them to do.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.920]   I'll tell you, I would not want to be a brick and mortar
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.160]   store selling anything that you could buy online at this point.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.520]   I would disagree with you on that.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.160]   I think they have to think differently about their business.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.840]   And just because that's the problem with the music industry,
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.520]   that's the problem with the book industry,
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.400]   that's the problem with the physical stores,
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.720]   they don't understand that digital is
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.960]   part of their existence.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.520]   Digital is a way-- it's a channel.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.400]   It is a way to get more engagement with their products.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.200]   Look at-- it's physical store.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.360]   Apple is a physical store for God's sake.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.640]   You just go there.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.720]   There's so many people.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.600]   What are they doing?
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.080]   They're engaging with the products.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.120]   They're not just in the business of selling CDs.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.520]   They're in the business of engaging with their audience,
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.000]   getting them to appreciate the product, and then buying it.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.520]   And I think that's all the successful retailers
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.960]   have done that in the past.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.480]   Can I say the best buy, do it?
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.160]   And I could see an independent music store,
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.520]   an Amoeba music can survive.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.400]   I think a great independent bookstore,
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.880]   like Appowel's books, can survive
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.960]   because they provide service, they provide a locale
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.560]   where people gather.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.800]   But who's going to go to a best buy
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.080]   to find out what great music is available?
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.800]   Well, I mean, I think for the cloud thing,
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.040]   I totally agree with Om that they have to innovate.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.080]   And they can't just think within how do we
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.280]   survive as a brick and mortar inside the store.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.360]   I mean, to me, I don't know what the solution for Best Buy
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:48.860]   is.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.160]   I don't think that their solution is chasing taillights
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.960]   and saying, Amazon's got a cloud, Google's got a cloud,
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.280]   Apple's got a cloud, we got a cloud.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.240]   We're the best buy cloud.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:56.440]   Come here.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:56.960]   Well, you know what?
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.760]   You don't want to be.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.360]   It's the story that people go to to look at the thing
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.720]   and then go home and buy on Amazon.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.760]   Well, I mean, that's who Best Buy is.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   That is a general problem.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.840]   And I think Andrew and your manager
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.440]   has texted me that the only cloud they're going to
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.640]   is the one that Circuit City ended up on.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.040]   But you have hope for them, Om.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.400]   I'm glad to see that.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   So I actually wanted to just complete the circle.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.200]   I wrote a post about seven, eight months ago
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.400]   called There Is No New Media.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.360]   It's all new consumption.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.720]   And I hope, I think the point I was trying to make in that
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.280]   is that we have to stop thinking in terms of isolated
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.000]   products and isolated devices and isolated sales channels.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.120]   And we have to think in terms of a bigger ecosystem
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.480]   and build a business based on that.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.880]   I think somebody like Amazon, in my opinion,
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.920]   should start a physical store, which showcases their digital
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.640]   goods and creates an experience around that.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.560]   And I think that is where we will end up.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.480]   Interesting.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.720]   This is very painful.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.400]   Do you think that's going to happen after they
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.800]   kill the tax benefits of getting stuff out of state?
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.600]   Yeah, they can't open stores until then, because they'll
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.200]   just--
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.000]   You'll have to pay sales tax, all of a sudden.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.560]   I don't know when that will happen,
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.920]   but they will eventually have to move to that place.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.960]   Just because--
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.800]   I would have mocked you, Om, when they said that.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.360]   But then look at the example of Apple,
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.440]   and its retail stores.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.360]   Apple's been success.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.640]   Huge and very, very smart.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.400]   And the other thing that Apple has is they have a very,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.520]   very small product line.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.200]   They know exactly what they're selling,
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.640]   and they know exactly how to sell it.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.280]   I guess you couldn't put everything in Amazon.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   No.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.960]   No, you could not.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.200]   I mean, there is a place where you can showcase what Amazon
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:42.920]   does well.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.120]   I don't know if that's Amazon store.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.760]   Amazon could buy Costco or Walmart.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.200]   That is the idea.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.280]   I need to.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.640]   Again, you're thinking about Amazon Store
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.880]   as an experience of buying physical products.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.960]   What is it that Amazon can do?
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.200]   It can provide an Amazon space where people
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.400]   can engage with Amazon services, whether it's
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.320]   tablet, Skindles, whatever.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.160]   It can provide a place where its authors can go and give talks
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.680]   and read from the book.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.720]   I mean, look, those things are very important
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.640]   for publicizing a book.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.880]   And for getting a book in the hands of people
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.000]   is the book tours, or having an unplugged performance
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.960]   of an artist in an Amazon space who's
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.720]   trying to sell digital music on Amazon.com.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.040]   Amazon will have to do it as it will become more and more
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.000]   important in our life.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.160]   As a company, it needs to have that local presence.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.880]   And also, remember, we are living in a world
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.560]   where we have an iPhone or a smartphone in our pocket
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.800]   all the time.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.960]   So for the retailers itself, it's a very competitive market.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.200]   There are apps which can basically let you check the price
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.480]   and order it online while you're looking at it in a store.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.040]   So the stores have to think in terms of what
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.520]   is the plus experience they can offer so that people come
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.560]   to the store and buy their things.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.320]   And same is with Amazon, too.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.760]   They need for people to keep buying from them,
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.600]   but they need to create a whole experience around it.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.400]   I think I'm clearly maybe a few years too early
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.600]   on this whole idea.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.280]   But if you--
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.040]   I think your few centuries do late.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.040]   OK.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.800]   Well, I don't understand from what you've said what Amazon--
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.720]   I see no compelling reason to do this.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.040]   And what they can't do for--
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.880]   and I think putting out authors and everything
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.280]   and introducing them so you can buy stuff on your phone
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   is an interesting idea.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.320]   I just don't know why you need to have a physical space
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.600]   and you can't partner with other places--
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.320]   I think about how you have to pay rent every month.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.720]   How do I buy something?
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.280]   I don't buy it because I went to a physical space
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.720]   and I participated somehow in the experience of it.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.600]   I ask friends, you do?
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.320]   Well, absolutely.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.240]   I bought Apple Gear online from Apple and from the store.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.720]   And I buy it because I know I can keep the store
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.840]   if I have to have it.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.880]   Right now.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.800]   Absolutely.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.320]   But maybe because I hate people.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:16.720]   But I--
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.680]   You know, I have a 24-inch Apple monitor
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.160]   that is going back to them.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.640]   And I can take it--
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.200]   it has a flickering problem with this new iMac.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.480]   And I can take it into the store and show it to them.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:29.840]   That's--
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.600]   So instead of trying to convince somebody over the phone--
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.120]   So what you've just described is a tech support depot.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.880]   And that's a big deal about Apple.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.080]   I mean, look at how hard it is to get a spot at the genius
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.600]   bar lately, you know?
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.240]   Yeah, no, Apple stores are jammed.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.880]   Apple stores obviously work.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.080]   And they make their own product.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.440]   You know, they make their own product.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.680]   They have a constrained product line.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.560]   They can have every single item in their product line
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560]   in the store.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.080]   And it looks--
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.800]   I don't know all my-- I mean, look, I love independent bookstores.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.920]   I love going to author readings and author signings.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.280]   I love that idea.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.880]   But I see them dying right and left.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.000]   And that is exactly the reason.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   I mean, if Amazon-- the bookstores die,
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.240]   and we become a culture where only the top 50 books are
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.400]   the ones we hear about in the media
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.640]   and they are the ones which are getting sold,
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.000]   then we have a problem where a lot of the newer authors
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.400]   don't get discovered.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   But I'm trying to say is that, you know,
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.760]   let's stop thinking about retail as like a physical space
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.680]   where you go and buy physical goods.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.120]   You will still do what you do on Amazon online.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.560]   But what if they do need to have a place where their business
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.800]   is still books and music and--
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.640]   No, that's called Starbucks.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.000]   Well, so you know, Starbucks or Amazon's own store,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   it's not such a radical idea.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   I think you do a deal with Starbucks.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.600]   Well, you've got to think of it as a head of his time.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.640]   I think when the sales tax advantage that mail order retailers
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.160]   have over brick and mortar retailers,
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.000]   when that goes away, Amazon's going
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.680]   to feel very much more likely to do this kind of concept
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.800]   where they want to have high touch with their customers.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.400]   I think you look at what Barnes and Noble is doing right now,
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.120]   is that they're creating more and more experience
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.560]   around their store.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.080]   They're shutting down the ones which are not working.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.080]   But they're creating this more of an experience
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.400]   and less of like, you know, stocking books there.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.280]   And I think that's exactly what I'm trying to tell you guys.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.960]   That's where Amazon will end up.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.600]   Or if not, Amazon, somebody else will end up trying to do that.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.000]   Because that is important for the whole ecosystem of books
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.440]   and, you know, music and, you know, those kind of things.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.840]   Starbucks, maybe, but Starbucks doesn't cut it.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.000]   Like, look at, they're just, they just want to cram
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.360]   as many people to sell coffee.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.880]   And this is a slightly different way of thinking about it.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   Right?
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.840]   But I see shopping malls full of stores
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.440]   that you can get stuff online for cheaper.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.840]   People still go into stores.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.920]   They still love shopping.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.240]   I personally don't love it all that much.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.040]   But, you know, talk to my wife.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.360]   You have to shop for clothes.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.200]   No, you have to shop for clothes in person.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.560]   Oh, that's lots of stuff.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.600]   Clothes.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.480]   You know, you don't have to shop for clothes in person.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.720]   You can buy all that stuff online, too.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.640]   Well, I mean, it's a longer process.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.480]   Chicks like to try stuff on.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.320]   Oh, check it out.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.840]   I was behind two chicks at Ritz today.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.520]   They were talking about buying shoes online.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.120]   They said they saved 20% by buying them online
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.000]   and they can get a better deal
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.160]   and they have better service online.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.360]   You know, it's, I don't know.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.680]   You know, I see, I see malls full of stores for a reason.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.200]   And I see Amazon, it's somewhere that is going to wake up.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.800]   Where is Rackspace?
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.600]   Where is Rackspace headquarters?
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.720]   San Antonio, Texas.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.960]   In what?
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.360]   In a huge shopping mall.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.840]   That died.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840]   That died.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.720]   It is now in a perfect metaphor hosting Rackspace.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.280]   Yes, internet commerce.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   You know, I really, I don't know how the R idea of a,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.560]   you know, a retail experience changes
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.120]   when we can do everything on our phone.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.680]   I think that there's always going to be a room
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.880]   for a physical presence.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.120]   But it sounds like you guys are describing a social space,
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:22.960]   not a store.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.080]   I don't know how a store is our social space.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.800]   That is exactly what I've been trying to tell you guys.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.480]   It's exactly the same thing.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.640]   It's not the physical sale of the goods,
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.360]   but the concept of books, you know, like the things
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.520]   which go along with the books,
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.040]   which need to happen in a physical space,
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.800]   think, you know, social space for,
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.000]   for talking about music or, you know, you know,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.360]   unplug performances from small independent artists.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   Those kind of things is what a retail experience needs to have.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.680]   And also let's not forget guys like Amazon
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.360]   are also making more and more, you know, devices now.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360]   They're going to make tablets and they're going to make
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.760]   kindles and who knows what next, right?
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.600]   It's not, you know, that inconceivable for them
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.160]   to actually start making more devices as endpoints
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.520]   for delivery of their digital content.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.640]   So they need to create a bigger experience
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.360]   around that as well.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.240]   Yeah, you know, it is, that's what I'm saying is
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.440]   don't think of it as the bookstore as you know it right now
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.360]   or a retail outlet as you know it now,
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.560]   but think how would you reimagine it for the next 50 years?
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:37.440]   Not for what it was for last 150 years,
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.160]   but what it will be, you know, I think the idea is
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.360]   we always get caught up in how the past
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.840]   is going to define the future.
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.240]   That's never the case.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.680]   So if you were to do a new kind of a social space
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.760]   around the idea of books and other kinds of content,
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   how would you do it?
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.160]   And I think the company which is very well positioned
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.600]   to do that is Amazon, not Starbox because that's not--
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.760]   Well, think of IKEA.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.840]   I mean, go through IKEA, it's like a maze.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.360]   And I, you know, I love looking there.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.480]   I would never buy that kind of stuff online
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.040]   'cause I couldn't see it.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.320]   It's also expensive to ship.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.360]   I mean, there are some things that will stay in brick and mortar.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.200]   I don't know.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.040]   I think you guys, it's like--
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.880]   I don't know.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.040]   I'm in next to the town commons.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.440]   And we'll be walking to work.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.640]   And it just doesn't, it sounds like a nostalgia
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.920]   for a pastoral past that I don't think is,
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.760]   I think it's gone.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.600]   I think people are going to stay in their houses.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.400]   They're not going to come out anymore.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.680]   They're going to buy everything.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.640]   It's going to be brought to them by a uniformed employee
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.480]   of the federal government.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.320]   Sure.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320]   We're all going to be like Howard Hughes.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.160]   We're going to be--
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.000]   Line up the bottles.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.600]   Exactly.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.720]   I think that that, while I agree with you,
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.000]   when we would be good for us to expose new artists
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.200]   and get to know each other and all that stuff,
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.560]   that's not where we're headed.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.160]   Another thing to think of is the Apple Store
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.000]   versus a prospective Amazon store.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.960]   Even if you're buying stuff online
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.800]   and you have a limited amount of employees there
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.760]   that you're paying out, is the Amazon price for--
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.000]   sorry, the average price for an Apple product is in the hundreds.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.280]   They make a lot of money on Amazon.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.440]   The average price for an Amazon purchase is in the 10.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.720]   All I have to say is Facebook.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.440]   Low 10s.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.120]   Facebook.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:12.680]   Facebook.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.240]   750 million users, according to TechCrunch.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.600]   Facebook's not confirming, but that sounds about right.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.440]   750 million users.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.240]   That's our new social experience.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.840]   And it's one sitting behind a screen
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.840]   in the comfort of your own cave.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.480]   Sure.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.880]   That's what people want.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.360]   Oh, I wish you were right.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:29.920]   But I think we're--
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:29.920]   Trouble.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920]   Terrible.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.240]   Time will tell.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.760]   I think we are being dismissive of the physical space too soon.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.680]   I think the human nature requires it.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.160]   I mean, just look at the number of people
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.200]   who live in urban environment.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.640]   And you do need to go out in Tromingo and mix
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.600]   with the other people.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.680]   I mean, you mean--
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680]   Look, you mean yourself, Rio.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.800]   Why are you building this really cool studio for us
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.360]   all to travel and hang out with you?
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.640]   It's cooler to hang out face to face.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.560]   Well, a handful of people, but most people
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.160]   experience it over the internet.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:10.760]   You know--
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.000]   I don't know if it's worth the rent.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.160]   I mean, I agree with all of the--
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.200]   I agree with everything that you're saying, home.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.480]   I just don't know if when it comes down--
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.640]   I've got a brick yet for--
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.880]   I think you should-- you should--
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.600]   You should fix that.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.160]   You should be buying--
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.600]   I'm looking at $600 and something dollars, right?
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.360]   For the big one.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:27.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.440]   Well, if you want the logo--
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.360]   I want the logo, baby.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.280]   You could have a building 43 logo on a brick.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.560]   We would love that, actually, if you did that.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.200]   How much does that?
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.840]   Well, go to bricks.twit.tv.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.640]   I think it's all there.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   It tells you everything.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.400]   That's 600 and so--
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.360]   I have to apologize for our international viewers
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.560]   that we don't have a better way to buy internationally.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.280]   You have to call that 800 number.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:47.880]   It is toll free.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.400]   You can call it via Skype, so it won't cost you anything to call.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.200]   I admit, I know.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.480]   See, this is interesting.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.080]   This is an example of what I was talking about.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.600]   You can order internationally.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.280]   You merely call that number.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.200]   And yet, I get constant emails from our international audience
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.520]   saying, can I just order online?
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.120]   I don't want to talk to a human.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.120]   I wish to autoflums in on that.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.520]   So yeah, 8 by 8 brick with a custom logo, 640 bucks.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.960]   But you're worth it.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.760]   Do we know where this brick's going to be?
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.120]   Are you going to put me in the bathroom?
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:18.920]   Are you going to put me out front?
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.680]   You could be anywhere you want.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.280]   I'll put you where you want to be.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.200]   This is what the Twit logo looks like on a brick.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.440]   They do a really nice job.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:25.920]   They laser cut this--
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.040]   They're fantastic, yeah.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.520]   Yeah, they laser cut this into the brick.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.920]   We will have a limited number of these.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.960]   I think there's only 200 total of these.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.600]   So don't wait too long, Robert.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.760]   How many you got left?
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.280]   I don't know.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.320]   But I think there's--
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:38.840]   Dude.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.360]   I think there's 198 left.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.320]   OK.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.200]   No, I don't know.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.000]   But these don't sell real fast, as you might imagine.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:46.800]   Come on, man.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   You got a lot of fans.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.680]   Most people-- oh, we do.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.080]   And you know what?
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.120]   We've sold 1,000 bricks.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.520]   But most of them are the $128 bricks.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.200]   And you will love seeing this wall, Robert.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.880]   When people come to the studio, there's memorials to parents.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.600]   Somebody wrote a push here to open wall.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.080]   I mean, there's just some great stuff.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.680]   I'm with stupid and an arrow pointed to the brick to his left.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.360]   That's awesome.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.040]   There's some great stuff.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.520]   So it'll be fun to browse our brick garden.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.760]   And to answer your question, Robert, it's in the entryway.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.520]   It's right there when you first come in.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.360]   I know.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.480]   John Zilina, Jammerby, who's--
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.560]   He's got the diamond club bricks.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.520]   He's got the diamond.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.560]   He came and wants me to--
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.120]   wants my brick to be behind the toilet paper holder.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.160]   I can put it there if you wish.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.120]   Actually, you know, we were going to--
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.320]   and we haven't gotten around to it.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.120]   We might still do this cell naming rights for my studio,
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.160]   for the bathroom.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.800]   Oh, like a stadium?
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.720]   So the Twit Brickhouse Brad there brought to you by--
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.040]   Justin Robert Young.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:42.800]   So that'll--
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.640]   That'll-- that'll-- that'll--
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.400]   watch for that later in an eBay auction near you.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.560]   This is the bricks are for sale now.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.240]   And the last--
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.080]   I'm going dibs on the plunger, by the way.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.840]   Don't wait too long, because we've got to--
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.920]   before we open the studio, we've got to install these bricks.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.320]   So it's-- it's literally a matter of weeks
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.120]   before we cut off sales bricks.twit.tv.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.680]   And it's not a nonprofit.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.520]   There is no tax deduction.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.840]   It is merely a way of getting you a chance
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.560]   to own a little piece of the Twit Brickhouse
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.920]   and to support Twit.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.200]   We actually-- the money that we're raising with this
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.040]   is much needed.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.800]   We're putting it into cameras and the lighting
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.360]   into a lot of things that we really need to buy in the studio.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.080]   So thank everybody who's--
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.600]   Better head sets.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.480]   Say again?
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.800]   Better head sets.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.000]   Better head sets.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.440]   Yes.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.800]   Would you like a better headset home?
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.600]   Are you on now on?
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.120]   The one sponsor, Ohm's headset.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.680]   We bought Ohm his headset.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   We could have sponsored--
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.120]   We could have sponsored headsets.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.520]   Ohm's sounding pretty good on that headset.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.480]   Yeah, it's a lot better.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.120]   A lot better, I have to say.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.880]   It's very uncomfortable, that's all.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.160]   You know what?
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.000]   Come up to Petaluma.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.400]   We'll get some nice--
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.080]   you can't drink one.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.000]   I'll get some nice iced tea for you.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360]   I can have a glass of red once in a while.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.760]   It's good for your heart, Ohm.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.120]   Yeah, once in a while, it's fine.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.520]   I have some nice Scotch I'll bring up for you.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.600]   You can drink Scotch?
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.200]   Yeah, I can see you drink.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200]   Why weren't you in the studio this week?
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.760]   Yeah, I know we have some good Scotch over here.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.520]   Did you want some Scotch?
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:05.800]   I don't know.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.080]   I would bring some for you.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080]   That's probably a bad idea.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.000]   Well, thank you.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.840]   We would love it if you'd come up.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.800]   And I think you're right.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.000]   Absolutely right, Robert.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.680]   One of the reasons we are building such a nice place
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.480]   is because we want a sense of space.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.320]   We want a place that people want to come up and visit.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.400]   And that's absolutely the truth.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.360]   It's going to be the tourist attraction in Petaluma.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.200]   Well, you know, you can see it from the street.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.200]   The windows are the studios right on the street.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.080]   We have these big port holes you can look through.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:32.600]   They look amazing.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.200]   They're pretty cool.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.120]   They're so cool.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.200]   I drove by it the other day.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.080]   Yeah, come over.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:36.560]   It's pretty good.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.080]   Come over.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.320]   Well, I'll give you a tour the next time you're in town.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.800]   I'm going to be there when you launch.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.000]   I'll be at the launch party.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.280]   It's just a few weeks off.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.080]   We're very excited about it.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.760]   You're going to close down that whole block, man.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.880]   You know, we actually inquired.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.080]   We went to the police department and they said,
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:49.760]   it's too big a street.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.800]   We can't close it down.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.680]   So we'll just fill it with people and then cars
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.320]   can try to get to it.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.200]   Deal with it, pigs.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.480]   Deal with it, pigs.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.240]   We're calling you out.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.760]   The Petaluma pigs.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.320]   That'll help.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.600]   Yeah, there'll be no problem getting that parade permit.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]   No.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.200]   No.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.440]   Thanks, Jerry.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.280]   Thanks.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.440]   You said you had an audible pig.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:08.960]   Let's do a quick one.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   I do.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:10.480]   Yep.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.120]   It's funny.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.400]   You know, I'm reading a book.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.240]   And stop me if you've heard this one.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.240]   It's about a startup in a emerging industry
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.320]   that has dedicated-- they have this brilliant idea
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.280]   that they want to talk about one subject 24 hours a day.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.120]   It's a niche subject.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.680]   People don't really get it.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.000]   They say it's going to fail.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Let's say, theoretically, also, that they've decided
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.840]   to build their headquarters north of where everyone says
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.440]   the action is.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:37.960]   This is us.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.240]   That they're out in the sticks.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.240]   This is us.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.640]   That company is ESPN.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.160]   And they are now the most valuable commodity
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.880]   in the Disney organization.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.360]   They are absolutely my role model for what we're doing.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.040]   And yeah.
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.240]   And they have the new book that just came out
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.840]   as written by Andrew Miller.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.960]   I can't wait to read this.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.400]   Tom Shales.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.120]   It's an oral district.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.920]   If you've ever heard their "Saturday Night Live" book,
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.120]   it's just like that.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.040]   I mean, it's a little wonky sports-wise.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.880]   So if you're not--
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.240]   No, but these guys are so creative.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.080]   No, I've got to read this because I think you're right.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.480]   This is the inspiration for what we're doing here.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.480]   And it's funny because I'm coming out of here.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.560]   It's going to be on the show.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560]   And I'm listening to this.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:17.480]   And I'm like, oh my god, there's so many little connectors
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.080]   to this and the Twitch story.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.960]   And they proved a lot of people wrong
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.840]   in the process were really pioneers in terms
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.720]   of getting cable subscriptions.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.160]   It used to be that cable channels would pay in
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.680]   to the cable networks to get their programming on,
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.000]   that it was like the broadcast model.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.560]   And ESPN completely turned that on their head.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.360]   And I'm really going to believe.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.520]   Thank you.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.960]   Those guys have all the fun inside the world of ESPN.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.720]   I did read the "Saturday Night Live" book.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.040]   They did it.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:47.920]   It was fantastic.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.440]   So good.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.400]   I love Tom Shales.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.640]   So I can't wait to get this.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.680]   The only thing I'll say-- and I love Audible.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.600]   Let me just say about Audible, it is a completely runs my life.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.720]   The Audible app, if you don't have it on your phone,
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.960]   you absolutely need to get it.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.520]   And they're just great.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.880]   The only thing I would say about this audio book
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.800]   is that Andrew Miller, who wrote the book,
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.600]   does a lot of the connective narration.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.000]   So he doesn't say talk like this.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.240]   Sometimes it's better to hand it over to the pros.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.480]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.080]   And do that.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:18.720]   But it's not bad.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.400]   Listenable is it.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.400]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.200]   It's good.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.640]   And the content is fantastic.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.960]   It's a long book.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.240]   And a lot of it deals with the early, the forming of the network,
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.080]   as well as the newer stuff, like the Beren Andrew sex tape
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.120]   and all sorts of other things.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:32.960]   He is P.N. Walker.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.440]   That's him.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.360]   Super summer afternoon.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.120]   Berman.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.880]   Practically the network's avatar.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.440]   He's a little gravelly.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.280]   And again, this is clear his throat.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.600]   Well, and there's also a little of few stutters and stops
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.160]   and everything.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:44.880]   That's fine.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:45.280]   It's fine.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.960]   But ESPN, those guys have all the fun.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.240]   Check that out.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.280]   Now you can get it for free.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.960]   Actually, I'm going to give you two books for free.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.080]   If you go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.120]   That's what I do.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.560]   This is the platinum account.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.760]   Two books a month.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.400]   Yes.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.000]   Best way to do it because you pay the subscription price, which
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.720]   is a lot less than the Olichart price.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.680]   And you get two books a month.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.600]   You don't have to listen to them all at once, by the way.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.960]   And this is, as you say, the audible app for Android and iPhone
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.200]   is fantastic because your entire library is on here.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.240]   And so you're just collecting books.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.040]   If you don't read it this month, no problem.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:20.880]   You can get it.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.080]   Like I have Warren Peace.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:22.680]   Look at this.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.320]   Warren Peace is like 18 volumes.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.720]   It's hundreds of hours.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.160]   Robert's holding up the last book I listened to on Audible
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.640]   before I started listening to--
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.360]   What book is that?
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.280]   The ESPN book that--
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:32.640]   Oh.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.080]   --that Steven Leibes in the Plex.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:34.640]   Excellent.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.640]   Which is awesome and amazing.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.920]   And he is one of my favorite, not fiction.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.840]   I'm a huge not fiction guy.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:41.600]   He is great.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.080]   His book about the iPod was fantastic.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.720]   The next new thing or the next?
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.320]   The perfect thing, I believe.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:51.760]   It had my favorite descriptor of Steve Jobs ever, which
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.720]   described him walking into a meeting with all the record
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.440]   companies as they were getting the iTunes stuff together.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.440]   And he walked into the meeting wearing,
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:05.680]   as described by Steven Leiby, in ball high-geen shorts.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.520]   Where were that?
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.240]   It's just my favorite thing ever.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.760]   Whenever I look at Steve Jobs on stage,
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.840]   I'm like, that dude walked into a meeting with record labels
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:15.800]   with ball high-geen shorts.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.600]   Steven Leiby is one of my favorite writers, too,
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.600]   in the Plex, how Google thinks, works, and shapes our lives.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.440]   This is great.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.880]   Some great anecdotes in here.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.040]   There's two books for you.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:24.480]   Boom.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.400]   And they're yours free.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.160]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/twit
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.960]   to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.240]   No charge for the first month.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.600]   You can cancel it any time.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.280]   But two books is enough to get you pretty far down the road.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.880]   I have get this in my library.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.160]   I've been listening since 2000.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.360]   I have 500 books in my library, which is just really--
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.400]   just fantastic.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.320]   If I show all the books, 200 items per page,
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.960]   it still fills up several pages.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.080]   New on the Kindle, by the way, you can also download directly
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.480]   to the Kindle for audible stuff.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:56.960]   Yes.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.440]   That's cool.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:57.880]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.680]   That's very cool.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.440]   Yeah, no, good.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.280]   It's so good.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:01.880]   And it was funny.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   I was at a Barnes & Noble a couple of days ago,
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.760]   and I looked at their books on tape thing.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.760]   And one of the things that really kind of stopped me
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:08.960]   from getting into audible for a while
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.520]   is because I just thought all the things that were lame
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.760]   about books on tape were just kind of transferred--
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.280]   I used to get them to cassettes in the box of cassettes.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.440]   They have that ESPN book on 28 disks--
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.000]   Yes, it's long.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.560]   --for like $45.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.480]   And it's like competing with Audible,
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.080]   where I can download it immediately--
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:25.640]   On your phone?
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.800]   --I have my subscription.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.680]   Boom, on my phone.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.840]   Listen to it immediately.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.960]   It's no contest.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.440]   No contest.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.280]   Audible.com.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.600]   Thank you.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   We thank them for their support.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.280]   So I split two.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.760]   Thank you, jury, for your incredible--
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.920]   you do really good commercials on NSFW.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.800]   Oh, stop.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.680]   You're going to make me blush.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.720]   No, I'm telling you, you're keeping some of our sponsors
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.040]   would have left us long ago.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.600]   I think some may have left because of the sponsor
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.200]   reads of the--
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:48.960]   Well, the mail route, guys.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.320]   Love what you do for theirs.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.440]   I know, but they haven't sponsored sense.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:53.960]   No, no, no.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.440]   We put them on hiatus because we didn't want to overdo it.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:56.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.680]   No, I love doing the mail route.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.480]   The mail route read.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.120]   That was so--
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.200]   Maximum No Spam.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.000]   Maximum No Spam.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.120]   So if you're an NSFW listener, we
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.800]   were going to change the name because we thought people weren't
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.720]   listening to the show because it was not safe for--
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.200]   They thought it-- yeah, they thought it is.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.360]   Hard core.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.640]   But it's completely safe for work.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.200]   It is.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.080]   No, I think we've now changed it colloquially
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.240]   to nominally safe for work.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.720]   I wanted to change the name entirely to something,
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.040]   but we couldn't come up with another name.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:24.720]   No, I know.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.760]   And it's entrenched now.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.400]   It's a great show.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.320]   Brian Brushwood, Justin Robert Young,
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.760]   twit.tv/NSFW.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.440]   And you're going to do a special live edition in moments.
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.000]   Yeah, we're going to be live here in the Twit Studio.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.040]   We're going to Skype Brian in from Maine.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.040]   So we're going to have Jonathan Manned and his song-atron band
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.040]   playing live right here.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:45.520]   We have set up.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.400]   And I feel sad because if you had done this three weeks from now--
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.200]   I know!
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.000]   --and this beautiful stage, and we could set this up--
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.440]   You could be in the big swoopy, the American bandstand.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.040]   I could be Dick Clark.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.480]   The sound board's on the floor.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.760]   I mean, it's going to be horrible.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.720]   No, Jammer Bee has set up--
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.560]   Just because he's working hard to get some points.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.840]   I think Robert wants us to get a little bit into the final cut.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.800]   10, do we have time?
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.880]   Is that what he's showing us?
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.920]   I believe so.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.560]   All right, I got two big stories we're going to cover.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.320]   We've got to talk about Google's antitrust,
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.040]   but let's talk about Final Cut Pro 10.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.560]   Yes.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.480]   Apple on Tuesday surprised everybody, making it available.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:25.120]   We knew it would be available for $300 in the Apple Macintosh App
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.320]   Store.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.560]   They separated motion out.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.400]   That's $50.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.800]   A compressor out $50.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.760]   You all saw the Conan editors take on this in which they said,
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.640]   well, it's the funniest piece I've ever seen.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.440]   Yeah, it's very, very funny.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.000]   I mean, I don't want to spoil a joke.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   Are we going to play it or--
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.840]   Should I play it?
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.560]   You can-- all right, so Conan, of course, on his TBS show,
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.440]   is--
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.080]   plugs in this Final Cut 10 thing.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.000]   Because really, no city is going crazy about this,
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   like LA is because of all the production.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.640]   I thought it was amazing that they felt like it was a mainstream
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.240]   enough story that they could make a joke about it on Conan.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:03.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.320]   And partly it says something about the fractionalization
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.920]   of what we find funny or what he would want to put on there.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.880]   But here, we can just throw it there.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.400]   Final Cut Pro.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.240]   But apparently, it's so different from the last version
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.360]   of Final Cut video and film editors all over Hollywood
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.920]   have been a very hard time adjusting to it, OK?
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.840]   Well, our editors here at Conan are some of the best
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:25.920]   in the business.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.000]   They actually like the new software.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.360]   In fact, they prepared this video statement,
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.960]   voicing their support for the new Final Cut Pro.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.680]   The audience is already laughing.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.360]   Hi, I'm Dave Greick, who one of the editors here at Conan.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.200]   We actually really like the new version of Final Cut Pro.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.200]   We use it to edit the video you're watching right now.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.560]   Hey, this is Dan Dolan, who is from Colorface
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.520]   for Final Cut X's.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.240]   That's the iTunes and I movie All Rights.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.240]   Oh, mess up!
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.000]   That's great.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:57.760]   Hey, my name is Rob.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.600]   You get the idea.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.440]   It will continue on with bad editing, bad titles.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.600]   Robert, you disagree?
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600]   No.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.760]   Is it terrible?
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.200]   It depends how you're coming at it.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.360]   I actually like Final Cut Pro because I'm not
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.960]   a professional video editor.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.800]   My producer, on the other hand, who does edit my editing,
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.960]   he hates it.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.440]   And--
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:17.920]   Really?
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.400]   Well, it doesn't have multi-camera support.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.600]   It doesn't take in files from the old version.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.440]   It didn't have some exports he needed and stuff like that.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.960]   That was the worst thing.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.720]   And if you have any legacy stuff, anything you've
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.200]   edited in Final Cut Pro studio, you can't open it.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.080]   Totally rewrite.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.680]   My main problem with it is that they should have called it
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.840]   something else.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.200]   I movie Pro.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:45.600]   Or Final Cut Express, which is a product they've replaced,
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.840]   which is the same price.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.560]   And really, this is a logical replacement for that.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.160]   Well, I think that's the biggest thing,
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.640]   is for professionals who love Final Cut and live on Final Cut.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.920]   This was a super jarring thing.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.520]   I think David Poe actually did a great job of sort of listing,
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.000]   separating what actually is not on Final Cut X
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.280]   and what is just harder to get to.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.560]   Well, basically he asked Apple and Apple gave him information
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.800]   and he put it in on his--
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.920]   Well, I mean, I thought it was a pretty good resource.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.760]   I did some original--
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.440]   It's a good resource.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.000]   It's kind of an apologist for Apple, but that's all right.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:16.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.840]   It's good information.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.360]   Let me just say, I did some original reporting for Twit.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:20.840]   Yes.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.800]   And I have a bunch of friends because I've worked--
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.960]   me and Andrew have worked in television before.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.840]   We did G4's G4 Underground documentary series.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.680]   You worked at G4?
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.760]   You can't be here.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.320]   We'll see you later.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320]   Oh, come on.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:32.820]   Come on.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:33.600]   No, don't worry.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.280]   We have very similar experiences.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.000]   But I made a lot of friends and I emailed one of them--
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.240]   or sorry, I texted one of them.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.560]   And I asked to ask around to some of her professional editor
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.080]   friends to describe Final Cut X in one word.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.440]   So these are all editors for NBC discovery--
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.120]   Professionals.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.480]   Professional editors.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.720]   We have-- does WTF count as one word?
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.760]   Nice try, Apple.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.160]   Put into one word.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.000]   And then apparently 14 people saying a word that I can't
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   say on Twit.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.200]   But as B-U-L-L and then ends with IT.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.800]   So not exactly happy.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.880]   The LA editing community.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.320]   I thought this was interesting.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.400]   Daniel Jugkert, who is an Apple developer who does--
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.600]   I live on Mars Edit.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:17.160]   Yep, Mars Edit.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.240]   I live on Mars Edit.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.080]   Red sweater software.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.120]   I thought the tweet that kind of said it all.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.720]   He said, Apple will happily piss off 5,000 professionals
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.480]   to please 5 million amateurs.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.920]   Is that what happened, Robert?
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.640]   I think so, but they really screwed up by naming it.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.040]   Because the amateurs, like me, who came through iMovie,
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.440]   we don't care that it's Final Cut Pro.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.080]   Although that did get me to download it.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.480]   It's been three and three hours.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.320]   Well, that's part of the value proposition.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:44.480]   What?
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.440]   This was $1,200.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.280]   Now it's only $300.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.160]   I'm going to buy it even if I don't need it.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.800]   Yeah, except it doesn't do what Final Cut did.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.280]   I mean, I use two cameras on my show,
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.000]   and it's hard to use that.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.280]   Well, David Polk says you could still do a two camera.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.320]   OK.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.400]   Multi-camera cut.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.720]   All you have to do is put them both in the timeline.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.800]   And then whatever you cut out will show up in the second thing.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.480]   It's not that hard.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.000]   You know, it's like, come on, Apple.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:08.680]   Just admit it.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.520]   You took it out.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:12.360]   I think, yeah, it was rush out.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.160]   I mean, Apple deserves to catch out on this
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.400]   and the same one that they deserve to catch
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.920]   out on the mobile me stuff when that was completely
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:20.920]   not functional.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.960]   But I think the final word has not
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.440]   been written on Final Cut 10.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.000]   I'd be very curious to see where it is in time.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:27.960]   You come out from Mind Movie.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.360]   It's faster than iMovie.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.760]   The quality is better than iMovie.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.240]   And it has a lot more features than iMovie.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.240]   Of course, it's $300 instead of-- how much did iMovie cost us?
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.240]   $50 or something.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240]   Well, it's free.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240]   It's free.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.400]   It's free, yeah, on the new Mac.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.400]   I mean, I will say, like Robert, but everybody's like, oh,
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.240]   whatever.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:47.000]   We should be iMovie Pro.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.760]   And I'm such a noob.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.160]   I'm like, hmm, really?
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:49.680]   Sounds great.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680]   iMovie Pro.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.000]   I'll take it.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.280]   Well, we're going to talk about this quite a bit on Mac
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.720]   Break Weekly, as you might imagine.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.040]   It came out the day Mac Break Weekly came out
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.120]   so we talked a little bit about it,
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.760]   but we hadn't had much chance to use it.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.360]   Alex Lindsey's Pixelcord did a whole evening on it
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.480]   on Thursday.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:09.320]   Larry Jordan, who is considered by many
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.680]   to be the god of Final Cut, one of the most accomplished
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.320]   Final Cut trainers out there will join us Tuesday on Mac Break
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.000]   Weekly.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.720]   And we will talk about the good, the bad,
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.560]   and the ugly with Final Cut Pro 10.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:20.160]   Nice.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:22.120]   This is just-- to me, this is Apple.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.080]   This is what Apple does.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.000]   Apple is completely willing, at any time, to say, hey,
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.560]   see you later past.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.560]   Welcome to the future.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.720]   And if it pisses some people off, it does.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.960]   That's both their strength and in some ways a weakness.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.480]   It's part of their arrogance.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.480]   And I think this is what makes Apple Apple.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.680]   I never see Microsoft do that.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:40.760]   Well--
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.080]   This is a complete rewrite.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.320]   It works on multi-core machines a lot better than--
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.000]   It's Coco.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.520]   It's 64-bit.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.400]   But it'll take a year or two for them
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.800]   to react to all the complaints and get the features back.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.280]   Well, that was mostly what the David Polk--
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:58.160]   a poll-- appelogia said was.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.320]   Oh, no, apology.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.360]   Apology.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.280]   It said--
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.000]   Well, no, they're going to tell you in Sydney.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000]   They're going to add that.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000]   Yeah, it is.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]   Apology.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.200]   Apology.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.200]   It's a neo-triest.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.880]   He said basically, oh, they're going to add that.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.600]   They're going to add that.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.240]   Or you're going to third party app for that.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.920]   There were very few cases where he said, no,
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.120]   we're not going to ever do that.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.680]   I mean, the only thing I would disagree with you, Leo,
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.560]   is I think that by and large, Apple
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.280]   is better at shipping a more polished final product than this.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.320]   I think this stands a part of them kind of--
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:29.800]   Isn't it?
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.440]   Isn't it really crazy?
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.000]   Here's another complaint I have about Apple
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.600]   since we're bitching about Apple.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:33.960]   All right.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.240]   I have a brand new 27-inch monitor.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.080]   Sexy.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.200]   Brand new 27-inch iMac.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.160]   Look, they don't--
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:41.720]   They don't match.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.000]   Match up.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.280]   You know what I'm glad you told me that,
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.520]   because I was going to buy the exact same setup you just
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.880]   bought for the new studio, because I thought they would match.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.440]   Now I'm just going to use a TV set.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.840]   Well, use a TV set or get some Ergatron arms.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.880]   So behind here I have some Ergatron arms,
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.600]   and I'm going to work on that.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.800]   In fact, that was what we were just looking at.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.880]   So there's a visa you could pull off the stand on the iMac,
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.360]   and then you can visa mount something on there.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.200]   Is that how--
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.480]   And then you're not set on the table anymore.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.040]   You're set on these arms, and you can arrange them.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.600]   And also, you can use verticals.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.560]   I'm going to get a second 27-inch monitor,
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.520]   so I can do two vertical monitors next to my horizontal iMac.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:24.080]   You're not having children again, I take it.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.400]   Why do I need-- I have three babies.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.240]   I don't need more, man.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.440]   This is my solution for birth control.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.800]   I'll just have three monitors.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.760]   There we go.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.240]   Three, and I have a fourth one over here, and a Mac.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.240]   You don't want to take any chances, obviously.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:40.760]   No.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.880]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.560]   And a 65-inch big screen.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.560]   So that's one of them all.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.080]   It's just got a 50-monitor buccanalia going on in his office.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.920]   My goal is to keep up with Leo, because Leo's
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.360]   getting this huge studio.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.920]   I don't have that, so I'm going to have as much glass
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.120]   around me as Leo does.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.600]   You were going to have a long road to-ho after that studio.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.680]   And actually, I'm going the other direction.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.960]   We're going to have fewer monitors in my new office,
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.960]   my new studio, because I do want to have children.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:11.160]   And if anybody is interested, just let me know.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.560]   So--
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.200]   Couple of quick stories.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:17.120]   Leave your number on a Twitbrick, which you can buy at bricks.twit.tv.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.720]   I'm buying those bricks, then.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:19.880]   Good.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.440]   I hope you do.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.200]   I hope you all--
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.280]   Just do one quick rhythm before we wrap up the Final Cut Pro.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.280]   I think in "Faire's Fair," Pogue did call the Final Cut 10
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.720]   thing a bad launch and a botched launch.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.280]   So--
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.080]   Good.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:30.640]   Good.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.240]   Good for you, David.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:36.480]   What are you laughing at?
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:39.120]   I just really want to know how you feel about David's Pro.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:39.960]   You know what, David?
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.280]   To believe it or not, David's an old friend.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.080]   I really like David.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.280]   But I have to say, when I think Walt Mossberg and David
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.840]   Pogue, I just turn green with envy,
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.320]   because apparently they're willing to do anything
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.520]   to keep Apple on their good side and get the free products.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.600]   Well, because they didn't hold up an iMac
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   and record Steve Jobs and--
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.560]   Can you imagine David or Walt doing there?
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.320]   Oh, of course not.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.840]   Well, I mean, you use--
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.840]   Isn't that what you do?
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.640]   If you're a journalist, you try to get the story.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.320]   And specifically one that has a live streaming network that
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.080]   is covering a live--
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.280]   I'm trying to do that.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:14.880]   No, no.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.800]   They're the right--
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:20.120]   I think the measure of Walt's allegiance--
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.880]   And I've switched from Pogue to Mossberg.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.520]   But the measure of Walt's allegiance--
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.160]   Did you have to declare?
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.120]   No, you don't.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.600]   The measure.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.440]   Yes, eight ball in the corner pocket.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.560]   Steve Jobs, eight ball in the corner pocket.
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.040]   No.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.400]   I'm on Team Walt.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:36.320]   Team Walt, baby.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.920]   Mossberg!
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.920]   I got the Pogue Man.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.720]   So is the way he treated Steven Sonofsky of Microsoft
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.840]   when he was talking about Windows 8.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.640]   Now that we've seen the video, not a very friendly
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.800]   reception to Microsoft on the stage of all things D.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.840]   And I have to feel like it was just a little bit of bias,
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.840]   to be honest, on his--
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.280]   I mean, it's hard.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.040]   I mean, I think in general with journalism,
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.240]   we do ourselves into services, readers,
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.560]   to think that anybody is truly objective.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.400]   Everybody has their points of view.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.720]   Everybody has their biases.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.440]   And if you think that you can go to one place and just be like,
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.200]   well, they tell it like it is, then you're always
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:14.960]   going to be fooling yourself.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.560]   And you're always going to be disappointed at the end of the day.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.040]   You read everything that you can and then
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.480]   make your own decision on it.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.640]   You agree, Om?
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.840]   I mean, I think you adhere to an extremely high standard
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.760]   of journalist integrity.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.960]   I don't know what Walt and David
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.320]   do with or how they interact with Apple.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.000]   But I think from my perspective, the way I see it,
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.200]   you just have to do the right thing every single time.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.640]   You're, as a writer, your only allegiance is to the readers.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.440]   That's it.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.480]   You know, sometimes, yes, you have your own biases
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.200]   and opinions.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.440]   I mean, and you've got to let people know
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.680]   that those are your personal biases and opinions.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.760]   And that's all.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.720]   People are smart.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.920]   Readers are smart.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.840]   They know what to take at face value
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.120]   and what to take with the grain of thought.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.960]   I think we kind of tend to overgeneralize
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.960]   and don't give readers that much respect.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:24.400]   I personally believe that our readers are smarter than the writers
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.160]   themselves, period.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.480]   That's the end of story, in my opinion.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.640]   If you have to make sure that you're
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:35.520]   living up to their expectations every single time.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:38.600]   And it doesn't have to be about a story.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.280]   The fact everything has to be measured with that lens.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:48.120]   So sometimes, you don't succeed, but also the time one
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.720]   has to aim for that.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.760]   And I think that's what all our senior guys do,
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:59.000]   whether it's POG or Walter or Markov or you.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.520]   We've learned from guys like you.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.920]   So we can't really say anything but the other way.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.400]   I mean, I've seen you guys, how you've done it.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.400]   And I've basically taken a cue from all of you.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.640]   So you've got-- you've actually got it.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.560]   Done a great job.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.760]   My job in any of us is--
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.240]   It's fantastic.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.000]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:18.520]   You go home.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:19.520]   You go home.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:20.520]   You go home.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.280]   We have to pay that forward, too.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:27.320]   We have to always remind our younger writers
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.040]   that it's all about the readers.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:32.240]   And they're the one who pay the bill to make sure.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.360]   I almost want to print that on the wall.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.680]   Who is our constituency?
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.160]   It is the user.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.640]   It is our viewers.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.480]   And that's who you serve.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.960]   You don't serve anybody else.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.560]   Sometimes hard in trade press because you end up
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.840]   having such close relationships with the companies
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:51.760]   that you cover that you forget who you're really advocating for.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.960]   Although I will say, I think it's great when people of stature
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.680]   go after other people of stature.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.240]   Because I think it does keep everybody honest.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.800]   And I think it's good that we're always thinking about what
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.320]   is the information out there.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.880]   How can it be dissected?
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.200]   And are we getting the best out of it?
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.840]   And I think that only happened when we talk about it.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.720]   People are beating up on Walt right now.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.120]   But it's fair to give Microsoft a tough time.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.600]   They had the tablet, I sold tablets at Microsoft for three
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.240]   years long before the iPad came out.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.960]   And it was always done half-astly.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.160]   And if you look at Windows 8 and look at the demos
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.680]   that they showed on screen, there was a lot of flash up front.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:33.320]   But then they dug into Excel and it looked crappy again.
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.400]   And that's where it dies.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.720]   And the bias that we all have in this industry--
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:42.080]   and it's a tough bias to sometimes discern--
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.760]   is we're surrounded by people who keep feeding us back
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.400]   what equipment is hot in this industry or not,
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.720]   or what's going on.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.860]   And I just had a guy over at my house
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:55.880]   who used to be one of the guys at Microsoft that I look up to.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.000]   Or look at Charles Fitzgerald at VMware.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.120]   All these guys are Mac users now.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.560]   And so these are former high-level executives from Microsoft.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.880]   I used to work at Microsoft.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.000]   And look around.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.040]   I have all Apple equipment.
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.360]   There's a reason for that.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.600]   And that bias comes through on stage.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.880]   The reason is because we can afford it.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.640]   Well, it's not just afford it.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.360]   It's passionate.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.280]   When I talk to audiences around the world who
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.400]   are tech-passionates, they have Macs.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.280]   They spend that extra money because it works better.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.680]   If you don't care about your equipment so much,
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.480]   or if you can't afford it, then you're
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:35.720]   more likely to be a Windows user still.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:38.800]   Chris Forsman, running in the Infinite Loop column at Ours
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:40.760]   Technica, which is a great column.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.200]   According to sources within Apple's supply chain production,
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.720]   for the MacBook Air will increase in July 17% over June
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.960]   and could increase as much as 100% for the third quarter.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.720]   Apple is expecting incredible demand for this supposed MacBook
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.880]   Air model that they will release with Lion.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.720]   It'll be running a Sandy Bridge.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.960]   We'll have Thunderbolt, obviously, in it.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.520]   They think the MacBook Air will be the computer
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.040]   of the second half of 2011.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.760]   Hey, Renish, this coming now?
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.160]   Well, no one knows, do they?
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:14.600]   But--
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.560]   Now people, the chat room's going white hot on me right now.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.800]   They are totally eating me up.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.880]   That's why you're here, Robert.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.080]   Yeah, from the chat room in Kanye voice,
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.600]   Scoble doesn't care about Windows people.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.840]   I mean, go to VMware.
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:32.760]   They were 99% Mac, the whole engineering team.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.280]   Go look at my photos of the Facebook engineering team.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.840]   95% Mac.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:37.920]   Go to the Lyft conference.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:40.920]   I had people raise their hands over in Geneva, Switzerland,
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.680]   a European conference, not in the Valley.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.880]   95% Mac.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:46.800]   TedX or Ted, you go there.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.160]   It's mostly Mac.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.280]   I went to the World Economic Forum, and I counted a lot of iPads,
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:55.880]   a lot of Macs, not so many Dell machines, not so many PCs.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.600]   So that's where my biases come from,
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:01.160]   and I can go more into why I buy Macs.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:05.360]   But I'm getting the feedback from the industry itself,
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.560]   not from my own biases.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.840]   Somebody says, oh, Rackspace competes with that.
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.240]   Microsoft, oh, give me a break.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.200]   No.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.360]   Rackspace is a little pimple on Microsoft's ass
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:13.840]   in terms of--
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.080]   But it is a religious war.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:15.840]   We don't want to get into it.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:15.840]   No.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.680]   Because it's just--
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:16.680]   No.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.880]   You can never make anybody happy.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:20.160]   But one thing we all agree on, you really
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.680]   got to burn that hat, Justin.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.080]   It's just--
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.400]   Oh, come on.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:24.680]   It's just really--
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.040]   I can smell it from here.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:26.640]   So I just--
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.520]   Come on, 2009 Cub Champions, Pittsburgh--
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.720]   I-- this one?
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.480]   Talk about burying the lead.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.720]   What is the big news story of the week?
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.680]   The FTC filing antitrust action against Google,
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.960]   and did we get to it today?
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.480]   No, we didn't.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.400]   We'll talk about it next week.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:41.680]   Thank you.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:43.160]   Thank you.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:43.520]   I don't know.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.320]   Is there anything to say about this?
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.360]   I don't know.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.200]   It's Sunday, man.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.600]   Time to chill out now.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.400]   Let's kick up our feet.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.840]   This is a story that's going to go for at least a decade.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.760]   So we'll have plenty of time to talk about it.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.160]   The only thing I want to say about it
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.360]   is Scobos holding up the "In the Plex" book.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.400]   If you haven't read that book, please read it.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:07.040]   To me, the moral of it was what happens if you have
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.680]   this audacious dream?
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:12.840]   It comes absolutely true beyond your wildest comprehension.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.120]   And then you have to deal with it.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.400]   And I think that's what's happening right now with Google.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.120]   They've followed their path, and there's complications to it.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.000]   It's a challenge.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.360]   It is.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:24.880]   It is a great book.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.200]   We had Steven Levy on this week in Google about a month ago
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.160]   talking about the book, some great stories in there.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.080]   It's an amazing book.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.000]   Well written.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.480]   I agree with you on that.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.680]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.680]   There's a lot more news.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.320]   We didn't get to all of it.
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.640]   But we did have a great time.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.200]   And frankly, when you have people of this caliber on--
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.440]   well, with the exclusion of you, Jeremy.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:43.920]   Of course.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.880]   Yeah, sure.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.160]   Well, I was joking on Twitter that the guest panel was two
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.720]   and a half men this week.
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:50.960]   So--
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.960]   No.
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.040]   You know, I love you.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.640]   You're the greatest Justin Robert Young NSFW.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.120]   Stay tuned.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.680]   We're going to have a live NSFW with music.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.880]   Coming up in just a bit.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:00.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.520]   And also, I just want to give a quick plug.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.720]   Andrew Mains-- we didn't get to talk about eBooks,
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.880]   but he's got a dollar e-book.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:10.680]   If you like science fiction, it's brand new in Amazon.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:12.680]   Just go to the chronological man.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:14.480]   Just search for chronological man.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.280]   If you like sci-fi, it's basically a Sherlock Holmes.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.400]   Meets, Tony Stark, Meets, Doctor Who kind of story.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:22.280]   You'll really, really dig it.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.640]   So download that The Chronological Man on Amazon.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:26.320]   And I love this.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.880]   And I hope you'll talk a little bit about this.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.360]   But this is the thing to do now is these 99 cent Buck 99--
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:31.880]   Yep.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.640]   --eBooks--
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.640]   --they sell like crazy.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.480]   John Locke is a guy who-- it was the first million ebook
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.640]   seller that was announced this week.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:41.680]   Amanda Hawking--
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:44.680]   She just signed a deal with St. Martin's Press.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.240]   I mean, this is really the way to go.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.840]   99 cents The Chronological Man, the Monster in the Mist.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.320]   And then also speaking of audiobooks,
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.920]   Andrew Maine's first book, The Grendel Shadow,
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.080]   I did a audiobook recording for you.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.440]   Because you download that at AndrewMaine.com/books.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.480]   And I just finished the audiobook.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:03.880]   And boy is it a monster, eight and a half hours
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:06.480]   for his full-length novel, Public Enemy Zero,
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.520]   which will be out this week.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.680]   So check that out, AndrewMaine.com/books.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.280]   Is he your best friend forever?
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.600]   He's my BFF.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.040]   It's like Chewbacca.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.960]   I owe him a life debt.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:20.440]   So I want to thank Robert Scoble for being here.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.760]   The Scobleizer is always great, always interesting,
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.320]   always has something to say.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.600]   Hopefully all the Microsoft fans will let me back on the show.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.560]   I'll call on.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.200]   You know, we got a lot of heat because I also agree.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.680]   I did give a free pass to Windows 8.
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.400]   And we talked a lot about it with Devorak a couple of weeks
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.600]   ago on Twitter and got a lot of heat.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.800]   But you got to call a spade a spade.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.920]   And in this case, we don't know.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:44.040]   We won't see it for another year and a half.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.240]   But when it does come out, I think then we can deal with it.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.160]   I agree with you.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.600]   I think there's some problems for sure.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.240]   Scobleizer.com, the place to go.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:55.680]   But you got to see his videos at Building43.com.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.680]   He does such a great job covering the tech industry,
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.400]   inspiring stuff.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.720]   And finally, the great Om Malek, who is easily the smartest
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.360]   man in tech today, Om Malek.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.040]   Remember that name?
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.320]   You can see him at a coffee shop and a nightclub
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.520]   in Amazon bookstore near you someday soon.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.480]   You said it would happen.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.640]   You said it would.
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.200]   gigaom.com.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.560]   Now you're head over the wall, Om.
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.200]   Come on.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:23.760]   All right, all right.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.960]   Double down.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.720]   Thanks for being home, hero.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.960]   It was as always a great pleasure.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.160]   He's one of my favorite Omies.
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:35.160]   I'm glad I am.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:35.520]   All right.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:36.440]   Hey, thanks for being here.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:37.720]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.320]   Don't forget we still got bricks to sell.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.240]   Lots of them.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.160]   Don't send me a brick.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.600]   I don't need you to send me a brick.
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.320]   When I say buy a brick, I don't mean buy it
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.960]   at your arch and supply hardware
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.360]   and send it to me.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.680]   I mean, go to bricks.twit.tv and buy a brick,
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.600]   a commemorative brick.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.080]   You put it up on the wall.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.800]   It could say anything you want.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.480]   And we'll have a wonderful foyer
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.360]   where everybody gets to visit their bricks.
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:04.680]   bricks.twit.tv last couple of weeks of our brick sale
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:06.480]   to help build the new Twit Brickhouse.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.640]   We're very excited about this.
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.120]   We do Twit every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m.

[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.480]   If you miss a show, you can always catch up with them
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.800]   at Twit.tv.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.360]   We've got live programming on almost all the time.

[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.120]   because you never know what you're going to catch

[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.400]   Yeah, on the NSFW show.
