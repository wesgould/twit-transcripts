[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.320]   Yeah, I just made it up.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.040]   Also here, formerly of revision three, another great friend
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.200]   from Tech TV, many, many years.

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920]   but not in any sense that I know of.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.480]   Oh, good.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.080]   All right.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.600]   Did you and he talk about the election?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   Because you predicted McCain.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.320]   Yeah, two years ago, I was close.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.400]   You came as close as you can get.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.360]   Well, without hitting it.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.760]   But I was thinking it was going to be McCain Hillary election.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.160]   And then Barack flipped it.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.720]   And that was--
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.600]   Could have predicted Barack Obama two years ago.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.760]   Right after Iowa.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.120]   And I won $100 off that bet.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.680]   Did you?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.200]   From some guy at the bar.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.080]   Put your microphone closer to your lips.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.520]   You can actually bend it.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.400]   Yeah, you can bend it.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   You won't hurt it.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.040]   It's a bendable microphone.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.600]   Also here, I'm really glad to get him on.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.920]   It's not dead.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   We've had him on TV many times, but we've never had him on Twitter.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.400]   Sorry.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   Am I going to have to slap you two around?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.360]   No.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   We have never had--
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.760]   I thought Joe-- I thought Joe and his supposed to correct the whip
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.120]   and keep them in tune.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240]   I think because I'm in the same room as them.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.600]   And it'll be my physical--
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.920]   It's going to be tough.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.440]   I don't want to take the blame for this.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.240]   Too late.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.120]   I'm not going to have anything to say.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.920]   And by the way, I should just tell you--
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   Steve and Martin and Sarah and anybody else listening,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.960]   anytime John C. de Vorex says de Vorex.org/blog,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.040]   you must take a break.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.520]   And John, we're counting on you now.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.200]   OK, I'll get him.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   That's what I'm driving.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.480]   So be nice, de Vorex.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.120]   You can always have somebody else driving.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.040]   You don't think you have a car service?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.520]   No, but we will next time, I think.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   You know, I waited.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.760]   I waited and waited.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960]   And that service never came.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.800]   I'm so sorry.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.440]   So I had to get this in.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.920]   We have a little bedroom upstairs.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.840]   There's a cloth foot tub.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.040]   You can be very comfortable.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.960]   I like that bathroom.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.560]   Isn't that cute?
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.480]   It's really cute.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.680]   Steve Bass is formerly a PC world and now of techbite.com.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.800]   He's another one of the Pink Slip Army on the show today.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.120]   But you're still contributing editors.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.200]   So you still have a role in PC world.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.120]   Yeah, they came back and they said, listen,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.160]   we want you on the Masshead because it'll cost you money
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.280]   to take you off the Masshead.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.120]   So stay on.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.040]   They didn't want to do the type setting.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.680]   That's it.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.840]   That's it.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.760]   But no, really, they are hiring.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.440]   It's $6.5 an hour.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.800]   So any of you who want can jump on in.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.560]   Any of you in India looking for work?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   Well, that's what they're going to be using soon.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.040]   Yeah, they're going to outsource.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.680]   So what happened?
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.720]   Who got laid off over there?
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.440]   What was the rationale?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   Well, because people might be listening.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.200]   I can't say what the real rationale is.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.160]   But some people are saying that Pat McGovern needs
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.680]   to keep food on his table.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.160]   He's IDG.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.040]   He's PC-roll.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.120]   Yeah, I know Pat personally.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   By the way, he's just--
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.440]   Well, send him money from Texas.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   He'll send him money from Texas.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.720]   He'll loan to keep food on his table for the next 100 years.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.080]   But OK.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.160]   Yeah, yeah, him and Shelley.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.600]   But beyond that, it was Dan Tine and Steve Manis, me.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I just heard that Stuart Johnson, the bugs and fixes guy,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.240]   also got nailed two, three days ago.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.560]   This is not a good time to be in the print business.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.600]   Or even in the online business.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.720]   Really?
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.400]   Oh, boy.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.120]   Because all of us need replace.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.760]   I'm not in the online business.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.480]   Not really.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.240]   You are.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.600]   But you're Leo.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.320]   Yeah, I can't fire myself.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.840]   That's right.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.000]   I'm in the twin business.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.800]   I'm in the twin business.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.760]   That's Bona McCall.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.000]   Hello, Bona.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.800]   Hey, Leo.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.360]   How's it going?
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   It's great to have you.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.440]   Bona is a social media gadfly.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.800]   Is that a good way to describe you?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   OK.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.000]   Bona.org.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.920]   Let's go with that.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.040]   I first noticed you maybe a year ago
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   and probably was on Twitter.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.280]   Then I see you everywhere now.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.640]   And friend fly on social media.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.280]   I'm a social media junkie.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.360]   I'm not too proud of that.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   But that's good that you found me there, Leo.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.880]   And it's great.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.600]   I've been wanting to get you on for some time.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.960]   So it's great to have you.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.440]   Yeah, but the important thing, Leo, is his hiring.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.880]   Are you hiring, Wanna?
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.000]   Yeah, I am.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.160]   I don't pay very well, but I'm hiring.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.920]   $650 an hour.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.880]   Hey, listen.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.640]   You go to seven and I'm with you, pal.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.520]   And it is tough times all around.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   I have to say, but we'll see what happens in the long run.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.200]   Hey, John, what's the name of the plug?
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.240]   Oh, come on now.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.320]   That's pretty cool because I'm--
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   It's really in the show.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.120]   I am not taking the bait.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.720]   I want to--
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.080]   I think it's pathetic that someone would just
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.720]   keep plugging their product over and over and over again.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.880]   And I'm not going to take part in that kind of thing.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.960]   But since you asked, davork.org/blog, have a drink.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   We're going to drink it.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.040]   Cheers to all.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   Ah, that's good.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.280]   So, I'll give you a pathetic.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480]   You want pathetic?
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.160]   I want pathetic.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.400]   You want pathetic?
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.120]   So Google says to Yahoo, the Department of Justice,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.840]   just a little too hot right now.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.880]   That ad deal we were talking about, forget about it.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.720]   So Jerry Yang at the Web 2.0 summit says,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.240]   you know, I think it'd be a really good thing for Microsoft
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.120]   to acquire Yahoo.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   He still thinks so.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   This is so pathetic.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   That was bad.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   How high did that offer get?
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   33 bucks?
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.120]   33.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.120]   He wanted 37.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.720]   And what is Yahoo at now?
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   12?
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   Heading for under 10.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   And he still has a job.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.120]   This is what's amazing to me.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120]   It's this company.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Yeah, but why is it--
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   Can I interrupt here and just just say what I keep saying
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   over and over and over again?
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.120]   If that deal ever goes through at any price whatsoever,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   the E you would kill it.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.600]   It would never really consummate.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.280]   So I think the whole thing is academic.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.520]   And that's really what happened with the Google Yahoo thing, right?
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   It wasn't Google saying, oh, hey, let's pretend it.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   Hey, offer Yahoo a bailout.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.360]   Then Microsoft will go away and then we can pull the rug out from
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   under him.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   It's really kind of a Lucy moment pulling the--
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   What did your Peter Laurie show up?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   I don't know.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   I might have to do it.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   He fizzed.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   Oh, gosh.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   I'm wearing a fizz.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   I wasn't--
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   I was--
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   I was--
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   That was Balmer.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   You have an audience.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   And so now you're bringing in new voices.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.680]   Yeah, I'll bring in new voices at a drop of a hat or a fizz,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.120]   if the case might be.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.360]   You look like Croucho Marx.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   I swear.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.760]   It's probably the cigar in the black mustache.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.840]   What does Sarah Lane look like?
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.640]   She's wearing a cowgirl hat.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.560]   Oh, Sarah Jessica Parker.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   Really?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   No, no, no.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.440]   Sarah Jessica's not looking that good these days,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   to be honest with you.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.560]   Well, I mean, you know, I know that he says I look, you know,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   40 something.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.160]   You're much less equine.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   Thank you.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   Equine.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   There's a good word.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   That's the part that looks like an equine.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   Equine is--
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.760]   Oh, I've heard that, though.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760]   Poor scene.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.560]   Equine is a very good word to say.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   Poor is this happy.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   He plays some notes.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   He goes slightly molds on their chin.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.960]   See, now this one's supposed to jump in and say, we're
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.360]   supposed to be talking about tech.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   Yeah, what happened to--
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   Oh, that's a good job.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Good job.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   Good job.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   Thank you.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   It's true.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   It's true.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.840]   You've got a little white, a little pink thing on your cheek.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   That's his mic.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   That's his mic he phone.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.240]   And it is giving him that Sarah Jessica Parker look.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   We're going to give him the US Coast Guard Chiefs hat.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   That's a real life Chiefs hat.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   That's--
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   That's a mighty hat already.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.840]   You can snap off a salute and that sucker and man.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.240]   I'm ready to set sail skipper.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   I'm like that one.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.640]   I'd ride your boat.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.840]   So what about technology?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   Yahoo.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   That's off.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   Google, how long before the Yahoo! stockholders finally boot this guy?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   What are they going to do when they boot them?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.240]   They're going to put it into some other loser like they had before.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   I mean, I don't see that it's going to help at all.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   But they got to--
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   It's hard.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   It's bare down and sell ads.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   So it's hopeless.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   Now it's not a hopeless--
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   This is a multi-billion dollar company.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   They have huge revenues.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   They're even profitable.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.760]   Yeah, they just have to bare down and keep their eye on the ball and do all these cliched
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.240]   things and just get out of this idea of, you know, right now nobody's in their growth.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.040]   I mean, look at-- you're talking about this?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.840]   Look at Intel.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.240]   It's like $14.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.840]   I mean, and they're moaning about the price of the Yahoo! stock.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   Come on.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   It's $14.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   Yeah, go buy some.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   It's a bargain.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840]   Yeah, it is.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   It is.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   As soon as I get some work from Bwanna.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   Who's the bargain?
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.240]   Who's the bargain out there?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.840]   Is Google a bargain now?
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.320]   No, I don't think-- what you want to look at if you really want to look at, at least for
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.240]   the technical bargains and the classic tradition, go to Yahoo! and try to find out what the
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.680]   peg, the price earnings to growth ratio is and look for that number.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.880]   And anything that's got under one is a bargain.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.720]   Everything over one is not a bargain.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   And Yahoo! is over one.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.560]   So actually the stock should go down more.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.160]   And what is Intel's?
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.080]   Borland's stock must be pretty good.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   Borland's good.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   Yeah, good buy right now.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   Okay.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   You know, actually, you say that, but Philippe Condit, okay, because he invented-- I remember
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.840]   we had him on the screensabers-- the technology that every camera phone uses.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.360]   Yeah, no, he's been made-- I talked to him recently too.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.520]   He's made out.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.200]   He's got to be a billionaire now.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   He's close.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.600]   Every time I see him on Facebook, he says, "He's got a new sailboat," or "He's got a
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   new Ferrari."
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   Who would have thought that?
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   I've been more than thanked.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.560]   Or a new wife.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.040]   But you know, it shows you, you want to make money, be an infrastructure, right?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.280]   Or work for Philippe Condit or Buonamacal.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   Yeah, well, I'm waiting for him to give me a buzz.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   So Yahoo!
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.480]   His P2E is 18.3 to 1.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   Well, that's the P-E, but you're the one to peg.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   P-E-G.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.480]   That's different than GE.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.160]   Yeah, the price earnings is-- the peg is-- the old thinking is that your price earnings should
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.040]   reflect your growth rate.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.520]   And the peg is actually that number.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.040]   And one means your price earnings reflects the growth rate right on the money.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.200]   And anything over one means that your growth rate is lower than your price earnings.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   And so the stock should be technically overpriced, but there may be something afoot.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.280]   And then anything under one means that your growth rate is high, but your price earnings
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   is low.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   It's a bargain.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.600]   Technically, unless the whole world's going to collapse, the one to look at for that, by
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.920]   the way, if you're looking for something to eyeball is US Steel.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.480]   What's their peg?
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   Point two.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   Wow.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.760]   But isn't all the steel moving off shore to Japan?
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.880]   No, no, it's moving-- most of it's going to India, but it's not that US Steel doesn't
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   have interest there.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.960]   And US Steel is so boring.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   I mean--
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   Yeah, well, there you go.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   There you have it.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.960]   What a--
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   I want to buy Apple.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   Apple's fun.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   Apple's cool.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   Apple's got an iPhone.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   Right.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   So talking about--
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   So talking about sexy, something provocative and US Steel.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.800]   That's the problem.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.240]   So anyway, it was when we were talking about something to buy and something sexy and not
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   boring.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.960]   So I go to Costco.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   And I really haven't priced laptops recently.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   Oh, man.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.040]   You can get $200 laptops now.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.840]   Well, they had a loaded-- a beautiful loaded and enameled in kind of a red candy apple
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.560]   gateway, Vista machine with a big screen, 15-something inches.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.520]   And it was fairly light for like $5.99.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.760]   Yeah, but John, John, the problem is they shrink wrap four of them.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.720]   You have to buy it on a toilet.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.520]   Oh, that's the deal.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.560]   And they throw in a case of toilet paper.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.120]   Intel's peg is 1.46.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   It's in the ballpark.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   No, that's fine.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.480]   As long as it's not over like two.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.160]   Here's a great bug.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.520]   I tried this on my G1, the Google phone.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   Oh, reboot?
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   Did it work?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.400]   So they-- in the Google phone that came out-- and I guess they're shipping a patch at some
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   point.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.680]   Some of the phones already have it.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   I guess they're pushing it and rolling it out.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   Mine doesn't.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.400]   I got one patch, but it didn't fix this.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   They left some switch on that everything you type-- everything you type from the keyboard
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   goes to the Linux command line on the phone.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.560]   So if you type reboot--
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   Oops.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   --phone reboots.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.560]   Oops.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   I got it.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.600]   There's a Linux command line on the screen and you can tell it to me.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   No, it's not on the screen.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   That's the thing.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   It's going behind the screen.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.960]   Oh, you don't know.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   Everything you type goes to the command line.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.200]   So if you type a bash command, it'll execute it.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   Some of the things you do.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   I wonder if your friends are wrapped.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.800]   It probably does, but you can't see the output.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.760]   Well, somebody left this thing in debug mode when they released it.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.120]   Because that's the only explanation I can think of.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   That's just crazy.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   It's pretty funny.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   You can't turn it off.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.480]   It's also saving everything, you know, all your keystrokes.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.640]   It's saving them.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   That's interesting.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   It is.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.640]   That's not good.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640]   That's called key logging.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   Ooh.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   But to what avail of--
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.440]   Well, I guess if that's saving--
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   --all.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.440]   That's--
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.760]   So when did you get your phone?
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   I got it.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.120]   I ordered pre-ordered it.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.600]   So it came September 22, or whatever it was that all the phones came out.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.400]   And so it's the first generation.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.200]   So you've had it long enough to tell us what you think?
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   What do you think?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.560]   I thought you hated the battery.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.480]   The battery life is the killer.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.240]   It's got less than two or three hours if you just use it normally.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.480]   You just can't get past noon.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   That's not acceptable.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   You can't use it normally.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.520]   Well, in fact, what happened is I have it and I have an iPhone.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.280]   And I was going to give it a chance.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.760]   And I'm back to the iPhone.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.560]   But I'm going to keep the G1.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   Because I do think it'll get better.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   I expect a patch.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.080]   You know, the iPhone's battery life was pretty bad until a 2.2 came out.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.000]   Here, Martin, here's a fun game you can play.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.200]   You've got some Islanders, and you've got to keep them alive.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   Go ahead and enjoy that.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.040]   I mean, how much battery life now are you getting on the iPhone?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   iPhone's fine.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   It gets me through the day easily.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   Through the day.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   Easily.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   But any smartphone, I don't expect more than that.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   I'm going to charge it in my neighborhood.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Although my blackberry pearl, I know it's not the full phone anymore.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   It's like a week.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   I charge it probably once a week.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Wanna, what are you using for a phone?
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   Who?
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   I got an iPhone.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   I'm an iPhone junkie.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.760]   Yeah, but as far as the battery life is concerned, is the 3G and the push emails are killer.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.000]   I think all of the radio stuff that's going on is bad.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.560]   You know, you've got a GPS.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   This is the G1, too.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   You've got a GPS.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   You've got Bluetooth.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   You've got Wi-Fi.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.480]   You've got your Ev-Do or whatever, an HSDPA.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.200]   All of that's going at the same time.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.000]   But I also have a blackberry pearl, too, and I like that as well.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.440]   I have a curve that I'm...
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.640]   The G1 replaced the curve.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.000]   I would say it's comparable to the curve if it had battery life.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It just doesn't.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.960]   John, what do you use?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   I'm using a Nokia E72.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   I thought you only used burners.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   This is a company phone.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.640]   I like a company.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.880]   What company would that be?
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   Mi-vio.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   I just like him to say Mi-vio.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   Mi-vio.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.080]   I have to have a drink on that.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   Mi-vio.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   No, it's the devlog.org/blog/blog/v.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.880]   Why are you drinking a Mi-vio?
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.160]   No, wait a minute.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   If Devorik is going to...
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   I'm not crying.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   I've got a...
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   I've got a sick tick bite.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   Tick bite.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   Tick bite.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.800]   You haven't been on the show long enough, Steve.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.480]   You're not going to get a drinking name on the back bite.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.080]   You've got to work on your...
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   You've got to be well known before.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.720]   There's an actual drinking game around your appearance.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.920]   Can I wait till about 4.30?
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.880]   The sun will be over the yard.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   It's 5 o'clock somewhere.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   By the way, it's an E71 here.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   I'm looking at it.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.080]   I'm going to say the E71 is actually a great...
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.560]   It's a Nokia.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   It's got a keyboard.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.720]   It looks a lot like a BlackBerry.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.000]   I think it's probably one of the best smartphones.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I know Adam Curry loves it.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.200]   That's probably why it's the Mevio phone.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.600]   Well, I think we're the only two people that have that particular phone at the company.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   But it's a...
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.720]   A phone which only Curry and I have.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   Well, I mean, that's just...
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.920]   I mean, they have a bunch of options.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.360]   And most people use Blackberries and other phones for whatever reason.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.960]   I mean, Adam was jacked up about this phone.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   So I got one.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   And I have to say it's...
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.400]   What I like about it's just a really nice...
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.080]   It's kind of a sexy phone for an old-fashioned style with a big keyboard on it.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   I love it.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   I do.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   I think it's a great one.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   GPS that works.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.840]   Did it have turn-by-turn on it?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.720]   You have to subscribe to it.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   But they have it.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.320]   And then you'd also have like a white fly that works very well.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.440]   And it has a lot of features that are pretty cool.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   I was looking at something the other day.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.280]   And it just feels good in the hand.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.120]   Who does the Symbian fan?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.120]   I really am.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.200]   Who does the GPS on the phone that you've got?
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   John?
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.080]   I just did a piece of...
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.360]   My last article for PCWorld was on 3GPS as I tried it on 3 Blackberry Curves.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.520]   I tried a Sprint AT&T and Verizon.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   And the AT&T was spectacular.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.240]   Turn-by-turn, you know, driving along and you can just talk into it and say, "Listen,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.960]   I want to go to local Starbucks."
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   And it finds it.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   Wow.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   It's the route.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   Very, very cool.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   I would love that.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.440]   That's nice to be able to talk to your phone.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.640]   I can't have a smartphone.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.680]   I already have a crippling internet addiction.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.520]   I can't be allowed to bring out of the house with you.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.520]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   What can help you with your mic?
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   What's wrong with my mic?
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   It's kind of up to you here.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   It's like...
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   He has preternaturally small ears.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   No, I've never noticed that about you.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   Really?
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   Who's got small ears?
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.720]   Martin Sargent has preternaturally small ears.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Don't look.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Preternaturally.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   What are you doing with my ear?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   I have never been small ears for my entire life.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   Let me look it up.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   Preternaturally.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Preternaturally.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   That's some sort of cold word, Leo.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   It's got to be near you.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   They're nice.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   It's a cold word.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   Got a good lobe.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   Good hang.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   Okay.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   Okay.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   Get a room, kids.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   So...
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   There are lights on my lobe.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   There's a room upstairs in that place.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   You guys can use that.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.840]   With a c-off-foot tub.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.840]   So apparently, this is interesting.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   News we got a very...
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.440]   I thought a very good eight part series in this current issue.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.080]   It's also online.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.040]   Speaking the scenes of the campaign, one of the revelations was both McCain and Obama campaigns
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.600]   were hacked by far...
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.200]   They think this is Secret Service.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.320]   I always want to call them the SS.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.800]   The Secret Service thinks by foreign nationals, by foreign governments who were trying to figure
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.160]   out what the next president might be up to.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.080]   They think there was China, but I think that's too dead off because you know what's happening
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   now.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.920]   I mean, there was a couple of reports recently about how the...
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.640]   There's so many bootleg machines, bootleg Microsoft machines in China that all of them
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.000]   are rigged with some Russian software.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Unprotected.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.640]   And if you're a hacker, you don't use your machine.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.240]   You hack into other machines and you then hack whoever.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   Oh shit.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   That's what I was doing wrong.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   Steve, you hear that knock in the door?
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   Mr. Bass.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   All Mr. Bass.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   Sure.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.720]   Well, and now, and now revelations come out that the White House was also under attack
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.400]   from these same Chinese machines.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.080]   We'll say Chinese machines because we don't know who was behind the attack.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   But they do think it was...
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.080]   I mean, they said it was China.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   They don't know.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.920]   They said it was coming from China.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.760]   But they don't know IP addresses here.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.040]   They just got IPs, I think.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   So that's completely...
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.160]   In fact, it's almost certain that it didn't come from China.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   Although, I mean, I'm constantly...
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.040]   You know, I look at my server logs constantly attacked by Chinese people.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.160]   Yeah, but again, I don't think those are from China.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.720]   I think those are again are spoofed.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.600]   They're going through more than private times for other reasons.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.480]   But if you're actually the Chinese government doing this, they have enough smart guys in
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.160]   China to cover that whole thing up so it would come in as just a dry IP or something from
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   Sweden.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.080]   So if it looks like it's coming from China, then it's not coming from China.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.240]   Yeah, I would get it.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   That's what I would get.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   That's what I would get.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   That's so tricky.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   But now, it was behind it then.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.440]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   Here's the theory.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.640]   This is what the Secret Service says.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.800]   By the way, Patrick and I spoke to the Secret Service.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   They're intelligent.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.720]   They actually have good cyber crime people.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.760]   I presume that they know what we've just said.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.480]   But they say that they believe it's a foreign government because it was apparent from the
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   stuff they were downloading.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.560]   By the way, the Obama campaign, according to Newsweek, the Obama campaign thought it
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.200]   was a phishing exploit that somebody had opened or clicked a link and they thought it was just
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   a virus.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.560]   The Secret Service literally called them up, said it's much worse than you imagine.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.600]   They are downloading documents from you right now.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.640]   Apparently, just from what they downloaded, they're not trying to get--they didn't, by
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.120]   the way, ever get to the database of donors.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.240]   That might have been a credible place they were trying to get to for the credit card numbers.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.280]   What they did get, though, indicates to the Secret Service anyway that they were trying
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.520]   to figure out what the future president of the United States might do.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   This is a Russian.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.680]   This sounds more like the Russians did me than anyone.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   No, actually.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.480]   The rumor guy said it was Ron Paul.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.960]   So Paul is the skills.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.320]   The reason I say to the Russians is because if you watch, there's a Russian news show on
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.120]   in the Bay Area, you can get called Russia today.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.640]   If you've been watching that recently, they're doing a lot of weird stories about how things
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.920]   are going to change now that Obama's in and it's not going to be one guy calling all the
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   shots.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.440]   We're going to be negotiating more.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   It's kind of wacky, and so it's almost as though there's sending a message.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.360]   I don't know to who, but it's a weird show to watch nowadays.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.520]   You should check it out if anyone's interested in following him.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   It's a treat.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   I haven't watched it in weeks.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   Leo?
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   Leo, who did it?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   It was really interesting.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   Yes, Paul.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.760]   I know who did it.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   It was Decepticons, you know, because they went in and they took some stuff and we think
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.600]   it's the Chinese, we think it's the Russians.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   I saw the movie.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   It was the Decepticons.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.680]   All your base are being long to us.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.560]   It sounds just enough like Patrick Norton to be kind of to do some pranks.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.080]   Lana is our new Patrick Norton.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   Don't you think he sounds just a little bit like a bloody story?
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.960]   Lana, can you say folks, let's take a step back real quick?
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   Let's take a step back.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   That was good, exactly.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   He sounds exactly like him.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.760]   Do it again, do it again, again, Lana.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.880]   Folks, let's take a step back real.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   I win.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.000]   The ghost of Patrick Norton is with us.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.400]   I mean, are you sure that's not Patrick?
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   How do we really know that's not Patrick?
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.840]   And how do we know that Patrick didn't hack it?
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.400]   You're not in Florida.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.080]   Chinese servers or something going on.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.040]   What part of the country are you in?
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.680]   I'm in Jacksonville, Florida right now.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   Gators.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   Gators.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   See what I'm saying?
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.280]   Is it Patrick and Florida right now?
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.760]   Back to technology.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.440]   It's not who's packing in.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.960]   It's the fact that somebody's hacking.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.880]   It just scares the Dickens out of me that somebody has the skill to bypass secret service, to
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   bypass.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.800]   I think we need to put up.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.200]   I want to say a firewall.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   We need to take.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.680]   I just fumbled for words.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.280]   We need to stop it.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.560]   We just need to get these people off the internet.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.960]   It's not just Obama and McCain.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.800]   They hacked the White House.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.920]   Now the according to the secret service, but again, you know, are they going to admit
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   it?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.880]   If it went farther than this, they said, oh, they only got into relatively insecure public
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   systems.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.480]   They didn't get into the White House's secure files, but are they going to admit it if they
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   did?
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.280]   The fact that these are happening, it's one thing.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.840]   You know, like I said, I'm getting hacked or attacked all the time by Chinese IP addresses,
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.560]   but they are not getting in.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.760]   It's another thing entirely to say they got in.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.320]   Why are you a target of the Chinese?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.520]   Well, I've said a few things in the past that I'm not proud of.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520]   I said I'm in Chinese.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.880]   I don't know what they mean, but apparently they weren't good.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Oh, no.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.320]   That was my major in college.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:56.200]   No, no, I think frankly, if you look at the IP traffic, it's all coming out of China.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.120]   It's not Chinese people.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.880]   It's whoever is using these Chinese computers as their last stop before they attack you.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.200]   And the attacks are pretty primitive.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   They're just trying to brute force my SSH.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.760]   You imagine like a group of guys and Beijing being like, ready?
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   I would be honest.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   Let's do the ports.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.880]   I think they came out to one, two, a little bit more.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.600]   He's trying to hack me.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.680]   Marty, that could be, we could arrange that.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.240]   If you keep wearing that silly hat, you might get the Coast Guard after.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   But I think you're right, Steve.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   I mean, I think it's a look at this is going to be a large issue going forward.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.920]   Cyber warfare is a serious issue.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.840]   Now Obama says he's going to appoint a CTO for the United States.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   I love that.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.040]   I heard it was Steve Gibson.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.600]   It's regular startup.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.200]   Is this guy going to be walking around the White House wearing shorts?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   Yeah, and it's like Steve is with white socks on and stuff.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.400]   You know, a ponytail.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   Complained about how they didn't stock enough crackers.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.640]   So as we started slowly to generate into the morning zoo, what's the next story under this?
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   I don't like it.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.000]   It's a whole new look for tour.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Devorik, that wasn't you at Farley's the other day, was it?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.200]   No, it wasn't at Farley's.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.000]   Do you find it at the White local?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   You got to also get here walking around San Francisco.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Yeah, I've heard about it.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.600]   Devorik look like Roman around.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   But it's not me.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   It's not me.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   It's not me.

[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.600]   It's not me.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   You actually don't need a computer.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   It's just it all for you.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   It has copy paste, too.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   John and I used to talk about this a lot, actually, because you like those buckling
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   key switches, right?
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   Buckling key.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   I like that.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.920]   You know, the all-time greatest keyboard ever made was the one that came with the IBM
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   PCAT.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.880]   It was a big giant heavy thing.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   The thing weighed about 40 pounds.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.160]   It was extremely well built.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   I mean, of course, you could hurt yourself with it if you dropped it on your foot, but
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.840]   it had really good feel and it had the right spacing and it had the keys in the right
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   places.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.080]   It was very, very effective.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   I like that keyboard a lot.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.160]   And I think the old timers will all remember it.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   Many people will remember that because, of course, that's IBM patent 4,118,601.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]   Wow.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   You got the IBM buckling.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   You got the little point angel.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   And buckling spring.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.640]   John, a bunch of people in the chat room are asking if you had anything to do.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.240]   You must get to sell the time with the Devorak keyboard.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.720]   Of course not.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.480]   Devor keyboard was invented over a decade or more before I was even born.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.360]   It was invented in the '30s.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.680]   But he did write the ninth symphony.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.360]   I did this symphony.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.600]   They're confused.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.200]   They're easily confused or they wouldn't be in a chat room.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200]   No, I always...
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   Hold on.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.200]   Yeah, come on.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200]   Come on.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.760]   I always thought Twitch stood for this week.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.440]   You get tech clearly is this week in typing.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.240]   I didn't know.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   Devorak.org/blog.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   Oh, thank you, John.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   Good truth.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   Oh.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   All right.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.720]   And one other keyboard.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.880]   And John, I have a question.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.320]   Do you have the control key where it really belongs?
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.240]   Or do you have it with the wrong keyboards?
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.680]   Have the control key where the caps lock key is?
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   Right.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   I have it.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.760]   I unfortunately gave up on the good fight.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.440]   And I still have a caps lock key there.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.360]   I wrote an entire column for PC computing one year, which got some negative response from
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   the editors.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.280]   But the readers, like it was all about why the caps lock key should be discarded.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.040]   Why do we have that keyword where it's located?
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   We don't beat it.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   It makes no sense.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.240]   But that's the nice thing about this avant-stele keyboard.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   You can disable it.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.840]   You remap the entire keyboard.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   And wait a minute.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.120]   Do you remember Gateway had the Maxi Switch keyboard?
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   And wait a minute.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   There's more.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   Yes, right.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   Do you remember the Maxi key Switchboard?
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   I remember that.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   I remember it.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.160]   I don't remember anything about it.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.360]   Totally pre-programmable.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.600]   The entire keyboard.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Right.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Well.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.240]   There's software to do that with any keyboard though nowadays.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:13.080]   Yeah, but with Vista, the best keyboard remapping was Key Tweak.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.440]   And it doesn't work with Vista.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   A lot of things don't work with Vista.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   Yeah, it sounds like the old timers league.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   It really does.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440]   Yeah, just.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   As a kid, we use the Key Tronic.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:31.000]   We had a green screen and then we kicked it when it didn't work.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.320]   And that's why I'm still getting six and a half bucks an hour.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   You know, it's.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   So, yeah.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.120]   Yeah, it's like asking about the fries anyway.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.920]   President-elect Obama is expected to name Washington DC lawyer Henry Rivera to head a
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.800]   transition team focused on the FCC.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.520]   He's going to have a lot of influence on what happens at the FCC.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:07:02.040]   Rivera, it used to be a partner in Wiley Rine served at the FCC under Mark Fowler 81-85.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.520]   Current FCC chairman Kevin Martin worked at Wiley Rine.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.280]   This guy is a quintessential insider.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.800]   You know, everyone's blaming Obama.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.640]   I'm not an Obama fan by the way, but everyone's blaming it for all you know, he's putting
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.840]   it, he says, change, change new, this, that, and the other thing and he brings in all these
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.240]   kind of old hacks.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.720]   I think it's probably what he should do.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.120]   I mean, he can get rid of the old hacks after he gets his feet wet, but he can't go in there
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.440]   like a rub because he'll just walk all over him.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.760]   And this, yeah, it's a transition team.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.960]   I mean, these are the guys who know where the bodies are buried.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.880]   That's I guess the guy you want in there.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.120]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.520]   I mean, Carter is one of the guys who walked in and got, you know, sub-marineed and then
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.680]   Clinton apparently walked in naively and it took a couple years to get.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680]   Terrible transition.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:47.480]   Yeah, but the differences Obama's doing the transition team two or three days after he
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   was elected.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   I mean, the guy is sharp.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.160]   He's doing, you know, it's interesting.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.480]   I mean, I think it's not two or three days after he's elected.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.280]   It looks like more we learn that he's been doing this for months.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   He's been preparing a transition.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.680]   Yeah, he's going on a long time.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.400]   I'm looking forward to HBO is going to do a documentary.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.720]   They've been following him for two and a half years and I can't wait to see it come out.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.640]   One of the great documentaries on elections was the War Room, the Clinton election.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   Right.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   James Carville and just fascinating.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.280]   What movie was that?
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280]   What movie was that?
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280]   The War Room?
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.760]   The movie that had, I'm just going to read that crazy book that came out that had all
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   the scandalous information.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   Joe Klein's book.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   And apparently, you know, they kind of indicated that Carville was a flasher.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.240]   You know, he looks like he could be, but we wouldn't want to libel the man.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.000]   So I'm not sure that guy indicated in the book.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.240]   He should sue the book.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   Absolutely not.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.680]   Well, John, you know, you can sue anybody.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.920]   I don't think that's the kind of lawsuit you want to get involved with.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.640]   I'm an LLC and I've got all of my assets sheltered in the Netherlands.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.600]   So don't, you know, Netherlands.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   Probably not.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   Nether regions.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   Did I say Netherlands?
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   Now you gave it away.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.600]   Oh boy.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   Primary colors.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   That's the name of the book.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.240]   I wish it was a thinly, thinly veiled Roman's.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   I laugh.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.240]   It was hilarious.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240]   It was.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.200]   And I think a lot of it was not intended to be.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   He wrote it anonymously.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.200]   I think he'd eat.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.200]   He was.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   He was fiction.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.200]   It was fiction.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.200]   I was fiction.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.600]   Anybody have any other stories they want to cover?
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.520]   Any other big breaking news in the tech community?
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.320]   I got a quick story.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.600]   I have that poor kid who.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.720]   Well, do you want to tell that story?
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.640]   That is the saddest story I've ever heard.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.840]   Well, you know, I mean.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.760]   Well, let's tell it now that you've broached the subject.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.440]   You might as well finish it.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   Have some more cheese.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   Well, he was.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   Thank you.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   It's very good.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   Nobody else wants it.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   Thank you.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   I'm going to eat this whole bag up by myself.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   Microsoft put in $25,000 reward for his, you know, people got very galvanized by this
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   and to have this tragic end to it.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   It's just...
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.440]   It's also really sad as you read the message board postings at the end of that article,
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.440]   the forums.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   People creepy here.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440]   Unbelievable.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   It's a shame to you.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   But it's a bunch of 15 year olds.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   You know that.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440]   Well, I don't care if you're 15.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440]   Well, you know it's hard to get used to it.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   You have to get used to it.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   They are missing.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440]   Not all of them.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440]   Some of them.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440]   A little bit of screw.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   And by the way, you know, this is one of the reasons, you know, I remember when I first
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.440]   started blogging and we were really harsh with our moderating.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   If you, "Oh, you're moderating.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   You erased my thing."
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   You know, moderating is extremely important.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   You know those creepy posts that you see can easily be removed if people moderate more
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.440]   aggressively and you don't have to deal with.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440]   I don't think readers should be an encounter.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.440]   I mean, you're going to have a bunch of crackpots on any system.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.440]   But when it gets really nasty or creepy, it's got to go.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   It's a tough decision.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440]   You know, I've had to recently do some...
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440]   It's not that tough.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440]   I'm moderating it.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]   But you're right.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.440]   You can get a chilling effect from some of these people and you really do need to make
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   it safe for normal people.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440]   For everybody else.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   The problem is that on the internet, you can be totally anonymous.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.440]   And I think there are a lot of them are kids.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.440]   I think that's part of the problem.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.440]   But I think also the anonymity allows people to do and say things that they wouldn't say
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   in real life.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   I always say, pretend you're sitting next to me.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Pretend you're actually here.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   Now would you say that?
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Exactly.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.040]   So many years to finally moderate comments on just my personal blog.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   I don't know why I never did before.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   Do you do with a heavy hand?
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.440]   Do you have any of your out there doing it every day now?
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   I think you have to.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   If you're a woman in tech especially, you're absolutely...
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   But I'm really not going to delete something unless it's really bad.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   You know, it's almost like if I think it's going to offend everybody else, then I really,
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   you know, if it's something that I don't like what you're wearing or anything, I can deal
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   with that.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.440]   You ever go after people, like, direct, like you find out who this person is.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.440]   Like you find out how they're talking to their home.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   They're going to shut them down.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.440]   I used to get your blog right in the knees and try to figure out things.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440]   They don't think that you're going to read that thing.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   Let alone respond.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440]   Oh no, if you respond, it's like, oh my God.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   Oh my God, you're not even worried.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   Talk to me.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.440]   As soon as people know you're moderating them, there's only a few nasty things I get now.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   I mean, it used to be a lot worse.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.440]   But now they know that I'll read it and it won't be people.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   Yeah, and then, you know, there's also the guys who would like to come in with different
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   names and stuff.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   But, you know, if you run...
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   This one I had talked about blogging with some event recently.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.440]   So, you know, real blogging isn't these guys at the newspapers that have the stuff go through
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   editors.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.440]   When you run and own your blog, you go back there.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.160]   You can see what the IP addresses are.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.440]   You can ban the IP address so the guy can't even get on the blog anymore.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   I mean, if you really had some fancy systems, you could have one of those things.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   I think it's called a clown filter.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440]   You know what those are?
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440]   Bosel.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440]   Bosel filter.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440]   Those are the right.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.440]   So, the people who just typed in one letter.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.440]   Oh, clowns here.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   Clown filter, yeah.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   Getting old.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.240]   I think it's the moral responsibility of someone running a blog to take care of all of the comments.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.240]   I think so too.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   And you just do it.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.400]   You got it because there are people saying inappropriate things whether you're offended
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.240]   or not, they're inappropriate and they just cut them off.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.120]   There's a lot of filtering mechanisms that actually can cut them off without you even
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.120]   doing anything which is useful.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.360]   I am a fan of IRC.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.720]   I'm a big fan of IRC because it has great moderation tools.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.800]   If like 10 people come in and start just causing trouble in my chat room or anything, I just
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.880]   moderate the chat and just have voice users talk or I can just ban the problematic users.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:01.360]   You know, that's why like IRC, I think it's a big, the tools you use is a big component
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.640]   as to how effective you can moderate.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.720]   We have, let me see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten moderators
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.720]   in our IRC.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.200]   We have, you know, when you have that many people going, you have, we have a big, we
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.800]   wield a big ban stick.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.240]   Let me tell you.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   And it works.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   It does work.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   It does.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240]   Yeah, they start, they, they want it.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.880]   What's this I'm hearing in the chat room about you just having won an award?
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   I don't know.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.480]   Who, what, what is this chat room?
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   The best hat.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   Not you Leo.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480]   Twid, I think.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   You won.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.960]   Twid won a podcast award.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   We win those every year.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.680]   Well, what do we win?
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.080]   Round of applause.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   Geez.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   A shiny, shiny.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.240]   I'd love to win a podcast award.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.840]   A key fob.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.040]   See, see, see all the awards in the, in the shelf.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.800]   They just do an award on TV.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800]   No, I'm very grateful.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   I appreciate it.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   Who's we?
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   What we used to do.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.800]   All the way through the show.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.120]   All the way through the show is, you know, I, I do have to say that there are so many
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.560]   award shows, web award shows that they all kind of sound the same to me after a while.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   I know that they're on the board.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   This is the big one.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.320]   This is the podcast awards that they do at the NIMEDI expo, I think, right?
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   This is the, this is the podcast awards.com.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.320]   Then you're happy about it.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.320]   What did we win?
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   I didn't, well, yeah, thrilled about it.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   I didn't even know we won.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   They were announced today at 4PM.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.320]   Good beat.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   Do you want to best, now, you know, just the second.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   Best tech.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   Oh, that's great.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   Just one.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   Best tech.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   Well, that's great.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   This isn't, this is a great honor.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   And I want to thank the Academy for making me once again, the best tech podcast in the
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   world.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.600]   Do you have a, do you have a Chuck Sito in the closet?
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.280]   I don't think they heard this particular episode is my only fear.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.200]   Hey, I got a tech question for you.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.400]   How many of you saw the hologram on CNN?
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   Oh, I saw both of them.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   They're terrible.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   Very, very cool.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400]   All right.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   All right.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.320]   Steve Bass, you start.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.960]   Very cool wine.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   It was cool.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.840]   It was, it was absolutely valueless.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.720]   I couldn't give a hoot that they were standing, you know, in front of each other.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.080]   They could have done the same thing under 10 behind a green screen.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.800]   But the technology to be able to see that and to hear that they used what?
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.040]   48 different, you know, there was some disagreement.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.400]   The car response at 32.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400]   I read 44.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   I mean, it was.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   I read 30.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.880]   You know who was apparently behind those two mini Jason Odell and David Borman.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.640]   We've Jason Odell and David Borman.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   Okay.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.840]   Well, let me, you good for, he was great guy and Borman started the site.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.040]   He got the site launched.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.280]   So maybe we should ask Borman the question that I still haven't found an answer to.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.560]   Maybe one of you guys know, which is did the person that Wolf bullets or whoever the
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.880]   heck it was looking at will I am or the other person that came on, did they actually see
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.200]   something at the stage?
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.440]   They were doing exactly what Soledad O'Brien was doing in 1996 when I appeared as a 3D
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.120]   graphic on the site on MSNBC.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:58.120]   She was looking at a blue dot and I'm guarantee you, what this is looking at a blue dot.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.600]   He's not seeing a hologram.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.880]   Well, then what good is it?
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.880]   What's the point?
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.440]   It wasn't the Star Trek show.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440]   No.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.000]   To me, it was a little gimmicky and frankly, look, you guys work in TV.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   It's not.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.720]   They don't need 30 cameras to not anymore.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   Well, it was way too.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720]   You know what it was.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   It wasn't on me.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720]   Give me a week.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.640]   You know, this person looks like they've been, you know, they've been hologram.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.440]   Well, they intentionally did that.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.440]   They had to make it look less lower quality.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   They had to dumb it down.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440]   It was too many.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440]   It looked too real.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.320]   You know, like the woman, her name is escaping me.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.800]   You know, she had to stand real still and she's kind of awkward looking.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   I mean, the whole thing just seemed unnecessary.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.600]   I was hoping to have the election coverage for current that night.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600]   Were you?
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   I was.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600]   No, I didn't know that.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.600]   I was.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.600]   For Al Gore's channel.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.600]   Al Gore's current.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.360]   Yeah, it was the whole Twitter.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.240]   It was Twitter slash current.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   I didn't know you were.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   I was.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240]   That thing's still on the air.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.240]   Apparently because they paid me.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]   Oh, I wish I could have.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.760]   We did the same thing here.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.880]   I didn't know we could have.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   We could have.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   I actually like current.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.440]   Hey, don't you think it would have been cooler if they would have instead of dumbing
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.600]   it down, made it ultra high resolution, put the person on the stage, had the interaction
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.240]   and then not said anything and let it leak out that it was actually a hologram and the
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.880]   person wasn't there as part of their new technology.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.080]   I would have enjoyed that.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.880]   I would have enjoyed it a lot more than telling us.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   Right.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   That would have been terrific.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   The name of the game.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.640]   I think it was cool to watch.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:26.320]   I mean, I got I got a Star Wars goose pimple and then it went away and I was like, okay,
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   that was cool.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.520]   And then I read about how it was done.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.240]   I was like, all right, that's just that's just ridiculous.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:36.080]   That's a giant way to have everybody like lean over and do the thing and then stand up
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.080]   and deliver their.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.160]   I think I can do something like that here.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.160]   You are.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.160]   There's the back of my head and there's the front of my.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160]   We are.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.240]   I like you, but that's the worst hologram I've ever seen.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.160]   It's like us doing again, doing again, doing again, doing again.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.160]   It's like a four man starwife.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160]   It's not a.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   I'm doing.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.920]   A starwife with a video toaster.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.520]   I think it's time to cut them all off.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520]   No more.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   No more wine.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520]   I have a small.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   I got a slash blog.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520]   A small.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520]   Good dream.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520]   No, that's mean.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.640]   So, okay, so you thought Steve Bass, it was a good thing.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   I loved it.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   I thought it was terrific, but I'm not a TV guy.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.040]   So John C thought it was gimmicky.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040]   Exactly.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.040]   Why not?
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   What do you think?
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.600]   I thought it was all right.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.880]   It was like I said, it was, it was one of those things where it was cool to look at because
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   I love Star Wars.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.800]   I thought I was looking at Princess Leia for a half a microsecond and then it wore off
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.640]   and I quickly got over it real, real fast.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.320]   Now the time they got the will I am, it was just, it was at that point I was tired of
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.160]   it because it looked too fake and I think they should have just bumped up the quality
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.000]   like they were originally attended to.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   It just was odd.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.400]   I can't understand who the audience was for this.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.400]   Who are they?
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:03.600]   Are they trying to impress people with their technological savvy or is it some, I mean,
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.960]   did they enhance in any way the information?
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960]   No.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.240]   They were doing a one upmanship to MSNBC and Fox.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.240]   Exactly.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240]   That's what I was going to say.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.920]   MSNBC had their silly ice rink.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.160]   That was the worst.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.640]   That was the worst.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   What was that?
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   It was horrible.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   It was a three-year-old.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.120]   It was just bizarre.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.360]   They had columns.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.520]   Things came up and down.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.280]   It was a cheap look and set look like it was done with some old gear like an old low caster.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.280]   It was horrible.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.280]   It was pretty cheesy.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   I mean, I could do that.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.280]   Look, I got money.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.280]   Did you do some more of those fix?
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.440]   Yeah, I got money coming out of my ear.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.680]   That's like a magic trick.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.320]   It only took two cameras.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.320]   Oh my God.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.240]   Yeah, I got balloons.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   I can do that.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   I'm eating my microphone out of that.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:52.240]   I don't need 44 cameras on Sarah Lane to make her appear fuzzy and low quality.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.920]   I can do that with this switch right here.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.680]   Or just, you know, squint.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680]   Squint.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.680]   That's a squint.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   All right.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.440]   Jessica Yellen is the name of the course.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.440]   Jessica Yellen.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.440]   Oh, Yellen.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   Jessica.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.280]   I mean, I think it's cool if you're going to do it with Will I Am, do it with a guest.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.280]   That's fun.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.120]   But when you know that it took 38 cameras and they had a special set and they had to
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.680]   be specially lit.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.880]   And what is, and to do what?
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.160]   To do anything any better than a double box?
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.360]   I mean, is that really any better?
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   But you know, everybody tuned in to take a look.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   So there you go.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   I just caught up by accident.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.960]   I wasn't tuning in to take a look.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.040]   What kind of people were though?
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   I can do that.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.960]   I'll put Sarah in the double box.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   Let's see here.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   I'll see.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   I'm eating.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.080]   We can do everything they did.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.680]   Look, now Sarah's appearing live in our studio.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   It's amazing.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.680]   I love you.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   I love you.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.280]   The difference is she's actually there.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280]   There's a thought.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.680]   Well, wait a minute, John.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   You're trying.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.680]   Wait a minute, John.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.080]   I'm sitting in my underwear in my apartment in San Francisco.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.680]   There was a show once on TV called Silicon Spin in which you would have.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680]   This is unbelievable.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.840]   It's funny you're going to bring it up.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.040]   So a lot of times you'd have a guest via satellite.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.640]   So this was the creation of these guys who had to change the show.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.360]   We had a pretty decent little show that people liked.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   And new, new, new.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:23.080]   We got to make it more like the show that was Larry's favorite show, which was Hardball.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.520]   So no, it should be more like Hardball.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.240]   And of course, the thing was, Hardball was on the same time as my show.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.720]   So he never watched our show.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.840]   He was always watching Hardball.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.440]   Apparently, he told somebody, Peter Hammersley, ended up bringing this idea in.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.840]   No, we got to make it look like there's like a satellite and you're talking to somebody
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   or somewhere.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   So we'd have this guy.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.680]   And these guys thought we were idiots, by the way.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   All of our guests.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.480]   I mean, I would come into a place and think I was, you were idiots if you did this.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.920]   This is the same studio.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.920]   He sat the guy across the room, putting a separate camera on him.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.840]   Boxed him in as though he was coming in from Cleveland when he's sitting right there.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.840]   He's the same room.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.840]   Why doesn't he just come over?
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.840]   He's the same room.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   He's in the chair.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.840]   Exactly.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.840]   Wow.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   It's technology.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.120]   Was that a crock or what?
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.760]   I'll never forget walking into the studio and I did a double take.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.360]   I'm looking at you on the set.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   I'm looking at the screen.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.600]   There's a guy in a box and then I'm looking over here.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.040]   He's sitting and not only that, did they prop him up?
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.160]   Did they like put, did they raise the chair?
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.680]   Was he like on a platform?
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.400]   He was on a tall chair.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.920]   I don't know what the point of that was.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.920]   It's very strange.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.120]   It was a very strange thing.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   It was crazy.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.360]   We could do that too.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:37.480]   Coming in now live from his basement apartment in Rochester, New York, Martin Sargent is joining
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.720]   us on the show and it's great to see you, Martin.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.600]   Give us a little tour of the facility that you're in there.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600]   Make sure there's a delay.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.480]   Well, this is my library of computer books.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480]   Right.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.800]   You know me always reading tech books.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   Very nice.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   Uh oh.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   Happy birthday.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   Happy birthday, gosh.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   All right.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   All right.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   Wow.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.480]   We're just going to end this here because it's just gone on.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.280]   I think we have loaded far too long.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.280]   I'm a little late.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.640]   I ate half a large baguette of French bread.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   You look fabulous.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   You're in the show.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.640]   Somebody.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   Well, I feel a little, you know.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   You know, half a half a large.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.160]   Hey, I got Sargeworld.com backup.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.160]   Did you?
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.160]   All right.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.600]   I finally have the time to blog again.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600]   Did my first post.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:30.880]   You go to Sargeworld.com and get my reaction about the whole revision three cancellation
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   of internet.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.040]   You know, to me, the best thing is Sargeworld.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:38.280]   That picture of you at the bar, which is the header picture of that, that is one of
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.280]   my favorite.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.280]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.280]   And who is this guy?
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.280]   He was just some guy.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.280]   He and my ex go from what we used to do.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.520]   She had one of those GPS things.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.960]   We would just drive around and put in bars and we would just go from bar to bar in towns
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960]   that we didn't know.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   And that's like what was one of our bodies.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   It's a great looking bar.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   It's got a lot of neon.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.000]   It's somewhere in Southern California.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.520]   If you zoom back out there, Leo, I'm going to announce something that no one has ever
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.680]   in the two years of study has been up.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.080]   No one has ever pointed out the toilet.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.440]   There's a toilet in the right hand.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.440]   I never noticed it.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440]   I never noticed it.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.440]   No one's ever pointed out.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.280]   What's this website?
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   Sargeworld.com.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   Sargeworld.com.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   S-A-R-G-E.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.280]   It's short for a sergeant.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.640]   Yeah, I know I got that Sargeworld.com.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.840]   I get service on available.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   Oh, because now.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.040]   Oh, it's probably got sounded by everybody.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.480]   You just recently found out.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.120]   We brought it down.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   You guys brought it down.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   He's got go daddy issues.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.120]   Yes.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   And the funny thing is it read.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   Exactly.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   It's 50 or 65 people.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   No, no, it's not that.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.080]   But we just set 5,000 people there at the same time.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.080]   No.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   You want to bring on devorect.org/blog?
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   Go ahead.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   We can do that.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.080]   devorect.org/blog.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.080]   Save.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080]   We can bring it down.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.080]   Everybody go there right now.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.080]   devorect.org/blog.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.080]   Not only.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.160]   Not only are we going to bring it down now, but we'll bring it down again four hours from
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.320]   now and again in about eight hours and about 12 hours.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   I came up.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   It came up.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.560]   Yeah, he's running the cache.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.760]   It's a problem I have with go daddy.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   I need to switch.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.160]   You don't have a dedicated server.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   That's all right.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   You know, it's easy to bring.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160]   We bring servers down all the time on this show.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160]   We are.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.320]   We're going to bring them on live.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:15.040]   If you're going to go ahead and Steve, it's techbiketec.com.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.840]   Let's see if we bring that down.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.160]   You guys got to move faster if you're going to bring these things down.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.520]   I think the cache.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520]   Cash with army.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.520]   Cash save you.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   And then of course, Sarah Lane, S-A-R-A-H-L-A-N-E.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.520]   Sarah Lane.com.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   I'm actually going to be launching a new blog.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.200]   Look, I'm moving over to Squarespace this week.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.200]   What's Squarespace?
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   I don't know that.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.200]   Squarespace is amazing.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.200]   You're going to love it.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200]   It's a blog hosting.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.200]   It's not a mobile type.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.200]   It's not a mobile type.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   It's not a type pass.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.200]   It's not WordPress.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.680]   It's actually a different service.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.680]   You could be eating here too, John.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.680]   Next time you come.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.680]   I've been working on my iPad for five years.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.600]   You haven't blogged for two days.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.200]   She blocked two's Thursday.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.440]   So it's starting in blood for 16 months.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.240]   See, that was busy.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.000]   Yeah, but his blood blew up.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.560]   We didn't get to see that.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.560]   Wanna.org.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   I'm very excited.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   I've been working on my new design.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.560]   I'm not going to work out.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.440]   I'm going to unveil a whole new blog too.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.800]   I'm actually hiring a designer.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.080]   And Wanna, I like that picture of you pointing to the "I voted" button on your chest.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.640]   I think I got a crap out of it.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.000]   I want a "that sticker" and they gave me the red sticker.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   I put my laptop.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.360]   Yeah, I just spelled that one.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   B-W-A-N-A.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   Isn't that Bwanna?
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.280]   I've been meaning to ask you.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.840]   Isn't that what in Tarzan movies with the names called Tarzan was Bwanna?
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   Yep.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.880]   It was commonly used for authority figures.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.840]   It's used in Africa as a title of courtesy like "Mr. or Sir."
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.000]   So in the Tarzan movies, they always refer to the Safari Hunters as Bwanna.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.680]   And you just chose that name or is it a family calling you that or?
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.240]   Well, my mom chose it and she liked it.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.240]   And then she did that.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240]   That's your given name?
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.680]   That's my given name, yeah.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   Wow.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.040]   I thought it was a never-name name.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.680]   It was a never-name-given-name dude.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.040]   I wanted to name my son Buck or Lucky figuring that either one would be Lucky.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.440]   Buck or Lucky.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.040]   But my wife said no.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.240]   I wanted to name my daughter Reed, R-E-E-D.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.240]   So her name would be Reed de Vorak.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   I thought it was my flock.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.240]   I'm going to have a drink on that one.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.240]   I don't know.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.040]   And what did you say to that?
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.240]   The chat room is saying, "Dorak's site is down."
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.240]   We brought them all down actually.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240]   Yeah, mine's down.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240]   All right.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240]   Good work, boys.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.240]   Why is that?
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240]   Good job.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.240]   Mine's up.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240]   They're all good.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.240]   We got good people in that chat room.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240]   We know how to bring a site down.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240]   Oh, man.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   Supercast.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.640]   You got to try mine.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   All right.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640]   TechBite.com.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   There's nothing to bring down.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.040]   It's got like three words on it.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040]   That's right.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.640]   It came up for me.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.440]   Well, maybe you guys can take down Twitter by following me at Twitter.com/MartinSergeant.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.840]   She's Martin.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.640]   What about the reel before I think?
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640]   That's it.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.640]   Now we go into the...
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is just a plug part of the show you can stop listening.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.840]   Yeah, you may stop.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.240]   Pause your iPods now.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.240]   There's Martin Serrant.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.640]   By the way, Leo, you don't even follow me.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640]   I don't follow you.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640]   No, you do not follow me.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.640]   I'm not following you.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.640]   I'm so sorry.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   I believe you follow me.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   I follow Sarah.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   No, no.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:25.640]   And is that a little pony on your side?
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.120]   Before I left you, my girlfriend said, "Make sure you tell that Leo to follow you."
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.440]   I can't believe I don't follow you.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   That's a mistake.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440]   Oh.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.640]   Especially any site with a pony on it.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   Isn't there a cute pony?
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   A rendiced magic.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   Didn't used to be a pony.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   What was it last time?
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640]   It was me and a bathtub.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640]   It severed.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.120]   With Joey the Intern as a bird ripping my end.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.360]   Is Joey had a work now too?
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.120]   No, he works with Paul Block.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.120]   How about LA?
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.120]   God.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.960]   My deepest sympathies.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   Ooh.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   Sarah Lane.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.960]   Some conservative.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   The real.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.200]   It's one of those, you know.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200]   Devorak.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.360]   That's a good picture of you.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360]   I love that.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360]   You got a...
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   It looks like a 40 in there.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360]   It's not a 40.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.560]   I'm hugging a Sierra Nevada, my favorite viewer.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   Sierra Nevada.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   There's the real Devorak.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.760]   What is that, Avatar for you, John there?
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.520]   It's a roller coaster.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.720]   That is the Mountain Dues.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.720]   Oh.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.520]   That is the Appalachian State Mountaineers.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.080]   Oh, the Mountaineers.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.240]   Did you ever get that sweatshirt?
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.240]   You were looking?
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.240]   I got a bunch of sweatshirts.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240]   I got the three-peat sweatshirt.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   I got a whole bunch of hoodies.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.400]   I'm hoping they're going to win four in a row.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.400]   Then I'll get another.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   I'm going to be big for another one.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   Is that where you went to school?
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.840]   No, I went to Berkeley.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.520]   But I have to root for a winner someplace.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   I hope you went to Berkeley.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.840]   Is it honorary, Mountaineer?
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.840]   We have to be.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.120]   Otherwise, we're never going to see a championship.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:48.680]   So is there any shirt, anything we can get you on this episode, John?
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680]   Not yet.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.920]   But let me think about it.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.920]   We'll wait.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.400]   I also have to talk to you about something later.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.400]   We will.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400]   Steve Bass, are you on Twitter?
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.400]   Uh-uh.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.800]   I was just taking a sip of wine.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.640]   What did you say?
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.640]   Are you on Twitter?
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.640]   You are on Twitter.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.480]   You've got no followers.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   You're following three people.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.480]   That's good.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:15.280]   It's Bill McCrone and me are the last two people who are on Twitter in the universe.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.640]   You know, you do know that you need to post something on there, right?
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.000]   Yeah, but take a look at what I signed up.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]   It was two days ago.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Oh, there you go.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.080]   And let me look at-- Oh, McCrone is not-- does not exist.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.080]   That's what he said.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.760]   Wanna is-- you know, the best thing about Wanna-- and I think every parent should consider
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:34.280]   this when naming a child-- is you're the only Wanna.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.280]   Yep.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.600]   You can almost worry about that name game.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.480]   You can always get your first name on Twitter or friend feeder anywhere.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.280]   Next time I see Patrick on a call, I'm Wanna Norton and just confuse the hell out of him.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.840]   Wanna is-- Hey, Wanna.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.920]   Wanna is Patrick Norton, a real car name.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920]   I like the name Wanna.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.920]   I love the name Wanna.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920]   I love the name Wanna.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.240]   I just thought it was a nickname.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   It's a nice name.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   That's wonderful.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.240]   I think it's great.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   I love it too, Leo.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   Aww.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.240]   There you go.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240]   Oh, hey, we're really glad to have you on--
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.120]   I'm not fond of it.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.480]   Take another drink, you'll get a drink from him.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.440]   Yeah, you just need a drink more.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.920]   You'll learn to like it.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.680]   So we ended the show, I mean, I think at 405 and we're up to 438, which is Chit Chat.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.280]   Yeah, now we like to have a lot of Chit Chat because then we can use it to blackmail you
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.280]   later.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280]   Awesome.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.880]   Anything you want to say illegal, immoral or fattening?
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.880]   Twitter.com/Banna.
