[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I want to thank Becky Worley for filling in for me last week.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And the week before was it Jason or Father Robert, right?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Father Robert Ballis there for filling in. I'm back.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And I have assembled a fabulous panel for my return starting with Ms. Ashley Asketha.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Great to have you.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Hi friends.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And as I learned from your Instagram feed, a former professional gamer.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah, my former life.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So I got to know more about that. What is like you made money doing that?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I wouldn't say I made money.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So I got signed to the Global Gaming League before it was I think what it is now or what it became now.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It was the very first iteration of GGL.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I got signed for a one year contract to play Unreal Tournament.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I know that they were kind of looking for women gamers.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And it was me and another girl whose handle I think was Wabi Sabi.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm pretty sure that's okay.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oh, I remember. She was great.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah, she's great.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I love Wabi Sabi.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   That stint in Global Gaming League led to my very first job in games journalism
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   because I was interviewed as a pro gamer for Play Magazine.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   There you go.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And they liked my answer so much that I was offered a job.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So they were like, do you want to just be an associate editor?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I was like, yes, that sounds like the best thing ever.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So that's how I started in games journalism, which is pretty cool.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Let me, I'm just going to pull up the picture of you that you posted on Instagram.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   If I get to it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Leo, you're obsessed with this picture.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I love it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Well, you're kind of cute.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   This is what you said 19 years ago.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But the thing that I'm really obsessed with is the opening act for Jane's addiction.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It was really weird.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It was like it was a tournament that happened right next to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And it was some sort of weekend festival.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And so they put on this exhibition match where a whole bunch of us were on stage.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There was like, I think eight of us on stage.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And we all played a couple of rounds of a death match for Unreal Tournament.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And so everybody's out there waiting for Jane's addiction to come on.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And here comes these losers like playing Unreal Tournament.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You don't ever want to be the opening act for any big band.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   No.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   They didn't boo you though.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   No, everybody was very supportive.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I will say I have to give credit to the people of Cleveland for not completely booing us off the stage.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I appreciate you.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Did you, I mean you have to come out and go, hello, Cleveland when you come out, right?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Hello, Cleveland.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Good night.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Good night, Cleveland.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Good night, Cleveland.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And Pro, it's also here.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's great to see you once again, Ant.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Thank you for following my Instagram feed as I wandered Japan.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   You're the only person who liked anything I did, but I appreciate it.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That just makes it sound like I'm a stalker.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Yeah, he stalked me.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   He basically stalked me all the way through Japan.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   No, I really appreciate it because it's a great photographer and I really appreciated your feedback.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I noticed though you didn't say anything about this picture I brought back.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   This is literally a product in Japan, the Sharp EL 428, right about the same time.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Ashley is playing video games for a living.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   This came out.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's an abacus and a calculator.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   That's awesome.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Incredible.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I saw this at the Tokyo Edo Museum, the City Museum.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's real.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Isn't that wild?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That thing is awesome.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   That's way better than my TI 1795 that I used to have.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Oh man.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   They said they had weird stuff in Japan, but this proved it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Also with us is great to have you, Micah Sargent, senior editor of Mobile Nations.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's great to have you once again, Micah filled in for me on iOS today.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then you filled in before that for Megan Moroni on iOS today.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Yeah, good times, good times.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Nice to have you.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You're welcome.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Happy to be here.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.560]   Anything happen while I was gone?
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.200]   Literally, I was not following the news at all.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.280]   I saw some dim things about Elon Musk insulting an analyst on a conference call.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   I saw Apple.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.080]   I was actually watching with interest because I have to say I'm going to stop following
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.360]   the financial news because there was for the last two or three weeks, people have been
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.840]   saying the iPhone 10 is a flop.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   You're going to see the supply chains analysts.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.800]   Everybody said the iPhone 10, it's not selling.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.040]   And Apple comes out and said, yeah, actually it's so pretty well.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.800]   In fact, it was the number one smartphone in Q1 in the US.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   And by the way, we made a little money.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.080]   Another record quarter for Apple.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   Well, I'm starting to realize that when you read these stories about Apple not selling
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.760]   iPhone 10s, it's probably short sellers trying to depress the stock or something.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.120]   That's one of the theories there.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.640]   How much does things interfere?
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   It's fascinating.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.840]   I end up transcribing these financial calls for iMore.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.480]   Sitting through and hearing these things as I'm typing them out furiously and getting
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.040]   those all put together, it's like, oh, you check off different boxes in your head.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.080]   Oh, yeah, we saw the story about how this was failing or this was failing.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.840]   And then Tim Cook just quietly and very calmly reveals that the iPhone 10 sold incredibly
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.200]   well and Apple's doing well here and here and here.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:01.640]   It's incredible how much there's differentiation, I think, between the financial area and then
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.640]   sort of what Apple ends up announcing.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.240]   Yeah, I never liked Apple rumors, but that really can lead you astray if you start as
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.360]   we did, I think, saying, oh, maybe the iPhone 10 is not a success.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.400]   And obviously isn't it always the case though with the financial analysts, they seem to
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.360]   have broader expectations regardless of the company, not just Apple, just most people
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   in general.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   Mm.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.800]   Revenue up 14% year over year on the iPhone, that's, I guess, a gain.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.720]   That sounds like a gain.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   Device sales.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.920]   Now, part of the reason the revenue is up because it was a much more expensive phone.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.760]   The vice sales were also up 3% year over year.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.920]   Quarterly down 38%, but you expect that.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.480]   This is the Q2 for Apple.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.960]   This is not their big selling quarter.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.480]   This is the quarter following the announcement of the phone.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.360]   Max sales down and I, some people attributed that to the really horrible keyboard choice
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.560]   that Apple made on the MacBook Pros.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   I would.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.520]   3% drop in max sold and it may also be that their people are waiting for the next Mac
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.480]   Pro or something like that.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.600]   What's really interesting is that services have now eclipsed iPad and Macintosh.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.360]   In fact, service revenue, $9.2 billion was bigger than the two combined.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.240]   It is now Apple's number two revenue generator.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   That's, Micah.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.000]   And it's apps in the App Store and Apple Music and iCloud.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.240]   Is that the three things that contribute to that?
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   I believe so.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.040]   That's the, those are at least the ones that they certainly touch on.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   Especially Apple Music sort of takes the front lead there and they always talk about the
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.760]   App Store selling really well.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   That's where they make the most.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.920]   I would imagine the bulk of the money.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.480]   The Apple Pay falls in there too.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   Apple Pay.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   Micah, do you, I was going to say Micah, do you think Apple Pay is one of the things that
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.800]   is sort of a quiet Trojan horse of an earner because it feels like more and more people
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.040]   are jumping on Apple Pay and then, you know, they get a, I'm sure they get a small percentage
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   of whatever gets charged from card companies.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.160]   So that's going to be over time.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.040]   I would imagine that's like a real nice chunk of change for them.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   I can see that coming.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.640]   I mean, you know, it's because it's not so user facing that it is sort of the secret
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.080]   thing because we sort of see Apple Pay as just this, oh, I hold my phone up.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   It does this thing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.200]   Where does the money come from?
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   But yes, Apple is getting a little bit of a pull in that and we've got, especially in
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.480]   China, the transit systems are now getting involved with Apple Pay and I'm not sure if
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.640]   there's any financial gain in that.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.320]   But I mean, that's a huge thing.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.680]   So we continue to hear about them announcing, oh, you know, Apple Pay is available here.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   It's available here.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.040]   It's available for these different things.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.920]   And I think we're going to continue to see that grow as a real earner for them in terms
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   of services.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.240]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.680]   That must be a huge win for them to own the, I guess that's a touch to pay for the underground
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.880]   in China and things like that and buses and so forth.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.440]   That's got a huge make it so easy.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.800]   I'll just say I always have my phone out for everything.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.280]   So it's like, I mean, just in general, anything that's tapped to pay with my phone just makes
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.080]   life so much easier.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.640]   And it's like they get a cut of that every time.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   That's crazy.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   In Japan, I didn't see a lot of that.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.440]   They were still swiping cards in a lot of places.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.920]   But most places in Japan, it's cash.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   Really?
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   That's interesting.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.160]   Yeah, I know the Japan is cash.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   It will rules.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.520]   Yeah, Japan is such an interesting country because it's both in the future and in the
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.760]   past at the same old thing.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.960]   They still a lot of cash going on.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.160]   It took a long time for them to adopt smartphones to write that was a lot of flip phones there
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.160]   for a long time.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.640]   Yeah, because they had that eye pocket or whatever they called it that was really a
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.160]   full service.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.000]   It was a computer in a phone.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Yeah, and they loved it.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   That was a huge deal there.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.680]   Yeah, I didn't see a lot of iPhones in Japan.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.160]   However, I see nothing but iPhones here in the United States.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.360]   Clearly, clearly a big success so much so that Apple has announced also that they're
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   going to buy back $100 billion worth of their shares.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.000]   People were wondering, what is Apple going to do with their giant cash trove?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   What is it?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.760]   Almost $270 billion at last count.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.680]   And I think there is somebody sitting in a vault somewhere like Scrooge with Duck counting
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   it.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   It's a dragon.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   It's an actual dragon.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.600]   Yeah, but if they bought an actual dragon, it's an act guard the money that a guard all
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   done on.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   Exactly.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   It must be a rather large.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   It's hard.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   Yes, smog, hoard.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.840]   They are going to spend some of it buying back stocks.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.000]   And that is actually good news for shareholders.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.640]   In fact, Warren Buffett seems thrilled.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.240]   Warren Buffett announced at their Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings that they're going
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.000]   to buy even more Apple.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.240]   They purchased 75 million shares of Apple during the first quarter.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.320]   So they obviously, the oracle of Omaha is not yet convinced that Apple is done.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.800]   He sees a lot more growth.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   He says the 100 billion.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.640]   I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.320]   I love the idea of having our 5% or whatever it is.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   Oh, come on, Warren.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.840]   You know exactly what it is.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   5% or whatever it is.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.680]   Maybe growing to 6% or 7% without laying in a dime.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.560]   That's what buybacks do for current shareholders.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.960]   It's the reverse of dilution, I guess, concentration of the value.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.760]   So that's Berkshire Hathaway has $44 billion worth of Apple stock, 240 million shares.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   And by the way, that was really good news for Apple.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.640]   The stock price went out when Berkshire Hathaway announced that went up and Tim Cook said,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.200]   "I'm thrilled that Buffett is a major investor."
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   I'm thrilled.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.640]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640]   I'm thrilled.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   5%.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   That's a huge stake.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.560]   A huge stake.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.480]   I also saw where Buffett said that he was wrong about Google and Amazon and what he didn't
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   invest in them.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.720]   A shareholder asked him, "They have this annual meeting in Omaha and people comments.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.440]   It's kind of a hoe down and very friendly."
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.560]   A shareholder said, "Because Bill Gates is in the audience.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.000]   He's good friends with Warren Buffett.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.040]   He said, "Well, Warren, how come you buy all this Apple?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.000]   You've never bought Microsoft."
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.280]   And Buffett said, "Well, I didn't buy in the beginning because I was stupid.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.800]   And I don't buy it now because I'm friends with Bill and I feel like that that might,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.000]   people might take it the wrong way."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   Which I thought was interesting, of course.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.080]   But he does say, "Google, he didn't buy Google stock because..."
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.080]   Or Amazon stock.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.480]   He's in it by Amazon stock because Amazon is a miracle and I don't bet on miracles.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.040]   Wow.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.440]   Like Amazon success is, I guess, a one-off.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   And it's true.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.800]   I mean, you look at it and you go, "You can't knock him.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.640]   He usually knows what he's talking about."
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   He's not.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   He didn't diss Amazon.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.760]   He just said, "It's not the kind of thing I invest in."
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   He did diss and so did his partner cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.760]   Saying, "It's like gold.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.440]   It isn't a producing investment.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.840]   Not only invested producing investments, not investments that the price is determined
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.120]   by merely by what people are willing to pay for it."
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   Which I thought was interesting.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.920]   And he also said there are a lot of kind of shady characters involved in Bitcoin and
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   I don't...
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   They didn't like that.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:45.040]   I think his partner was even more dismissive of cryptocurrencies calling them more.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.560]   Yeah, right about the same time the GPU's pricing started to get back down.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.360]   You can actually get a video card at a reasonable price now, yeah.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Wow.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   Wow.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.880]   Which pisses me off because it's just last month when I spent money from mine.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.880]   Really how much did you...
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.360]   For that thing behind you right there?
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   For that monster behind me.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.960]   Yeah, because in video they overspent on it.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.360]   Yeah, I have a GTX 1066 gigabyte.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.120]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.960]   You could have spent more.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.520]   True, right?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   True.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   True.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.920]   Dare I ask how much you paid for the 1060?
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.160]   I think it was almost 600 when I got it.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   Wow.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   Wow.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   That was pissed.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.720]   Because you had to have it, right?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   You couldn't wait.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.240]   You had to have it because Lightroom and After Effects and all of that, they need...
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.240]   You got to have it.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.440]   That rendering, you know?
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.440]   Yep.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   Got it.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   Got to have it.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.360]   Well, I've crashed my Windows machine so...
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   I apologize.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   Not just me having issues over here.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.880]   A sudden delay in the show.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   Edge didn't like...
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.920]   All the machines are hungover.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.120]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   That's who it is.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   Maybe that's...
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.440]   Becky Worley did something mean to me.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.480]   Wow.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.600]   What is happening here?
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.240]   It's probably the spring update.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.000]   Anybody got the 1803 for Windows 10?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.680]   Have anybody installed it yet?
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   I...
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.920]   No, I have enough.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   Don't.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.680]   This is actually...
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   You know what?
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   This is a surface.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.160]   A Microsoft product and I don't even have 1803 yet and I seem to have completely died.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   So I shall reboot my computer.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.960]   I've been trying to watch and see what all the reports are for people that have installed
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.480]   it but I'm not hearing anything just yet.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.560]   I haven't had any problems.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.080]   On the other hand, it's not much of an update.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.000]   I mean, it is and it isn't.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.760]   You know, from the point of view of the user, I don't think you're going to see a lot of
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   changes.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.720]   You know what I want to see with this though?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   What?
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.560]   If you have a Windows laptop and you're doing what you do, seriously, my dog wants to run
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   up here now with his little bell.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   Hello, Doggy.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   Hello.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   Hello, Doggy.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.640]   Hello, puppy.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.160]   But you have a Windows laptop and you're working, doing whatever you want to do and you decide
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.440]   to just close the lid, step away for a few minutes and come back, open the lid.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.680]   It refuses to let you log back in without doing a four shutdown because hibernate or
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.760]   sleep or whatever that feature is, decided to just bork on you.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.400]   Well, this is borked.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.040]   And they don't put reset buttons on PCs anymore.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.880]   So now I hold that.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   I know this is a bad thing to do.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.960]   Like an animal, like a savage, hold the on off button until it gives up.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   It's not working.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   Sad.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   Really sad.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   Choking it out, essentially.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   Exactly.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.680]   Choking the life out of your computer.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.960]   Oh, no, it's not even that's not doing anything.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   Oh, no.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.120]   I gotta do the I gotta do the bad thing now.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120]   Oh, man.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   I get it all the way.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.240]   And plugged it.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.240]   That is cruel.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.080]   I can't believe what I just saw.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.040]   I'm an animal.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:14.280]   So this all makes me nostalgic for the Macintosh today, May 6th, the 20th anniversary of the
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.640]   Macintosh will celebrate as soon as, but I'm going to take a break while my computer
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.800]   reboots will celebrate in just a little bit.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.120]   Great to have you, and Pruitt from Tech Republic, Ashley, a Sketha.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.800]   Oh, we've got you all of a sudden Ashley turning to Ant and Ant turning Ashley Ashley
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.400]   is Sketha professional gamer.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   Exactly.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.600]   Like we could be siblings.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Siblings.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   Definitely.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   I thought you were twins.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   I did.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   Twin siblings from different mothers.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.400]   And of course, it's a wonderful Micah Sergeant.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   Great to have you as well.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.600]   Senior editor of Mobile Nations.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.320]   And our show today brought to you by women.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:57.360]   And hold on, I have to, I just have to say hello to Windows.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.000]   For those of you listening at home, I had to actually duck down behind my computer so
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.040]   that the camera could see me.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.360]   And I knew this week she was going to be awesome.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.720]   Because I'm jet lag.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.120]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.600]   I'm just a little teeny.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   We need a bit.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.840]   I'm still on Tokyo time.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.080]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.560]   I'm happy to say Quicken Loans now the number one lender in the nation.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.880]   I have to say, I think we take a little bit of credit for that.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.360]   Quicken Loans was always been number one in your heart's number one in customer satisfaction
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   according to JD Power for the last eight years running.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.800]   That's in mortgage origination.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.280]   There are number one in customer satisfaction for mortgage servicing for the last four consecutive
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   years.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   I mean, these guys are winners.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.120]   And Quicken Loans ought to be a winner because I just think it's a great company.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.000]   They've completely renovated, revitalized the inner city in Detroit.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.520]   Dan Harmon and his team do a great job.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   And I think that they looked at the mortgage approval process and said, this is a little
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   antiquated.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.880]   This is straight out of Charles Dickens here.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.160]   We have to go to a bank, hat in hand and say, please, sir, I'd like some money to buy
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.400]   a home.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.240]   And they say, home here's a home.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.600]   Here's your application.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   You got to go home and get all sorts of information.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.680]   For us, it meant not only that filling out this long application, giving it to them, but
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.320]   then they'd come back and said, we need this and that you got pay stubs from your last
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.120]   job and fax them to us.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.320]   And I not only had to find the pay stubs, I had to find a fax machine.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.080]   This is crazy.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.160]   All comes rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans, a completely online mortgage approval process
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.320]   that takes around, well, maybe even less 10 minutes, 10 minutes.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.200]   You could do it in an open house.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   No more paperwork.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.520]   No more even going to the bank.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.800]   You don't have to get up for the account.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   Just go to rocket mortgage.com/twit2 and answer some simple questions.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.840]   They have relationships with all the financial institutions.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.360]   So it's very easy.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.400]   They'll get the information they need, crunch the numbers, all this while you're actually
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.720]   sitting there on there because it takes so little time, they can come back to you and
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.640]   say, look, based on your income assets and credit, here's the loans you qualify for.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.800]   You pick the rate.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   You pick the term.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.200]   You pick the down payment.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.360]   You get the loan.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   Boom.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.760]   You're done.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.080]   Rocket Mortgage.com/twit2.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.800]   If you're looking by your first home of your tenth, Rocket Mortgage is the new and better
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.160]   way to do it.

[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:44.520]   nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 30, 30, rocket mortgage.com/twit2.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.560]   You'll actually save time if you get in there and bookmark it.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.200]   Oh, he's brought me another Windows laptop.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   Thanks, John.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.560]   This one's updated to 1803, by the way.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.000]   So let me see if I can find the videos.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.600]   For Steve Jobs, it was on this day 20 years ago.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:10.720]   It's hard to believe that Steve Jobs introduced the IIMac.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:17.040]   Now you've got to remember Apple at this time, Steve had been back about a year.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.640]   Apple fired Steve, right?
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.320]   So that's the first thing.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.000]   He was unceremoniously shown the door by John Scully.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.200]   He did a few things quite well subsequently, including buying Pixar for pennies on the dollar.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.880]   Let me find this part of the intro.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   But the very famously, the thing that he did is he went and sat down with the Apple team
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.920]   and said we have too many products.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.600]   Remember, this was when Apple was doing clones.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.400]   They had let other people make Macintosh.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.880]   They had way too many confusing brands.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.720]   He drew a plus sign on the whiteboard and said, "We're going to make four products.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.000]   Consumer professional desktop portable."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   That's it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.920]   Of course, the Macintosh was a desktop.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.320]   The power book was the laptop for pros.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.360]   And then he decided we're going to update the consumer desktop with something that at
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.520]   the time was quite revolutionary.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   And this is the IMac.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.920]   You've got to see this thing in person, but I'll do the best I can with video.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   This is IMac.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.400]   The whole thing is translucent.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   You can see into it.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   It's so cool.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   Remember named after the Sydney Australia.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.720]   Scarios speakers on the front.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.200]   We've got infrared right up here.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.080]   We've got the CD-ROM drive right in the middle.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.720]   By the way, we should mention that this introduction, this product intro was almost killed according
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.520]   to Walter Isaacson in the Jobs biography.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.360]   Because when Steve first saw this the day before, he said, "That's supposed to be a
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.720]   slot for the CD-ROM.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   What's this button?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.120]   What's this drawer?"
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.440]   John Rubenstein said, "Well, Steve, you approved that."
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.040]   He said, "No, I want a slot."
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.200]   And he almost killed it.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   The team was able to get the IMac introduced by saying, "Well, the next one will have a
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   slot."
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   Is that okay, Steve?
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.440]   Oh my gosh.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.360]   He's looking at that slot right now in this speech and going, "Ah!"
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.200]   But he greeted his teeth and they released it with this.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.360]   Stereo headphone jacks.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.000]   Wait a minute, by the way, that's weird, but it has two headphone jacks in front.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I'm not sure why.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.240]   And then get ready for this.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.040]   Coolest mouse on the planet right now.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   Not really.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   Nope.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   Nope.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   Not even close.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.800]   He brought Mike Markola, one of the guys he'd fired a year before, but one of the original
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.240]   Apple founders, he brought him in.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.520]   He was so proud of the IMac.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   Jobs showed him the IMac.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.760]   Markola was impressed and then Jobs showed him this, the Apple IMac and the clock.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.480]   And Markola said, "That's terrible.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.320]   Nobody's going to want that."
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.520]   And Steve said, "No, it's the best mouse we've ever made."
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.800]   The worst mouse ever made.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.200]   And Apple really hasn't improved much on it.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.720]   I'm sorry to say, I still use Microsoft mice on my Mac and Tashes.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.240]   But wasn't that the worst mouse?
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.040]   It didn't fit your hand.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.200]   If you hold it in your palm, your finger was going off the edge.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   The cliffhanger.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.640]   That's the brilliance and detriment.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.600]   The cliffhanger.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.200]   Look how short the cord is.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   Aw.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But it is Bondi Blue.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   All right.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Is that the right blue?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Does that fit your blue?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.440]   That was another one I was reading earlier on the show.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.080]   Before the show began, I was doing a dramatic reading from Walter Isaacson's book in which
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.920]   it turned out that the ads that Shiant Day had taken out the magazine ads for this new,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.440]   and by the way, let's not forget how awful PCs looked in 1998.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.400]   I mean, this really was a revolution.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.240]   Yeah, this was a revolution.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.040]   But Steve was very particular about the color blue, this translucent blue.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.240]   And he said, "The magazine ad is not the same blue."
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.240]   And a cloud from Shiant Day said, "No, it's the same blue."
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.120]   No, it's not the same, everything blue.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.160]   And he's yelling and screaming at the guy.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.960]   And finally, cloud gets him to go look at the pictures and actually hold them up next
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   and it's the same blue.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.320]   It's the same.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.440]   Anyway, let's show some more, Steve.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.640]   This is pre-Turtle Nexty, but a year later when he introduced the Mac, I'm Mac Book, he's
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.360]   wearing a black turtleneck and a little bit of a beer.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.360]   But this one he's wearing-
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.000]   Come on around, all of the connectors.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   White shirt with no tie.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   White shirt with no tie.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   One beautiful little door here, the ethernet, the US new stuff.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.760]   Look at the beautiful little door.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.120]   Around the back, we've got a really great handle here.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:49.040]   Johnny Ives says, "There's no point in a handle on a 38 pound desktop computer."
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.520]   Not to mention the fact that it adds immensely to the cost, the case for this alone was
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   $30, which is much more, 10 times more than the PC cases on those other computers.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.960]   $60 it was.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.240]   But I've said I'm going to put a handle on it because it makes it feel personal and Steve
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   loved that.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.800]   So you can see he's happy with him.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.120]   Back of this thing looks better than the front of the other guys, by the way.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   And then, round the shot.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.800]   Let's take one more swing around it so you can see this is what it looks like.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.040]   And again, you've got to see one of these things in person.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.400]   He was such a good salesman.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   What he doesn't mention is-
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   Truly.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   The big thing missing.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.080]   Anybody remember what you just looked at?
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   What was missing from this?
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.720]   It was huge at the time.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   A floppy disk.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   No floppy.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   No floppy.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.200]   USB ports, which was then pretty early for USB.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   But no floppy.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   It was the LED, a 24X.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.240]   That was the removal of the headphone jack, but in the 90s.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.120]   Actually, oddly enough, this thing has not won not two but three.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   Fuck jacks.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.320]   There's two in the front and one in the side.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.960]   That's where my headphone jack went.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   Wait.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.760]   They took all the headphone jacks and put them in the iMacs.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.440]   From the one that streamed to the other.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.240]   I have to say though, and I think that Apple, when Phil Schiller was talking about the courage
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.160]   of taking out the headphone jack on the iPhone, I think he was thinking back to the fact that
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   in 1998, we got rid of the floppy and we were right.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.680]   And I think they were right to get rid of the floppy, right?
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.840]   Phil, say that.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   Don't say courage.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:27.800]   Like, be like in 1998, we got rid of the floppy disk and people thought we were nuts.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.040]   And now we're getting rid of the headphone jack and that seems crazy too.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.280]   But we feel really confident that the future of, you know, the future of mobile is wireless
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.440]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.320]   Don't just walk out there and say courage.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Courage.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   Courage.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.960]   I'm just real hating that whole movement because right now I'm sitting at my desk and
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.440]   I'm digging into my pocket to pull this out because after I have to make sure I have
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.960]   dongles, dad gum dongle with me.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.680]   Because I hate Bluetooth audio on my phone.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.880]   Well, you know, I was traveling and I had to make sure that I had a, I had to have two
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.520]   dongles because the same courage that Apple showed, Google showed with the, with the,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   right.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.040]   I was darned with the pencil too and no headphone jack there.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.440]   So I have a type C dongle and a lightning dongle and I, different kinds of courage.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.040]   Different kinds of courage.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   So this was a.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Lightening courage.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.320]   This original iMac was G3 based.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.520]   Anyone want to take a guess at the clock speed of this G3?
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   1.3.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   Oh boy.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.520]   That's going to be low.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   I can say.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.520]   About 400 megahertz.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   I believe.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   233 megahertz.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   Wow.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:44.920]   Not gigahertz kids back in the day we had megahertz and we were happy.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   We didn't have floppy drives.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.440]   512 backside level two cache.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.880]   We had to talk about that in those days.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   I don't know why.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   32 megs of RAM.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   That was a lot.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.320]   It went all the way up to 128 megs.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   I think that was a lot.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.720]   But remember this is systems system eight, which needed all that RAM because it didn't
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   have a memory manager.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   Mm.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.520]   ATI rage pro turbo graphics.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.440]   Oh, see that's what you should have got instead of that.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.760]   I could play King's Quest though.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.000]   I don't have no floppy.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   King's Quest.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I can't put my keys.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I can't play my less manly in search for the king.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   No Hugo's house of horrors.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   I can't play any of those games.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.520]   How old 20 years ago you were a kid when this came out, right?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   You were a teenager.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   Teenager.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.760]   Did you have one?
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.040]   I did not have I wanted one really bad.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:42.520]   I begged my parents, but my dad ever the frugal and intelligent man that he is for my high
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:48.680]   school graduation instead of getting me an iMac built me a computer from scratch with
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.920]   the help of our local PC building company.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.000]   It was like a PC repair company.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   You know what?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.960]   Your dad made you the woman you are today right on dad.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.360]   You lasted me for almost 10 years.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.240]   So I can't complain about it.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.840]   It was a beige box.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   It was hideous.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   It was absolutely horrible.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.000]   And man, that thing just like kept on kept on ticking.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.080]   So it was way where I worked out.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   Good.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.560]   I absolutely was a kid when this when this came out and I can remember being I didn't
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.640]   have one at home, but at school, like that little puck fit my hand just my tiny little
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   hand just fine.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   So it was like second grade.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.240]   It was made for your tiny little hand.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   Yeah, it was perfect.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   It was good at that point.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   They should have said that.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   It was made for Micah's tiny little hand.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.200]   Yeah, Steve, you should have known.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   If you did only known you would really so you liked this.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   I have one.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   I don't know why we.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   As a kid, I did.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.120]   I think you should you should wear it around your neck like flavor.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.320]   I'll get it, but you'll too Leo.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.560]   Make it a necklace and get it.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   Beautiful.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   You know, I could do it.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   I could do it.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Steve did.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.600]   So Steve apparently hadn't yet become the fashion icon.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.240]   He's got a white shirt buttoned at the top.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   Oh, I'm loving this.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   This is a look.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.880]   I think this would actually look really good.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   It's a luke.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   There you go.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   It's a luke.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   It's a luke.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.120]   It's a this is you get that thing bedazzled with an L L on it.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.160]   Oh, that was a good look.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.640]   I need to screenshot this.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.000]   How much will you pay me if I wear this for the rest of the show?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.920]   It's a Bondy blue.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Bolo.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.120]   I love it.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   This is how.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.120]   I get you've got all the.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   Bondy blue.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   Bolo.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.040]   They make people wear stuff like this to let you know it's the future.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   Right?
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   Wow.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   You're going to be like the next Katy Perry music video where.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   He must be from the future.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.080]   He's wearing a mouse is a bolo tie.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.480]   A mouse from 1998.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.200]   I'm kind of surprised ready player one didn't have some some sort of tribute to the Bondy
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   blue.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   I'm back.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   I guess it's pre it was 1998.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   It's funny.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.600]   It's not really not that long ago, was it?
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   That's crazy.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   Anyway, happy birthday.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:07.360]   That jobs was at least it seemed like just Apple back in the days anyway, they always
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.600]   wanted to give it that human touch and just relate to the regular person and not necessarily
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.520]   the big businesses or whatever.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.880]   And they just kept doing that for each generation.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   That's it.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.960]   He very appreciate the fact they wanted to make something that look nice in your house.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   That's like my biggest thing.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.920]   Even now I have a mini ATX case for my Windows PC that I built last year.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   And it's like I bought a case that looks nice.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.400]   Like I want it to look nice.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.960]   Has to look good to be functional.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.240]   Like that was always the thing that I appreciated about your cases.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   No, absolutely not.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.040]   I actually I think I might have the right to tie for this occasion.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.840]   Oh my goodness.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.840]   That's the one we founded.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.520]   I found I don't know where John found it.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.800]   You save every mouse that we ever had.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.880]   This is a ladies and gentlemen who are not watching this episode.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.080]   I you're really missing out.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   This is how.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   Really a moment in it.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.400]   This is how fashion fashion statements are born.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   Yes.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   Is that all shot?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   I'm going to try a moment.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.960]   Now would you have that would you have the scroll wheel up or down?
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   I think up.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   I think you guys.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.360]   Is that it looks like you're going to click on your face?
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.240]   I might just click on my face.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   So stand back.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   Oh man.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.640]   People just walk up to you and click on it.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   Would that weird you out?
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   Be careful about that.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   This mouse biting clicks.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   Come come click me.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   This is click me.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.400]   Oh, in the future.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.680]   It's the original click bait in the future everyone.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.240]   I don't I oh here's a problem.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.840]   I got to find something to do with the there we go the connector.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   There you go.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   Nailed it.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.440]   If it lights up you could put that like a battery pack.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.440]   Oh, it does.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.440]   Sure it does.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.440]   Does it?
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   All right.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.040]   Well, I'll carry a battery pack.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.440]   By the way, little PSA.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.080]   It's kind of embarrassed.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   I was sitting on the plane ready to leave Japan and a very nice flight attendant with
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.240]   wearing a mask, which is a little scary, but they all wear masks.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.560]   Comes up to me and says, Mr. report you have to get off the plane.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.080]   And I go and apparently I had left two of these, you know, these battery packs that
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.000]   you carry in my in my check luggage.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.520]   You can't do that anymore.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   Can't do it.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.240]   Is that you knew this?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   Mm hmm.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   All right.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.800]   It was like heaven and carry on so you can see.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   Oh my God.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   I don't want it to like catch fires.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   Please.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   Wow.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   Now we're talking.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   It's so good though.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   All right.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   That is a good look.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   Does it?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   It's like Hunger Games.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   Yes, it's very Hunger Games.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.840]   It's very C's are flicker minute view.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.160]   I should be in the Hunger Games.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:04.360]   So don't tell me, but so we're in Japan when Infinity Wars war comes out and I'm sad because
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   I really want to go.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   You all seen it.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   I'm sure by now.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   Yes.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   I've yet to see it.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.680]   Well, apparently I had to avoid Twitter because apparently there's something happens
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.480]   at the end everybody's upset about.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.120]   I've been I've been here and all that.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.600]   No one has spoiled it.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.040]   No, no spoilers.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.280]   Even that was probably too much for some people.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.280]   Hashtag Thanos demands your silence.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.120]   See, that's a spoiler.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.720]   No, that's the one that Russo brothers put out.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.640]   They were like, "Thanos demands your silence."
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.760]   That was the- Oh, that's the silence they demand.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   Don't tell me.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   But no spoilers campaign.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.240]   They were like, "Don't tell anybody want people to be excited and surprised."
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.800]   I've seen it twice.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   I enjoyed it.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.280]   It's not my top five Marvel movies, but it's certainly in the top 10.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.120]   How many- What do they call the little things they show at the end?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   How many of those are there?
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.920]   Because I like to know when I can leave.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   That's one.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   But it's at the very end.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   Of course it is.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.280]   And also the credits are very long because a lot of people worked on this one.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   A lot takes a lot.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.280]   That's right.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   All right.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.840]   But I mean, it's a fun little post credit scene.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.200]   I think I have invented the clickbait tie.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   It is.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   Boy.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.120]   Make sure you get a really nice high res picture of that so you can make your profile
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   picture.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.120]   Okay.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   It's a good idea.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   That's your 2018 headshot.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.000]   That's your 2018 headshot.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.280]   Did you put up a throwback Thursday headshot?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.160]   As everybody did, I felt so left out on Instagram.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   I did.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   Really?
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.760]   So, here, Kiplea's back back on my Instagram.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.960]   You might think I'm stalking you, Mrs. Squetha.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.320]   But no, I just like your pictures.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.520]   Let me see if I can find your...
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   Is this it?
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   Oh, it is.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.520]   Holy cow.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.160]   That was at the Union Station in Los Angeles.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   That's a great headshot.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.640]   It was a good shot.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.200]   I had a crazy haircut at the time.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   So, it was fun.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Everybody's put...
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   I have my...
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   This is embarrassing.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.440]   You want to see my...
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.800]   This is the oldest headshot I could find.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.440]   I can't wait.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.440]   I think...
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.840]   Are you wearing a mouse as an ec-tie?
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   Practically.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   Oh, man.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.360]   Those suspenders are great.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   Pokedots suspenders are the...
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.200]   This is 1987.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.200]   That is the...
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   Wow.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.600]   Your tie also has polka dots on it, correct?
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.440]   It's dots and dots.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   But the...
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.440]   They're not reading...
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   That's very fashion-forward of you.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.640]   And I don't know why, but it's loosened at the neck.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.680]   Like I'm a hard-working disc jockey.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   Right.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   If you're like...
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   I feel like I got a loosen my tie.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   Hey.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   I'm gonna say some...
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   Truth.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.960]   I probably have my sleeves rolled up, but they don't show in the...
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   Aw.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   That's hilarious.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   Love it.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.160]   I wish I could get this.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   Can you give me some...
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   It's a fabric tape.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.400]   I need some fabric tape.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Thank you.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   Ashley knows.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   That's the stuff I...
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   You know what?
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   My wig tape will probably work.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   Go get that.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   Am I 2K tape?
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   Sure, great.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.120]   I think this is a good look.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   It is actually...
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   I got it genuinely.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   It's a good look.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   I'm really enjoying it.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:19.360]   And I like the glow that's coming from behind, almost like a Bondi Blue iMac, lit from behind.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.240]   Makes you just want to reach out and punch me.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.200]   Right in the face.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.760]   Interesting.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.080]   Let's take a break and then we'll talk about Cambridge Analytica because GDPR, the European
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.320]   data protection regulation goes into effect now in just a couple of weeks.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.400]   And already we're starting to see some side effects, including a lawsuit in England by
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.840]   a US...
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.000]   I don't want to say customer of Cambridge Analytica victim, maybe a better word.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.160]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.560]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   If you're a freelancer, I know we've all done it.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.600]   We've all been there where you have to send out invoices at the end of the month.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   It's the worst.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   It's the worst part of being...
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.480]   It's wonderful to have your own business.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.680]   The worst part of having your own business is having to send out invoices.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.440]   I hate it at the end of every month.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   Thank goodness.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:20.680]   In 2004, I discovered FreshBooks, the ridiculously easy to use cloud accounting system.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.200]   FreshBooks is more now than just getting fancy invoices done, although it does make
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.480]   it really easy.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.640]   It also makes it easy to get paid faster because as soon as you're using FreshBooks,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.920]   you're able to take credit cards as payments on those invoices.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.920]   And you know what?
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   Your clients love that.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.520]   You're going to get card points and you love it because you're going to get paid on average
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.160]   twice as fast because it's easy for clients to pay you.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.520]   FreshBooks does more than that.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.280]   It's not just invoices.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.960]   By doing the invoices with FreshBooks, the expenses, because yes, the FreshBooks app,
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.760]   you take a picture of a receipt, it goes right in the invoice.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.880]   So it's easy to build for expenses.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.400]   It also keeps track of hours.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.880]   So if you build for a time, it does that as well.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.040]   But in the process of doing that, you're also effectively, without even knowing it, doing
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.640]   accounting.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.080]   So you'll know in the FreshBooks dashboard exactly how much money you've made at any
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.960]   time, your total profit.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.400]   You can see what your spending is, your outstanding balances.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.720]   You can see which invoices haven't been paid yet.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.480]   You can even automatically set out reminders, create proposals.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.680]   They are always adding features.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.280]   So they've now got proposals, rich text content, images, customizable sections, and request
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.480]   your client's e-signature as they accept proposals.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.960]   So it's really, it's extending its capability even more.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.240]   There's great FreshBooks app for iOS and Android.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.960]   They automatically connect to your bank account and update expenses daily.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.920]   You can use CSV file import for importing in bulk or take a picture of receipt and upload
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   it.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   Let FreshBooks automatically do the rest.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.480]   You can manage team member rates.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   You may get paid one rate, but your team members maybe get paid another rate.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.480]   You can manage that from the My Team page, Add Team Members at different roles.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.560]   So they have different permissions.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.160]   You can also track income that doesn't come from invoices.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.240]   Online sales and ads could be tracked by logging them as other income.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.800]   So really, you get all the accounting you need done simply without really doing any
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.840]   accounting.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.520]   I love FreshBooks.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.120]   10 million people, since I started using it in 2004, now 10 million people use FreshBooks
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:32.840]   to painlessly send invoices, track time, capture expenses and get back to doing what you love.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.840]   Here's the deal.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.680]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.160]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.600]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.760]   If you do me a favor when there's a little form that says, "How'd you hear about us?"
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.560]   Just put this weekend tech in there, if you would.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.320]   The guy in the tie, FreshBooks.com.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.280]   It's very Hunger Games.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   I like it.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.320]   I think that it's gone out though.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.480]   The light has gone out.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.680]   Oh, I know why.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.720]   I put the adhesive on the light.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:16.640]   UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voters.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.960]   This is a very interesting, almost a test case.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   David Carroll is an associate professor at Parsons in New York.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   He actually tried to get Cambridge Analytica to tell him what it knew about him.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:39.320]   Cambridge Analytica refused and told the UK ICO.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:45.280]   Carroll was no more entitled to make a so-called subject access request under the UK Data Protection
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.440]   Act than a member of the Taliban sitting in a cave in the remotest corner of Afghanistan.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.480]   "Come on, there's no need to take that tone."
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.040]   The ICO, however, on Friday, this is the UK Information Commissioner's Office.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:08.160]   This is part of GDPR, told Cambridge Analytica in a landmark decision that you need to tell
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:14.960]   David Carroll everything you know about him, the information you got from Facebook and
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.480]   failure to comply is a criminal offense.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.920]   Carroll was doing this almost as a test case.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.520]   He wanted an opinion.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.680]   Now anybody in the United States who wants to know what it came to know about you as
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.880]   an American voter and where did it get the data and what did it do with it?
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.920]   Who did it sell it to?
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:41.520]   Just go to the UK Data ICO and thanks to the UK Data Protection Act, you can get that
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   information.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.840]   That is a very big deal.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.320]   I think we're going to unroll me.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.760]   Remember those fine fellows?
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:57.280]   The email service, I actually used it for years not knowing that in the, this was the
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.560]   ideas where they would unsubscribe you from newsletters you'd subscribe to and then automatically
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.800]   send you a summary if you wanted.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.040]   Turned out, they didn't really care about that.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.560]   They were just mining your Gmail and selling the information to companies like Uber.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.440]   Well thanks to the new GDPR, they're closing their doors in EU.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.640]   They say you can't use us because we can't comply.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   Wow.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.280]   Can't or won't is unclear.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:33.400]   Did Cambridge Analytica have some type of protocol in place when people were requesting
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.200]   their information and they had to go through a verification or anything like that because
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.480]   you didn't want some random Joe calling up saying that they were in the future.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.040]   Well I'm sure.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:50.640]   What you do is, as I understand it, as I understand it, he went to the UK Information Commissioner's
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   office.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.800]   Presumably they have some sort I would hope of protections in place.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.040]   This is the way it was written is like they said, you can't have it.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.760]   This is from the Guardian.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.680]   Yeah that's an interesting point.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.600]   The ICO said no, just because you live in the US, you doesn't mean you're off the hook.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.400]   You have 30 days to comply or appeal.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.240]   Interesting.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:24.360]   Carol had applied to Cambridge Analytica previously and got stuff that was basically useless.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.320]   He said Cambridge Analytica sent him a profile they had created about him but no information
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.080]   about how they created it.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   They had given me scores for different issues but I had no idea what they'd based this on
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.920]   so he decided to go to the British courts.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:46.640]   I mean I feel like a little grateful that he and the British courts have laws in place.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.960]   These data protection laws.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.440]   Because we don't.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.520]   So frustrating that we don't.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.680]   I mean this is, we talk about this all the time on Twitch whenever I come on the show.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.280]   There's always some privacy story that we talk about, some data breach, something like
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   that.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:11.800]   And I just when will lawmakers finally stand up for consumers as opposed to these companies.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.640]   And the thing is, I feel like they just won't.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.400]   And it's up to, I don't know, coders, developers.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.920]   And I find it really interesting that I read this tweet storm and you might have seen it.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.360]   It was a while back right when the Cambridge Analytica stuff broke.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:34.040]   Which was, and I apologize, I wish I remembered the name of the person who wrote this tweet
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   storm.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   It was so good.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:44.120]   And he talked about how different verticals in physics and chemistry have had their reckoning
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.600]   with ethics, right?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.720]   With ethical quandaries where physics had the bomb, right?
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.000]   And chemistry had dynamite and also chemical warfare.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.640]   These are things that chemists and physicists have to think about when they get into these
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.440]   fields, when they're developing things, they have to think, what is the worst possible
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.080]   way this could be used against people?
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.160]   And that has never actually happened in the computer science industry.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.440]   Like that has never been a consideration until now.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:20.040]   And so will it be that in the future, and that this person who wrote the threads that
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.480]   I hope in the future and going forward, younger developers will keep these things in mind
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:30.440]   and actually design products with nefarious intent in mind.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.800]   What is the worst possible use of this product?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   Because there's so much kind of starry-eyed idealism in Silicon Valley that it's easy
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.320]   a lot of times for them to overlook sort of the bad uses of their products.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.160]   A little bit of a critical thinking.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   And I hope that that's the case.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.800]   And it was such a good Twitter thread.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:57.080]   And like I said, I apologize to the person who wrote it because you were absolutely fantastic.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.640]   And I retweeted it all over the place for a while there.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:07.480]   And it was a really good kind of indicator as to where we are right now with technology.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.880]   And will we ever see this sort of moral reckoning happen in that industry?
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.440]   And I feel like it needs to.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440]   Perhaps you guys that question.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   It seems like we're all sorry.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   We're living through that.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.680]   It seems like we're living through that right now.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:29.520]   And I'm sure there are probably people when we were going through things like, okay, the
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.240]   nuclear bomb exists.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   What are we going to do about that?
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.640]   Hopefully this is the period of time where we're doing that.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:42.480]   And I think one thing that has been good, well, there are many things that have been
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.360]   good about this GDPR thing happening.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:50.480]   But one thing that's made me happy about it is it seems like companies are maybe too
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:58.720]   lazy or too concerned about potential blowbacks to not just go ahead and roll out these GDPR
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.800]   protections across their entire sort of board.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.320]   And so those of us in the United States like thank God that we're also getting included
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.560]   in many of these things.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.400]   And we get the benefit of that.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.880]   If our own lawmakers aren't going to fix it, I'm glad there's someone out there who is
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.360]   and that we get to reap the rewards of that.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.160]   >> And yeah, a lot of people.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:26.760]   >> How do we insist to these companies that they adopt those policies without laws having
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.400]   to be passed?
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:34.000]   How come we cannot as consumers demand that these companies hold themselves to those stricter
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.400]   standards for consumers because we are their product in a lot of the cases?
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:44.240]   >> Yeah, though I remember when GDPR happened and of course before that the right to be
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   forgotten a lot of us were concerned that it might break the internet.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.400]   That some of these technical requirements that the EU is putting on companies like Google
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.520]   would be impossible to implement without kind of fragmenting.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.640]   I mean, don't you worry that at the internet it might be fragmented?
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:03.840]   I mean, by the way, I'm a little bit playing devil's advocate because I am kind of grateful
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.960]   we have some privacy regulations.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:12.880]   At the same time, is it possible that just the nature of the internet and attention-based
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.760]   economies means that it's a pipe dream that privacy is just we're not going to be able
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   to do that.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.240]   And by the way, it's hard to believe that you're listening to a guy who's wearing a
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.160]   blinged-- >> Hard for us.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.160]   >> -- next tie.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.520]   But I just love-- >> Well, Ant was just saying, what were
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.520]   you saying, Ant?
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.600]   You were saying what it boils down to?
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:37.360]   >> I think it-- and I hate saying it this way, but I think of something like Mr. Robot and
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:43.120]   Daniel Suarez is demon where the right people have to get affected before something is going
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.920]   to happen.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.880]   Some big wig is going to have to have his or her data breached.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.040]   And then they're going to be up in arms and be like, why did this happen?
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040]   >> You know.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.040]   >> But I-- >> I'm not saying this was important.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.920]   >> --like we all did with Equifax, right?
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   And nothing happened.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.520]   >> No, they made money out of breach.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   >> No, it's funny.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   >> They didn't-- nobody lost money then, though.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   You're going to have to hit-- >> They have to be so--
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   >> --we don't know.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   I mean, maybe they did.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   And you're right.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.760]   If it had been a Congressman's credit card that had been breached thanks to the Equifax
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.440]   breach, we might hear about laws.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.800]   But I have to say, I don't have any confidence that US Congress can do anything effective
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.640]   to regulate technology.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.920]   And I still think the jury's still out on GDPR and what havoc that might wreak.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.480]   See, this is the problem.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.840]   And I hear I am channeling Jeff Jarvis now.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:42.640]   But this is the problem is the internet does bring us such incredible benefits.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.360]   There is absolutely a cost.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.720]   And I don't know if it's possible to separate the two.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:55.280]   I don't know if it's possible to create an internet where the privacy that you're looking
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.160]   for can be enforced, certainly not by governments.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.600]   I think I like your idea, Ashley, that maybe these companies need to do it themselves.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:10.280]   >> Yeah, and I think that privacy as we used to know it is not a thing that we can expect
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   going forward.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:17.320]   I understand that there are trade-offs I make every day when I use my Amazon assistant.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.560]   When I use-- >> Yeah, I wonder if it's even possible
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   to be crowded.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   >> --Gmail.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.480]   >> I know that there are very specific trade-offs for that.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   I get that.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:31.600]   And I think going forward the next generation of coders, users, will have.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.320]   They'll be raised in it.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.240]   And so they will not think twice about, oh, well, this is a thing where you give up information
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.920]   that you don't feel is important to you.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:50.080]   But I really wish that we lived in a more opt-in society online as opposed to an opt-out.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.280]   So I wish that they would have more stringent rules.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.760]   Like Facebook is a really good example of that.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.840]   When you start your account up, it's all opt-in.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   You have to opt-in to all of the privacy stuff.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   It's not by default.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:10.200]   This is the type of stuff that is not difficult to implement, make it easier for people to
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   keep their privacy intact if they would like to, then also just allow them to opt-out.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:22.640]   Let's look at Facebook, because Facebook pays for itself by collecting this information
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.760]   and selling it to advertisers.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.360]   I mean, the other choice would be to have a paid Facebook.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   Is that going to happen?
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   I don't think so.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:37.120]   >> I would pay for a Facebook, much like I pay for my iPhone because it's encrypted.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   My eye messages are encrypted.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.480]   >> Yeah, but you're getting hardware with an iPhone.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.480]   >> I don't...
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   >> I appreciate that.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   But I'd be willing to pay a monthly subscription.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.200]   If I knew my data wasn't going to be sold.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.520]   I am okay with that.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:53.320]   But then you run into issues with socioeconomic levels of people not being able to enjoy a
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   service.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   Do you say that poor people have to give up their data to be able to enjoy a service
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.440]   equally as somebody with money?
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.160]   Then it's not equal.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.160]   It becomes an equal situation.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.600]   >> That's what I was going to say.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:08.800]   Because there's so many people out there using Facebook that are...
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.480]   It's their internet, basically, and they can't really afford much else.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.720]   I can't see it in pay-in ten dollars a month for privacy.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   >> Right.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   >> When Zuck was asked this question...
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   >> That's a week of groceries for something.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   >> That's right.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.720]   Congress asked him.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.640]   >> When he was asked this question, he said there will all...
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.400]   And this is perhaps a paraphrase, but it's pretty close.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.240]   There will always be a version of Facebook that is free.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:38.200]   And to me, that says that they have at least considered making a version of Facebook that
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.800]   is that does cost.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.440]   If there will always be a version of Facebook that is free, that is a version of Facebook
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   so I could see this option.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:55.280]   And yes, certainly, the fact that people do use Facebook as the internet, that is a very
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.440]   real thing that we have to keep in mind.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   But at the same time, this still is a company that has been invented and brought to life
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   and that people have flocked to.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   And so it makes sense that we would give people the different options that they want
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   to have available.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:19.440]   And if you cannot go with those options, then there are others available to you that include
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:25.000]   the possibility that advertisers can pay to market to you.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.440]   Because that's one of the things I think is important to note.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.080]   >> But do you feel like that is disadvantageous to people in lower socioeconomic status?
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:40.240]   I mean, the thing is a family of four who makes $35,000 a year somewhere, like that can't
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.040]   afford for all of them to have privacy locked Facebook pages.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.440]   Like still need to use that service to do things like buy and sell in the marketplace.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:54.200]   I have neighbors who constantly are selling things like kids' clothes and furniture and
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.240]   things like that to make a couple extra bucks.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.040]   They're not particularly well off.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.680]   And to ask those people to give up their privacy because, oh, sorry, you can't afford
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   it.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.760]   It's just it's a really hard problem.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.800]   And to me, the answer is to force Facebook to again, make things opt out as opposed to
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   opt in.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:20.960]   Like when you log into these services, by default, you should be much more protected
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   than you are right now.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   >> Yeah, I think that's completely fair.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.560]   And I think that you're right about that.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:33.160]   That if we're going to go with this version that always remains free, then it makes sense
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.640]   that yes, you sort of, okay, yes, I do want to turn on facial tracking because I like
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.280]   it whenever I know that someone is posted a photo of me online.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   >> Or I want to try.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   >> As opposed to the other way around.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.840]   >> Yeah, or yeah, give it a try.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.840]   And the fact that I can go on and delete anything that I want to, that's what's most
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.840]   important to me.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.840]   And I want to give an example.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.720]   I had talked about this earlier in the week on different podcasts, but there's a Walmart
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:02.880]   that's nearby and they just upgraded a bunch of their self-serve kiosks where you can
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:07.160]   sort of go through and get your groceries and you don't have to, there's no one there.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.800]   You just swipe it through and then pay and everything.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:15.720]   Well, they upgraded these kiosks to include a webcam that's built into the monitor that's
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   looking at me.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.480]   And I've gone there a couple times now going, what there's no, it doesn't tell you what
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.800]   it's being used for.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.440]   It doesn't tell you where those videos are being sent.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   It doesn't tell you what's being done to those videos.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.760]   It doesn't tell you how they're being protected, how long they stay in the system.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:35.360]   It's genuinely, there's a part of me that wants to track down whoever I need to talk
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.840]   to and figure that out because are they doing emotional tracking on me?
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.520]   Are they trying to tie my face to my credit card number and then be able to market to
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.520]   me better?
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.520]   I mean, these are things that we have to think about.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.440]   Are they building a shopping profile for you and then selling it out to advertisers?
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:56.680]   Are they looking for certain people who they believe might have shoplifted previously in
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.680]   the store?
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.680]   Are they looking for?
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   I mean, there's a million questions.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.160]   And I think this is where it comes back to like transparency is such a problem.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.160]   We have such a problem in this industry with transparency.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.080]   These companies just don't want to tell people in plain English like, yes, like read your
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.480]   terms of service, your EULAs and everything.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.320]   But at the end of the day, nobody's reading those.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.080]   And it should just be a very plain and simple.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   This is what we use your stuff for.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.600]   We sell it.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.160]   This is how we do business.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.840]   Like, I believe that if they are honest about that and upfront about it, as opposed to trying
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.120]   to like, oh, it's an uncomfortable conversation that we don't want to have with our users
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.040]   because they don't like being spied on.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.520]   Like, I hate that.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.240]   Like, it's just be upfront about what you're doing.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   You know?
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.280]   It's going to be a challenge.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.760]   And I saw an article recently that asked the question, which I think is a legitimate question.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.480]   Can we even survive without, I mean, I've given up Facebook, but Ashley, you said that
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   might be difficult.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.320]   It would be a lot harder for me to give up Google.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.080]   And there's hundreds of other companies that I don't even, I'm not even on my radar
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.280]   that are collecting information.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   And frankly, these days, every time I install an app, I figure that company is besides giving
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.720]   me what the app's giving me is selling information about me, including location information to
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.640]   the highest bidder.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:29.240]   Every time all of the all of the free apps, I mean, there's no other option there.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.480]   I guess I'm safe.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.600]   Am I safe on an iPhone?
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.680]   No, because they asked for location information and I say yes.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.240]   And after that, you know, Apple at least warns you every once in a while, hey, you know,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.720]   this guy's looking at your location every five seconds.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   Mm hmm.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   I deny so many permissions and apps that I install.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.880]   But I think that makes you feel good.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.640]   But I doubt it's doing anything of value.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.640]   Oh, that's the thing.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.080]   It renders them useless.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   Most of the time, so I'm going to stop.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.080]   And that's, that's scary.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:05.200]   You know, I just, that's, I guess that's the question is we've, we've, we've built up
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.640]   something of great value, which is the internet based on a model that involves you giving up
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.680]   personal information to support it.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.480]   This is, nobody would disagree very valuable.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.040]   How do we reinvent it and have it not, you know, I mean, is it even possible?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.560]   I don't, I just don't think you can live without it.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.240]   I don't think it's a reinvention.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   I think it's just an evolution that will come with.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.600]   So I was telling someone the other day about fake news, somebody you, a family member of
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.640]   mine was like, I just don't understand how we're ever going to get away from.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.840]   Recognize it like being fooled by it, right?
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:57.960]   So, and I said, I feel like, and I have to trust people enough to know that going forward
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:05.800]   it much like Nigerian Prince email scams and IRS phone call scams, like we will as a society
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.960]   or as a, as a global society, we will get better at recognizing these things at combating
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.160]   these things, but it will just take time.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]   It's an evolution.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   I think the same is privacy.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.600]   If I said, okay, look, Facebook's going to be free.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.320]   It's ad supported.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.520]   Part of the deal and ad supported is that we tell you, tell the advertisers this information
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.680]   and they gave you a list of your, you know, whatever it is that they're going to sell
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:35.800]   of yours and maybe you could turn some stuff off your age, your demograph, you know, your
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   sex.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.560]   You can do now on Facebook and then, and then, and then you said, but I agree to this and
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.960]   this is the deal I'm making.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.160]   If it were all explicit, you wouldn't be against that, right?
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.960]   No, and I thought like said, if you're upfront about what you're doing, that's fine.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:56.000]   I mean, but my, my problem is when we're having our data, you know, and, and Cambridge
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.400]   Analytics has sort of its own thing because it was inappropriately acquired data and
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.120]   that's a whole, that's a whole basket of monkeys that I don't even, that's crazy.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.520]   But, but generally, like if you're playing by the rules, if these companies play by the
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.440]   rules, then it's, it should be, you should be able to, as a company, tell people exactly
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.400]   what you're using their data for and say, look, this is how we make our money.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.520]   Like we sell your information to third party services in order to turn a profit and that's
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.040]   why we can offer you this for free.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.480]   And here are the companies that we sell our data to.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.400]   And here's how you can get a copy of the data.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.160]   You feel okay with all of that, right?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.280]   And by the way, that's, that's all stuff GDPR mandates, basically.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.840]   And the right to erase it.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.880]   So, here, email me at the end of the year with, with, from your service with a list of where
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.400]   my data was sold and what you sold to them.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   There.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400]   I feel better about it just in general.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.960]   If I knew where, at least where it was going or if I had the option to know where it was
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.160]   going, I would feel better.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.640]   Well, maybe you'll feel better when you see this.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.200]   This is Facebook's apology ad, which they just recently posted.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   Oh, dear.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   Oh boy.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   We came here for the friends.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   Oh, God, I hate it already.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.880]   We got to know the friends of our friends.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:15.720]   Then our old friends from middle school, our mom, our ex, and our boss joined forces
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.200]   to wish us a happy birthday.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.440]   And we discovered our uncle used to play in a band and realized he was young ones too.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.000]   And we found others just like us.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.240]   And just like that, we felt a little less alone.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   But then something happened.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:39.280]   We had to deal with spam, clickbait, fake news, and data misuse.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.920]   That's going to change.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.920]   From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your privacy so we can
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.960]   all get back to a made Facebook good in the first place.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   Friends.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:56.800]   Because when this place does what it was built for, and we all get a little closer.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.800]   Wow.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.720]   Here together is their new...
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.160]   To play on my emotions.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   There weren't enough many.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   To play on my emotions.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.120]   Yeah, I agree, Micah.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.120]   Card degree.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.920]   I feel like it's...
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.120]   Even this apology is manipulative.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   It's a great gesture.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.120]   It's a great gesture.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:22.600]   But at the same time, all I could think about is the power of the like on there.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.800]   And the way that like just affects so many people and can really screw them up.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.480]   There are people that are posting things on Facebook and checking for the likes every
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   five minutes.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.960]   Something's wrong there, you know.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:40.160]   Teenagers will post a picture on Instagram and if it doesn't get a hundred likes in 24
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.560]   hours, they'll just pull it down.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   Dilly it.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560]   Because it doesn't look good.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.600]   So, I mean, there's other things that we have to consider.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600]   There's definitely some bad effects.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   It's a bad effect.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   The answer.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   The whole privacy problem.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.200]   There's another psychological thing that has to be addressed.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.720]   A societal thing that we need to really work on.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   And much like what we were talking about before the show, and Micah and we were all
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.960]   talking about trolls.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:12.040]   So this societal kind of understanding that that's dishonorable.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040]   It's a shame.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.080]   What I was talking about is in Japan, which is a very, very orderly country.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.620]   And there are a number of reasons for this.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.080]   Not the least of which is it's a completely uniform company, a country.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.080]   There are no black people.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.640]   There's no Hispanics.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.160]   It's just they're all ethnic Japanese from almost for entirely.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:39.120]   But there's also this very strong social pressure to conform.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.760]   And as a result, there's no littering.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.560]   There's no, I didn't see any graffiti.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.480]   They have crime, but it's pretty much organized crime.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:53.160]   There's no kind of general low petty crime as far as I could tell.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.480]   And it seems to me, now somebody's going to tell me you're completely wrong, but it
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:04.480]   seemed to me that that was really a result of a strong societal pressure that people
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.360]   cared about what other people thought of them.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.360]   And they didn't want to be, you know, you don't speak loudly in the train.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:15.000]   And they enforced that because somebody looks at you and you go and you just shut up.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.040]   And that works to me.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.320]   And Jeff Jarvis has always said this, that that's what we need.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.520]   We need norms to protect us from the worst of the internet, not laws.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.120]   And I think there is something to be said for, obviously, we are a very different culture
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.240]   than Japan and for better or for worse.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.280]   And you know, some of that is for the better.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.880]   You know, we are here in the US, we're excellent salespeople.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:46.960]   Like kids are taught from a very young age to present themselves, ideas, homework, projects.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.680]   I mean, it's just a constant thing.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   And that's something that I know a lot of other cultures look at.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.320]   And they say, you know, like, like we talked about Steve Jobs being a great salesperson.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.080]   This is like a big thing.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.080]   And other cultures, they look to, you know, a lot of Western countries or presentation
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.840]   sales abilities to like kind of put yourself out there.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.320]   But on that same note, it's like, it's so hard because it's like, we're never going
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.200]   to be that culture.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.000]   So we have to find a way to do that sort of for ourselves.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.200]   Well, I don't know what it is.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.440]   I do think that Steve Jobs is revered not only as an innovator, but also a great way
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.840]   to sell a steaks.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.360]   This is South Korea.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.680]   The steak jobs.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:35.840]   Steak jobs with a picture of Steve in a, oh, yeah, it's a franchise and a picture of Steve
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.320]   in a chef's hat with his trademark wire rim spectacles and for some reason, no parent
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.800]   reason, a mouse giant mouse cursor.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800]   That's not mine.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   That's an app icon.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:51.200]   So you got to click on the stick jobs app.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   His legal team.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200]   We write this.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.000]   Yeah, no, I don't know.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   I mean, a crack a team of legal people with cease and desist out to Korea.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.400]   It's not Steve Jobs.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.600]   It's steak jobs and a job.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.600]   Steve's cousin.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   He's cousin.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.400]   They look a lot alike.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400]   Steve's cousin steak.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.440]   No, it's very distant cousin because wasn't he a vegetarian?
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.200]   I'd like to meet that guy.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.800]   Let's take a little break.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.480]   Well, I'll take it out in the public is very rare.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.280]   Hey, by the way, you were talking and actually this resonated with me about how maybe if
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.800]   technologists thought about the impact of the technologies they created, I would love
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   to see that.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.520]   And I think we as geeks need to create a societal norm that if you're going to be a programmer
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.920]   and engineer, a designer, you need to think about how a product will be used or misused.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.520]   And one of the things that came home to me, one of the two of the places we visited in
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.480]   Japan were Nagasaki and Hiroshima, of course.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.120]   Nagasaki, as they put it, the last city that hit by an atomic bomb.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.880]   Let's hope it stays that way.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.840]   Hiroshima the first.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.320]   And there's very much that sense of technologists need to consider what they're building.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.440]   I mean, and at the same time, Robert Oppenheimer and all the people worked on the Manhattan
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:17.640]   Project, including my, by the way, my maternal grandfather, worked on it because they wanted
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   to save the world.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   They want to make the world a better place.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.440]   They wanted to stop the Nazis and they knew if they didn't do it, the Nazis would, et
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.480]   cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.840]   And there's even a very cogent argument.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.640]   I'm not sure I agree with it about why they had to drop an atomic bomb on a city and destroy
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.120]   it, two cities and destroy them.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.680]   I met a guy who was a survivor of Hiroshima.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.480]   He was 13 working in the Mitsubishi Arms Plant and he was there at the Hiroshima Memorial
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.720]   and he just wanted to meet Americans and thank them.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.080]   Talk about a gracious person, thank them.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   He survived it.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.880]   He said, everybody, it was me and one other guy survived.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.480]   The rest of them were died.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.600]   He was, he's in his 80s now, of course.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.520]   And he said, but we were starving and we, and the Americans came and they brought us food
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.680]   and they, and, and you know, it's true that MacArthur kind of remade that country.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.160]   Wow.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.400]   So it's complicated.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:19.560]   I think it's complicated to have a moral compass that says this is going to be okay and this
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   is not going to be okay.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560]   It's very difficult.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560]   Go ahead.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   I'm sure Ashley.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   I found the guy who wrote the thread that I was talking about.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   His name is Yonatan Zungar.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.520]   Oh, I love Yonatan.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.520]   Oh, he is great.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:39.040]   A former Google guy and he is always very thoughtful and intelligent.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.840]   I've, I've, you can read him on medium as well.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.440]   He's really a smart guy.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   Okay.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.040]   I'll find that thread.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.000]   That thread was on March 18th.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.400]   So he tweeted about a little while back, but, but yeah, man, what a, what a great tweet
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   thread.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.200]   I had thought he left Google.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:05.480]   I think he's still there, but he's a distinguished engineer working on the privacy team at Google.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.480]   How about, how about that?
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.360]   That's great.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:17.040]   You, you mentioned how there are some people who make the argument that that a city needed
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.360]   to be destroyed or a place needed to save lives.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   In order to save lives.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.840]   And you know, I think that we've sort of brought that up in a very different way, of
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:32.520]   course, because having a congressman's credit card revealed is not the same thing as dropping
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520]   atomic bomb.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:40.520]   But in the sense that it does seem like any of these sort of big, these, these things
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.880]   that we maybe don't, don't do enough thinking about.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.320]   We do have to have these atomic bomb style realizations that take place, these rock bottom
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.840]   moments in order for these things to, to, to actually happen for the changes to take place
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   that need to take place.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   And so I don't, I don't know if we've gotten there yet.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.640]   I think Facebook feels like it has maybe, and while they're going through this whole
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.040]   Cambridge Analytica thing.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.320]   And I am interested to see how Facebook continues to hopefully hold to the promises that it
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.800]   is made thus far and how that might affect other companies that are, you know, Twitter,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.720]   Google, et cetera.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.480]   So we've got, you know, GDPR and then this whole Facebook saga all happening at once.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.440]   And maybe we're sort of moving through that period right now where we're going to see
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.840]   the changes take place.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:37.440]   I think that's an excellent point, Micah, because you can argue about the merits of,
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.320]   say, dropping an atomic bomb endlessly.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.240]   The point at this point, having had it happened is what lesson can we learn from it?
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.520]   And where do we do going forward?
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:54.040]   You could argue about Facebook's privacy, invasions in Cambridge Analytica and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   That's done.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.760]   That's water under the bridge.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.960]   What lessons do we learn and what can we do going forward to make it right?
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.800]   I think that's a very good, very good attitude.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.000]   And actually, it is interestingly the attitude of the residents, the current residents of
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.400]   Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.080]   That's really their focus is not ascribing blame or guilt on either side because there's
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.200]   plenty on both sides.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.960]   But really saying let's not have this happen again and turn our backs on the line and so
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   forth.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   Isn't that that's a big thing to say.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.600]   Let's take a little bit of a break.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.840]   We got more coming up with a great panel.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.360]   Ashley, you're doing a podcast.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.520]   What's it called streaming?
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.320]   Tell me about this new thing.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.120]   Oh, I got a new show.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.120]   I just launched it.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.720]   It's called stream economy.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   Stream economy.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   That's it.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.080]   And it's a really fun, you can see that's YouTube page only.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.800]   And it's really fun.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.320]   We basically kind of did a little bit of a riff on mad money.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.560]   So it's all handheld and I have a bunch of props.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.240]   I'll turn off the sound and play a little video.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   This is cute.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240]   This is our promo.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   This is so cute.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.040]   Oh, maybe I'll leave the sound on then.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.160]   I'm Ashley Skeva and your time is money.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.280]   But how do you spend it when there's so much to watch binge and play?
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.800]   Well, that's what I'm here for.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.280]   We're going to talk about what's happening in film, TV, and gaming.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.080]   And I'm going to let you know whether you should buy or feel a fan investment.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   Stream economy.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   That's awesome.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.320]   It's just a great thing.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320]   Congratulations.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   Thanks.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:30.720]   We invest so much in TV and movies and all of these different pop culture things.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.680]   And I really love the subreddit meme economy.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.480]   And so I was like, well, what if we had a show that was like, it was like money.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.760]   We traded our investment like a commodity.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.720]   And we would say, buy into Westworld or sell Walking Dead.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.080]   And so yeah, we treated a little bit like a finance show, but it's for your fan investments
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.120]   and across pop culture.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   And it's really fun.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   I had the very first episode.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.600]   I took a pie to the face.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   Okay.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   And the only right.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600]   It's only right.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   And then this last episode, we snuck around at Disneyland and I tried to get into Galaxy's
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.880]   Edge, which I did not do, but it was really fun.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.800]   And we did some Star Wars day stuff.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   So yeah, it's a really fun show.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.560]   It's like 10 minutes long every Friday.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.040]   And I'm having a really fun time making it.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.880]   We got a bunch of podcasters here.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   Mike is Sergeant.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.720]   You're doing integrate, right?
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   Well, that was that's that one's out.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.720]   Is that gone?
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.720]   What is your current?
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720]   You're still.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720]   It is my.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.720]   Lucid.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   That's the one.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   Yes.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   It's a dream interpretation and sleep science podcast.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.080]   We have listeners send in their dreams.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.160]   We interpret them on the show.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.120]   It's a mixture of comedy and everything you need to know about sleep and everything that
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.480]   surrounds sleep and how important it is.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.760]   Follow him at Chihuahua.coffee.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   Yes.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   That sounds awesome.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.760]   I'm going to listen to that.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   I know.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.760]   I want to do.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.760]   Are you are you a lucid dreamer, Micah?
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.960]   Can you do it?
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.480]   You know, I've been able to do it, but it's not one of those things.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:01.400]   I think people who are true lucid dreamers, if they say that, if they have the badge in
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.360]   the membership card, it's that they can make it happen anytime.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   Right.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.000]   They've had it happen in the past.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.920]   But yeah, I mean, that's where you kind of you're having a dream and you realize you're
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.280]   having a dream and then you have some control over that.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.560]   Yes, you get some level of autonomy and people, you know, report different levels of it.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.320]   But yeah, send in your dreams.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.600]   If you have them and we'd love to interpret them on the show.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.240]   We always have a good time of sort of mixing some funnier, more ridiculous interpretations
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.440]   and then, you know, the real thoughts that we might have for you.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.760]   And Pruitt also here from Tech Republic.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   What's your podcast?
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.040]   I always feel so inadequate.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.280]   I know you need to get a podcast and come on.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.480]   Although AMP creates plenty of content.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:46.000]   If you go to antpruett.com, he's a great photographer, a master of the drone and a
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.800]   Clemson fan.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:54.120]   I've been doing more live streams on Friday nights because people want to watch another
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.040]   dude edit photos, apparently.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   Oh, I do.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.880]   Oh, I need to watch this.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   Actually.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.680]   That sounds really cool.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.360]   You're relaxing.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360]   You know, I come back.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.920]   I have 3000 photos from Japan and I've done.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920]   I don't want to look at them.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.040]   I don't want to edit them, but I know there's no one will ever see them if I don't.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.680]   So I need help.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.040]   I started doing some live streams here within the last month and it's been fun.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.200]   Not necessarily just photos.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   I've done.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:29.120]   I want to say I did one video tutorial where I took a scene and made it a tilt shift scene
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.560]   from my drone.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.560]   Oh, that's.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   Oh, that sounds cool.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.560]   YouTube.com/antprutt.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.200]   That's me.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.720]   And you do now the Friday night live.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.280]   That's already ended up.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.280]   Party ended up.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.280]   Nice.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.280]   I love that.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   Cool.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280]   See all that you don't.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.160]   You're not an underachiever, Ant.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.280]   You just getting started.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.280]   That's all.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:03.760]   All right, show today brought to you by a guy in a strange tie and my mattress.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.120]   Let me tell you, coming home last night, knowing my casper awaits.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.160]   It didn't take me long to fall asleep, but it probably wouldn't.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.640]   I could have been sleeping on a rock.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.880]   It wouldn't take me long to fall asleep, but it was so nice.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.120]   After when you travel and you sleep on a lot of different mattresses to get back to the
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.920]   casper, the casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.200]   I don't even care that they're a fraction of the costs, but they are.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.280]   They're revolutionizing the mattress industry and they know how they get the cost down,
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.000]   not by making a cheaper mattress.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.600]   No, it's a premium mattress.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:40.360]   It's a fantastic mattress by eliminating the middleman.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360]   No more resellers.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.000]   No more showrooms.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.800]   You save great prices on amazing mattresses, the original casper.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.320]   That's the one we've got as a combined multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.520]   that has what Lisa says is soft and hard.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.480]   Just the right sink, so you get on it and you feel like, "Oh, I'm sinking into a cloud."
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.800]   Then it's firm.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   Just the right bounce.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.480]   It's hard to describe until you try it, and it's breathable.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.480]   You're never hot.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.880]   You sleep cool, and it helps you regulate your temperature through the night.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.440]   These are things you need, something that gives where it's supposed to and holds you
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.840]   where it's supposed to and keeps you cool.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.000]   By the way, you can buy it online easily and completely risk free because Casper knows
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.400]   without a showroom, you're going to say, "Well, how do I know which Casper to get?
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.600]   How do I know if I'm going to like it?"
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.040]   Well, you have 100 days to try it out.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.440]   Or should I say 100 nights?
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.400]   Free delivery, painless returns within 100-day period.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.080]   If you don't like your Casper for any reason in the first 100 days, you call them.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.280]   They'll come and get it and refund you every penny.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.840]   Casper mattress is, of course, uphold the highest environmental production standards.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.840]   Actually, that's one thing I know about Casper because other mattresses I've had to air out
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.800]   for days or weeks before I even wanted to sleep on them.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.080]   They smelled funny.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.720]   The Casper comes out of the box, fresh as a daisy.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.680]   I know they're doing something right.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:07.080]   They're made in the USA, but you get free shipping and returns in the US, Canada, and
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080]   the UK.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.400]   Get that Casper today.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.760]   I'm telling you, it makes coming home.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.640]   As hard as it is coming back from vacation, it makes it okay.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.360]   I know my Casper awaits.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.720]   Get $50 towards select mattresses right now if you go to Casper.com/twit and use the promo
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.080]   code TWIT at checkout.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.440]   That's Casper.com/twit.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:34.000]   Promo code TWIT to say $50 on select mattresses, terms, and conditions apply.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   Casper...
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.880]   I just say, I don't know what happened this week.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:46.000]   I wasn't here, but I think they made a cheap video for me.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.240]   So I could see what I missed this week on TWIT Watch.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.360]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.640]   Alex Lindsay, let's start with you.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.640]   What is your pick of the week?
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.960]   So I'm doing an anti-pick.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.720]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.480]   Years ago, I recommended the NPR app.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:09.080]   NPR updated the app, and it is the stupidest idea that I've ever seen anybody do to their
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   own app.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.440]   I'm never giving them money again.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.280]   Like until they put the playlist back, they will never get money from me again.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   All about Android.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.720]   Heading back to Android P really quick before we move on, Material Design 2, we know we're
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.280]   going to see a lot about that.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.120]   We're already kind of starting to see that.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:32.240]   Gestures, also something called Assistant Slice's API, which apparently is surfacing app content
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   outside of the app itself.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   Sounds hot.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.200]   I don't know what else to say.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   That sounds great.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.200]   I'm excited.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.200]   I'm sure that sounds hot.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.640]   I get really excited about this job.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.680]   It's like, it's like, it's being dating.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.800]   It's like, Android is kind of like speed dating.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   Yes, it is.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   The new screensabers.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:55.640]   Remember all the mistakes you watched your friends make in high school?
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.760]   Trying to date people through Facebook?
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.720]   Facebook's decided to make it official.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.320]   Facebook is going to do dating.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.560]   Just give us your most deep, your deepest, darkest sexual interest, and we'll hook you
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   up with people that you want.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.520]   I don't know if it sounds really good.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:14.240]   And a priest says that, especially after Facebook's news in the last couple of weeks,
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.480]   just imagine the wonderful conversations Mr. Zuckerberg will be happy with Congress
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.800]   in just a few months.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.880]   Twitter, bring your brain.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.680]   We'll do the rest.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.280]   They held down the fort without me.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280]   Nice job.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.960]   Thank you, Patrick and Robert.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:34.400]   And by the way, Alex Lindsey on Tuesday complained about the NPR app on Wednesday NPR bought pocket
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.800]   casts, which kind of surprised me.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.560]   That's the number two app people listen to Twit with, by the way.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560]   It's very big.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.320]   It is pocket cast.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.960]   I love it.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.600]   iOS, Android, Shifty Jelly out of Australia.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.760]   Everybody uses it.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.520]   Well, I guess NPR realized that.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.840]   It makes me a little nervous.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.520]   As always, the Shifty Jelly folks during an acquisition, people always say, oh, nothing's
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.520]   going to change.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.720]   We're going to keep the same app.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.760]   But you got to think that there's a reason.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   It was purchased actually not just by NPR, but by a coalition of NPR, WNYC, WBEZ Chicago
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.560]   in this American life.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:21.360]   And I guess the question, it's great if they just put money into it and make it better
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.360]   and better, but you got to think it's going to become an NPR app, not a general podcast
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.920]   app, or at least favor NPR.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:33.720]   Yeah, I think that's certainly interesting sort of assessing Russell Ivanovich.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.320]   He's one of the co-founders of Shifty Jelly.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.640]   He's a pretty good friend of mine.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:45.280]   And talking to him sort of about the rollout of this and how people have responded to it,
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.520]   he put together the FAQ on their site.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.600]   I think he did a really good job of sort of mixing humor and hopefully getting people
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.920]   a little chill about everything as we figure it all out.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.680]   And it's my understanding that they are being as true as they possibly can be too.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.160]   What that FAQ says, which is that things are not changing as they are.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.920]   And of course, over time, there will come changes, but it's important for them to sort
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.680]   of hold on to that base and that this is more of an opportunity to, you know, we're
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:24.360]   seeing, continuing to see sort of the podcast industry as it continues to kind of leach
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   into these other sort of start-up-y and big-money opportunities.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.960]   We're seeing kind of the base fallaway, which is networks like Twit and smaller networks
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:44.520]   like Relay FM and these people who are genuinely at the forefront of podcasting who are down
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.360]   in the trenches doing it themselves and that openness, that open nature that anyone can
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.000]   go online and start a podcast at any time.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.280]   I know is very, very, very important to Russell and the rest of the team.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:03.160]   And that is something that NPR thinks sees is like, let's keep this an open field and
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:09.360]   not have these sort of siloed-off places where you have ads automatically filtered in and
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:14.000]   all the other stuff that can come with some of these different big companies kind of trying
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.120]   to take over the podcast industry.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.960]   And I agree with Russell and Philip and Chris and the team, but with all due respect, they're
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.200]   not going to have a choice.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.520]   The company's been purchased.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.960]   So I understand they're honorable intentions, but I can guarantee you NPR did not buy pocket
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.760]   cast to leave it exactly as it makes no sense at all.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   And of course, they're going to start putting stuff in there.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   I don't know what.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.960]   That's the question.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.440]   You know, the good news is just as podcasts are open, so are apps.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.560]   And if I were somebody like Marco Arman, who makes overcast, I would just say, well, here's
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.640]   an opportunity.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.640]   I think we need independent.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.680]   See, I think here's what I think is happening because Apple did this thing with iTunes now
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.800]   where they offer metrics to podcasters because really what's really happening, in my opinion,
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.520]   and I know a little bit about this is that advertisers want to know more about you.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.600]   Oh, surprise surprise.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:14.040]   What's the biggest threat to podcasting Google and Facebook because they sell your information
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.040]   to these companies?
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.040]   We don't.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   We don't know anything about you.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.600]   We don't want to know anything about you.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.440]   We do a niche podcast and the point of it is we can say, well, anybody would listen to
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.320]   any of our shows or tech enthusiasts.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   So that's what you're buying.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.640]   And that's all we tell them.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.280]   We do a survey, a voluntary survey once a year that gives us some more information, but
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.560]   it's voluntary itself selecting.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.480]   We don't consider it statistically important and we don't collect information in any other
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.160]   way, but advertisers want that.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.440]   And so Apple with iTunes is now doing that.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.000]   And if you use the good news is nobody uses iTunes to listen.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.160]   But what I think advertisers would love and I know NPR would love is an app that reports
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.560]   back on you that tells them what you're doing, what you're listening to, how often, how long,
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.240]   what you subscribe to, where you are when you subscribe and more and more.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.640]   And so, you know, I'm sure Russell does not like this idea, but I also know that Russell
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.160]   got a check and then NPR now owns it.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:20.840]   It'll be interesting seeing how this all shakes out and what I think this coalition is after
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:26.400]   versus like you said, these, you know, in individual apps that still exist at the spot.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   You know what they're after.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.600]   We know what they're after.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.600]   And I hope that Russell got a nice big check.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.600]   I do.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600]   And I think they've done a great job.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.040]   I love pocket casts.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.680]   And as long as it continues to remain pocket cast, I'll continue to use it.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.200]   It is my also my choice for a podcast player.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:47.320]   But the minute advertisers start using it or, or, or, broadcasters start using it, because
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.120]   I know I'll get an email in six months or a year saying, Hey, would you like to buy the,
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.320]   the, would you, you know, would you like to use pot?
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.520]   We want you to encourage you to tell all your listeners use pocket casts.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.120]   And by the way, we'll share those insights back with you just as Apple has done.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.560]   Of course.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:07.200]   So, and what I would urge people to do is to continue to use podcast apps that don't spy
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   on you.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.040]   And as long as pocket cast is one of them, it's a good one to keep using.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.140]   I love it.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:12.420]   I think it's a, it's a great app.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.880]   And I'm glad that they did well.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.880]   Philip and Russell.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.240]   I think I'm the only person that doesn't use, use that app for podcasts and either use Google
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:26.680]   Play or I'll use my friends, play a pod app.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.720]   I think you met Todd Moore.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   I did.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   Sometimes.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.720]   He made it.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720]   He made a podcast and app and I've been using his.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.720]   Nice.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.360]   But I just, I never really think about other apps because I like listening to Google Play
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.500]   from my music as well and it's all just, you know, right there.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.820]   I think mostly what's going to end up happening is that people don't, won't even download
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820]   shows anymore.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.180]   They'll just stream them.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.900]   And I look at people using Echo and other devices like Echo to listen.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.500]   And that's a great way to listen to shows.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.900]   Now of course, I'm sure Google and Amazon are both collecting information if you use
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.500]   their voice assistants, but it's not the same kind.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:08.340]   I mean, listening on HomePod is not a great experience for those of us who don't want
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.560]   to use the Apple podcasts.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.660]   Oh, oh, sorry.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.700]   Is she a Greyhound?
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.700]   What is she?
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.500]   Yeah, this is Fylo.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.160]   He's an Italian Greyhound.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.520]   Was he a rescue?
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   No.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.520]   No.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.440]   He's a sweetheart.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.760]   He came from a fancy place in Iowa.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   An Italian Greyhound.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   He's about a year old.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.320]   He's as big as he gets.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.240]   They're smaller than regular Greyhounds.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   He's small.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.620]   And then we're going to be doing pets because I would be on there with both of my dogs and
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.580]   we'll just have Ashley on of course.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.940]   And we just have to have everybody on there and we can all have our pets.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.320]   I told you I went in Japan.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.820]   I went to all the different pet cafes.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:51.580]   There's a cat cafe, a dog cafe, a hedgehog cafe.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.580]   That's incredible.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.580]   Now we'll have a cat.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:54.580]   You can't pitch that.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.100]   I can't believe there's a hedgehog cafe.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.260]   You can't catch the hedgehogs.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.340]   There's prickly.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.700]   So you just have to look at them.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:06.180]   I don't know if it was a mike or a aunt who said, you know, that's probably because pet
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.000]   ownership in Japan is difficult.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   It's true.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.120]   And so if you can't have a pet in your apartment, well, at least you can go to the cafe and
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   snuggle.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   No.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.320]   Apparently for a lot of money, didn't you say it costs to pet them?
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.320]   It wasn't that much.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.960]   It wasn't as expensive as some.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   I have the price somewhere.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   If you're.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.560]   What costs more of the coffee or petting the hand?
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.720]   You don't go there for the drinks.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.960]   You can get them and then you get one free drink with admission.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   You go for the cats.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.220]   You go for the cats.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.300]   Let me see if I can.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300]   I took a picture.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.580]   Is that like a comedy club where it's like you could really you're there to buy a couple
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.140]   of you got to buy a couple of drinks?
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140]   It's true to cat minimum.
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140]   And you get okay.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.140]   Two pet minimum.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.140]   Two pet minimum.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:51.140]   That's actually a good idea.
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.740]   They ought to do that.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.220]   It wasn't very wasn't very expensive.
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:00.220]   And you get a deal if you buy all three or something like that.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.780]   I can't remember.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:03.780]   We bought the day pass.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:06.400]   I like the idea.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:12.040]   If you have like a mark on your hand and so if you leave the pet you go.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.040]   I'm still back.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   I get to come back.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   It's a Hello Kitty stamp.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   Hey, speak.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.780]   We were talking about Apple supply chain analysts.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:25.880]   This one I didn't notice this, but me Chingquo has left.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:31.300]   Ming Chingquo is the securities analyst KGI securities who seems to have the inside track
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.500]   on Apple stuff.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.780]   He's left.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:37.980]   He is no longer KGI left on Friday, according to the China time.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.340]   So I don't know what he's going to do.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:46.460]   Mark Gurman who knows everything says he's reportedly moving on to cover innovative non-Apple
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:47.460]   companies.
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.220]   I'm sure there's a party going on an Apple Apple.
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:55.300]   Apple of course remember a couple of weeks before I left released a memo to its staff
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.820]   saying don't leak.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:59.940]   The memo was immediately leaked to Mark Gurman.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.060]   I think now I'm of the opinion it was leaked to Mark Gurman by Apple because it turns out
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:10.340]   that all of the incidents of leaks mentioned in the memo were leaks to Mark Gurman.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.900]   Oh, it was.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:19.940]   I think now reading the between the lines, you know, employees have been fired for doing
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.780]   this and that yeah, fired for leaking that information to Mark Gurman.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.580]   I think they leaked the memo to Mark Gurman to say, you see what happens.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.380]   You see what happens when you get calls.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.380]   Don't liquid you.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.380]   The irony.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.540]   Yeah, the irony of it.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.340]   Anyway, I'm sure Apple's happy about that.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:42.180]   Speaking of leaks, you know, Apple's WWDC is coming up.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:46.980]   I think a lot of people are waiting to buy Mac stuff hoping that Apple will announce especially
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.500]   new Mac books in June.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.500]   According to.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.260]   I hate that keyboard, man.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.260]   Oh, yes.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.580]   Do you like it Ashley?
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.580]   I don't have it.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:00.860]   I am clinging to my 2013 retina.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.260]   As you should.
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.260]   Amen.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.980]   With all of my might, I won't get rid of it.
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:06.980]   I won't upgrade it.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:10.260]   I'm just I mean, you can pry it out of my cold dead hands.
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:15.620]   I took to Japan and I have many choices, including a number of think pads.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:20.620]   I took my 2015 MacBook Pro, the last great MacBook Pro.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.300]   That's the one I have and I love it so much.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.300]   And it's still fast enough.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.300]   So good.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.180]   I use it right now.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.780]   Yeah, I dread the day when it fails because I don't even want to think about that.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.860]   Yeah, what do you talk about fail will be forever forever.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:41.660]   Well, according to Benjamin Mayo and nine to five Mac, don't look for a release of a
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:45.780]   new MacBook at WWDC.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:50.380]   Supply chain partners stuck with piling inventories of parts until I book gives the go ahead.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.100]   Actually, this comes from digitizing.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.780]   Piling inventories of keyboards.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.780]   Keyboards.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780]   I'm sure he wants.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.700]   I can just have a big giant warehouse of these keyboards.
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:00.900]   Another acquisition news.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.100]   So much courage though, Elio.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   So much courage.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.860]   Well, in those keyboards, they fail it out.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.180]   The new ones fail at a higher rate.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.180]   They're hard to fix.
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.540]   If you get a crumb under there, there's no way to get it out.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:15.860]   Yeah, what was the market research for these types of keyboards because Apple isn't they're
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.860]   not the only company.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.060]   Oh, you're seeing them everywhere now.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.140]   That's why I own two Lenovo's because they still make that not as good as they used to
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:28.380]   be, but still better than anybody else with high travel.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:29.380]   Nice feeling.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.260]   That T series is great.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.260]   I know.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.260]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:36.420]   I just wish it ran Mac OS.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.580]   I mean, Windows is fine.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.060]   I feel that they've had a lot of things.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.060]   Yeah, I just wish it ran Mac OS.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.340]   I see a lot of people getting those clicky keyboards.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.340]   You have one, Leo?
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.340]   Yep.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:47.980]   I have a DOS keyboard.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:53.620]   I use that on my iMac Pro at home and I have the WASM code keyboard.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:55.620]   I use it work, which I love.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.820]   I got my razor promo.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.820]   Is it a chair?
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.820]   Yeah, it's Cherry MX baby.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.180]   I recognize the Cherry sound.
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.980]   It's Cherry MX, which is nice.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:07.380]   I've been using it every time I tie it into the chat room.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.780]   Sounds like a Cherry Red.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:09.740]   Yeah, it's very clickety.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.380]   You can't.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:14.060]   I got the Cherry Brown, which is supposedly silent.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.140]   That's like saying a silencer on a gun is silent.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.900]   And isn't at all.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.900]   Quieter.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:22.900]   Quieter.
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:23.900]   I like that.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.220]   Have you fired a gun with a silencer?
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.220]   Do you know?
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:29.620]   Well, so my dad is like he hunts and stuff.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.460]   And so I've been to the shooting range a few times and I got to use a silencer one time
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.500]   a long time ago, like 10 years ago.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.300]   And I thought it was going to be quiet and it was not.
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.300]   Oh, wow.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.420]   This is very surprised by that.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:44.860]   No one told me everybody thought it was the most hilarious things.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.460]   I was really scared that it allowed noise.
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:50.140]   Does it make a boom or?
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.140]   It's not.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.140]   It's allowed.
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:53.140]   And it's allowed noise.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.660]   It's not like in the James Bond films.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.660]   It's not just.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.660]   No, it's not like that.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.660]   Choo, choo.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:58.660]   No, that is.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:01.900]   That's what I was expecting and I was very incorrect.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:02.900]   Wow.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:03.900]   God.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.460]   At least my wife won't let me get a gun.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:08.740]   My wife has a number of guns.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   Won't let me get a gun.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.700]   She's afraid of what I would do with that.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:14.100]   You don't need it.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   Is she?
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:16.660]   Yeah, you got Lisa protecting you.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.340]   Here's a silencer on a red.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.340]   Five rounds.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.340]   Unsuppressed.
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.820]   That's without the silencer.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.820]   Let's jump ahead.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:32.020]   Everyone in the chat room is screaming suppressor suppressor not silencer.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:35.380]   Yeah, it sounds the same.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.820]   It's still loud.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.820]   It's still allowed.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:48.860]   So you can't really go around like just shooting people with impunity.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:52.460]   I guess I'm happy about that.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.180]   I'm kind of happy about that.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.180]   It should be loud.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:00.540]   It's just like, are you always seeing in the movies that I'm like?
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:07.700]   It's a convenient fiction for movies because you need a way to shoot somebody quietly.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.820]   So the guy in the next room.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:16.940]   So talking about Apple and acquisitions, Apple of course bought Texture, which is a sponsor.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.940]   Well they were.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.380]   I think we just got a message that they don't want to buy anymore.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.860]   What a surprise.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:26.460]   The rumor was they were going to fold Texture into their news app and maybe this is starting
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.460]   to happen.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.540]   They just shut down Texture's Windows app.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:37.420]   Still on iOS, still available for your iPad, but not for Windows.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:42.060]   The Android app, the Amazon Fire app and the ISO iOS apps will still be supported.
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:47.580]   But you have to think Apple is basically going to fade that out and do something else.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.980]   I can't imagine they'll keep that fire app for longer than...
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   You know what?
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.980]   I use Texture.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:56.860]   Texture we should tell people who haven't seen our million ads for them is kind of like
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.860]   Netflix for magazines.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:59.220]   You pay $10 bucks a month.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.380]   You get 200 magazines.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.700]   It was created by the magazines.
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:06.660]   Conde, Nast, and Hearst and I think Meredith because it was a great way for them to distribute
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:07.660]   magazines digitally.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.660]   They were all in on it.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.300]   We bought them recently, we think for around $100 million.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.460]   I'm not sure exactly what Apple gets.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.820]   I don't think it's the app they're looking for, but it ran great on the fire.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:24.340]   I made a fire, a really useful little magazine reading tool.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:25.340]   I don't know.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:29.580]   I think I seem to remember, I probably shouldn't say anything, but I think that they said,
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.340]   "Yeah, we're done with advertisements."
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:34.180]   I think they said that, but I'm not sure.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.820]   If you hear another Texture ad, then I'm wrong.
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.820]   And that's good news.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.820]   You're doing something right.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:40.820]   You still hear another ad.
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:45.500]   Well, I don't know, but I really think that the Texture, they always said, "Oh man, we
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.700]   get a lot of subscriptions from Twit listeners."
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:52.740]   I think we were very helpful for them as we are for all of our advertisers.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.220]   There you go.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.260]   Google I/O is this week.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.220]   Any expectations?
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.300]   Anybody excited about, will they announce a new phone?
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.300]   I don't think so.
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.300]   Maybe a Chromebook?
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.300]   I don't know.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:09.420]   We'll hear more about Android P, of course, the next version of Android.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:14.180]   That's what Jason Howell was talking about and all about Android.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.140]   I'm interested.
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:23.900]   While I was gone, Amazon announced a way for end users to program their Echo.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:24.900]   Okay.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:25.900]   Right?
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.900]   What was that called?
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:27.900]   Yeah, new.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:28.900]   It's...
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.900]   It has a funny name.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:33.500]   This is the new skills thing that they did.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.500]   It's...
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.500]   Hold on a second.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:40.540]   I was looking at this because I think this is terribly fascinating where you can now
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:45.780]   do a whole bunch of custom DIY skills for Alexa and...
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.940]   Luke, Luke print.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:47.940]   That's right.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:48.940]   Luke, the earbud.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:49.940]   Luke, the earbud.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:50.940]   It's like Mad Libs.
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:55.420]   He put in all of the information you want it to do and then it just builds you a little
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:56.420]   skill.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.420]   It's pretty cool.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.420]   They had it.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.420]   They had it.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.420]   I mean, what I have to think is that Google's going to have a response.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:04.420]   Right?
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.420]   I think it's...
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.420]   It's blueprints.amazon.com.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.820]   Let me play one for you just to give you an idea.
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.100]   This is the website.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:15.060]   Create personal skills for your Echo.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:17.260]   I won't say the A word in minutes.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:22.700]   They've got one for Mother's Day called All About Mom.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:23.700]   Surprise.
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.700]   This is...
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.700]   Okay.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.700]   I think this might be a little creepy, but here you go.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.260]   Surprise Mom with a personalized story.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:31.380]   You want to hear a sample?
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.620]   You're going to hear the A word here.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620]   I'll just say, we'll just bloop it out.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.620]   Hi, Scarlett.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:37.620]   Open my mom's story.
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:38.620]   So...
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.420]   Don't be Mother's Day.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:47.140]   Jack and Olivia created this story, which is all about their mom's era.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:50.140]   Sarah was born in Washington a really long time ago.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:52.700]   Growing up, she loved to play soccer.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   Shady.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:57.900]   These days, Sarah's favorite things to do are play tennis and spend time with her family
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.300]   and dog Coco.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:04.740]   Her favorite food is spaghetti with meatballs and her favorite color is green.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.740]   Really?
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:07.740]   Olivia and Jack loved their mom.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.740]   Really?
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.580]   That's your Mother's Day gift.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:13.340]   If I were their mom, I'd go, "No."
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.340]   So this...
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:15.340]   What is he doing?
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:16.340]   Back to the drawing board.
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:18.020]   Where is the rest of it?
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.020]   Yes.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.020]   Where's the cash?
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.020]   Where's the envelope?
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:26.820]   My favorite one is the Burns one, where you can create a roast for friends.
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:30.580]   And it just feels really funny.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.580]   You again?
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.860]   Well, as long as you're here, you're my favorite person besides every other person I've ever
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:36.860]   met.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:38.660]   Want more of the truth?
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.660]   Yes.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.140]   It's a terrible bird.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.460]   You outgrinch the Grinch.
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.460]   Still feeling good about yourself?
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.460]   Say "bring it" to hear more.
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.460]   Bring it.
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:49.460]   Bring it.
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:50.460]   You're really funny.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:51.460]   Looking.
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.460]   That is...
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.460]   Oh, Lord.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.460]   So...
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.460]   The lizard was a little more to his eyes.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:59.660]   But that's the point is that you can customize it.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.860]   And there is one or two that might be useful.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:08.220]   For instance, you can make a custom one for the babysitter or a pet sitter or a house
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:09.220]   sketch.
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.220]   Yes.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.020]   So here's one for a babysitter.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.020]   Open my babysitter.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.740]   Hello, and thanks for all your help today.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:21.740]   This is your custom guide to caring for the little one.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.980]   If you have any questions, just ask.
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:29.380]   You can ask about schedules, allergies, medicines, how things work.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.380]   And so the parent would fill all this in, obviously.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.380]   The emergency's gonna write this down.
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:35.700]   It's gonna just put it on a piece of paper on the fridge like any other human.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.700]   Right.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:37.700]   Or text me.
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:38.700]   I don't know.
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:40.700]   You can have one for a house guest.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.700]   It's gonna get so long.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.100]   It's the problem, right?
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:46.900]   You can have one for a house guest that says how to turn on the TV.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:47.900]   Oh, my Lord.
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:53.940]   Why don't we just stay home and help because of yourself?
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:56.020]   But I like the idea.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.220]   I'm of late.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:01.620]   I've come to a somewhat skeptical point of view, which everybody I know tries to talk
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   me out of, that there is no such thing as artificial intelligence.
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:09.460]   That everything we've seen to there will be, but everything we've seen to this date is
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:13.900]   exactly the same as every computer program you ever used before.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:18.500]   It's merely somebody writing down what to do when.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:19.740]   And that's all this is.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:25.500]   You're trying to make out like echo is some sort of magical assistant, but it isn't.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500]   It's just, you know, a bunch of stuff.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.940]   Doing all the legwork.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.940]   It's been pre-programmed.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:32.620]   You'd be better off just putting it on a piece of paper.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.620]   Amen.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:36.980]   AI is merely at this point of marketing term.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:42.020]   Someday I know the world will change, but at this point, you see in everybody say, well,
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.020]   here you go.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.660]   Why there's artificial intelligence built in.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:47.660]   Oh, it's a computer program.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:50.060]   Get me a break.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:51.540]   I agree with you.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.540]   I agree with you.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:53.540]   I agree with you.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.660]   I, you know, you can try to talk me out of it.
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:46:00.140]   I'm not, I'm not dead set on it, but if you use the new Gmail, I, this happened while
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.140]   I was gone.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.140]   Do you like it?
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.140]   Do you care?
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.140]   Does anybody care?
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.140]   Does anybody, let me ask you this.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.300]   I haven't gotten a rollout yet.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.940]   Who you, oh, you can do it.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940]   And here's what you do.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.580]   No, no, no, I'm just going to wait on them.
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:13.580]   I'm not going to force it.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:14.900]   No, no forcing involved.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:20.020]   But if you, if you, if you, if you go to your Gmail account and you click on the gear here,
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.340]   I'll do it right now.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.580]   So I'm on my Gmail account.
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:23.580]   Sorry, you could show this.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.900]   There's nothing in it.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:29.660]   And I said, and the gear, it says right there, try the new Gmail, try the new Gmail.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.820]   And so I'm not sure exactly what's new.
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:35.940]   Well, on the right side, it's got like your to do list.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:38.580]   Oh, this is the new Google task.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.100]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.100]   Okay.
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.740]   Here's Google Keep.
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:44.740]   Here's my calendar.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.740]   Okay.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.740]   That's cool.
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.740]   Like that's nice.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.740]   Okay.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.380]   I like that the calendar access is select.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:53.660]   It doesn't have it has artificial intelligence.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.660]   Right.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:58.100]   But I think the problem is it doesn't have shared calendars.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.500]   Like it's only your like, I think it's only yours.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.740]   I might be wrong on that.
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:07.220]   You're out of storage space and soon will be unable to send or receive emails.
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:08.860]   What the hell?
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:09.860]   That's part of the new.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.100]   That's a feature, a new feature.
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.100]   Time to pay that drive.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.100]   Wow.
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.100]   Not nice.
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.980]   Not nice Google.
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:20.460]   Anyway, that's the that's the new Gmail.
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:21.460]   What else happened?
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.460]   Oh, Twitter.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.860]   Let's talk about Twitter.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:27.620]   Log into your Twitter account and you'll get a little warning or maybe you'll see it
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:32.460]   on your email saying, oops, actually it doesn't say oops.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.820]   It should start with oops.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.220]   It should start with oops.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.220]   It doesn't.
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:37.980]   It should say oopsie.
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.820]   So Twitter did the right thing.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.940]   Everybody does this.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.980]   They encrypted your passwords.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:47.060]   When you create a password to your Twitter account, they even salted and hashed it, which
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.940]   sounds like something for breakfast.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.940]   Delicious.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:48:02.660]   But they also kept a log as they did this of every user and their password in plain text.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:03.900]   So it's Twitter.
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:10.420]   Now, Twitter is quick to say as far as we know, nobody's downloaded this log.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:13.500]   But anybody who ever worked at Twitter probably had access to it.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.900]   I'm guessing a few people who used to work at Twitter have a USB drive with some passwords
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:18.900]   on it.
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:19.900]   Anyway, take this as warning.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.900]   You should change your password.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:23.540]   I didn't worry too much, even though I was overseas.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:27.020]   I couldn't change it very easily because I knew I had two factor turned on and that would
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.220]   probably be a good idea.
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:32.820]   Although, for all we know, right next to the password and the Excel spreadsheet with everybody's
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.780]   passwords right next to it is the secret number that is the authenticator.
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:38.620]   So like your backup code or whatever.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:41.740]   That's one of the main things.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:46.260]   Like everybody who's going through right now and updating your Twitter password, if you
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:49.980]   don't have two factor authentication turned on, go ahead and get that turned on.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:56.700]   And please, if you can, to the best of your ability, try and get a two factor authentication
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.500]   app, an app that will actually generate the code for you.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:00.940]   Don't do the text messages.
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:01.940]   Yes.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:07.540]   Getting it sent to your phone, we've seen time and time again how people who are very,
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:13.420]   very clever are good at spoofing things like your phone number and doing social engineering
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:16.940]   against carriers to be able to get access to those codes.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:23.540]   And so it ends up not doing you a good service, especially because companies treat these two
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:29.180]   factor codes as sort of a sacred form of being able to tell that it's you.
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.180]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:34.940]   And so it's important like once someone has that, then they can do a good job of pretending
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:37.940]   that they're you and companies are like, oh, yeah, must be you.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.900]   Let's let you have access to everything.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.940]   So get that turned on.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:49.060]   And by the way, if you reuse passwords to factor eight, it'll only help you with Twitter.
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.020]   And so that's another thing not to do.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:52.100]   Don't reuse passwords.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.780]   If your Twitter passwords used anywhere else, you now have to change that too.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.100]   Don't forget.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.180]   Change it all.
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.700]   So Leo change your cat cafe is my favorite password that you have set up across all your
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:03.700]   accounts.
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:06.900]   That's right.
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:13.060]   I have one password and it gave me a little red message and said, Hey, it's been this
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.460]   is this might be compromised.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.860]   You should change your password right away.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:16.860]   So that was pretty cool.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:17.860]   Yeah.
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:22.140]   If you're using a password vault, you know, the very first thing that does is it lets
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.260]   you have new fresh, very good passwords for every account you set up.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:28.980]   And most of them will have a security check.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:32.860]   I know last pass does where it'll say here's where you reuse passwords.
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:37.660]   It's changed those and it will somewhat help you automate the password change.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:38.660]   I like it.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.660]   It's a little inconvenient when you first set it up and you have to go through everything.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:47.700]   You take a day, set up a password manager, but it's really been.
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.980]   I mean, I would say it's probably one of the most critical things that I use on a daily
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:55.020]   basis that I really feel like me too.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:56.660]   But that's the thing that's funny.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:01.860]   A lot of people won't use those password managers is because of the work that's involved.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:02.860]   But do please.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.860]   Unfortunately.
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:08.020]   And we should mention last pass is a sponsor.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:13.260]   And you know, we certainly encourage people to if not use last pass use use something.
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.020]   There's a lot of good ones out there.
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.020]   I mean, I agree.
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:19.780]   You know, look, I mean, I'd say there's a good handful of them.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.260]   There's plenty to choose from and there's no reason not to.
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:26.140]   And yes, bite the bullet and do a little bit of work because the next time you get one
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.940]   of those emails, it won't be a crisis anymore.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:30.940]   Exactly.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:35.700]   Well, she have 15,000 Twitter accounts and you have to go through and change them.
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:36.700]   I have a lot.
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.900]   I have to actually decide now how much Russian bots, how many times have changed their passwords
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.740]   the other day.
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:50.060]   It was like a just I'd love to see the graph there of sort of how the political spectrum
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.340]   was changed on that day that they had to go through and change all those passwords.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.060]   They were too busy.
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:58.340]   We can't we can't under we can't under my America today.
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:00.340]   We have to change passwords.
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.340]   Maybe it's a conspiracy.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.460]   Does the CIA doing that on purpose?
[01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:05.180]   No more undermining.
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:09.380]   By the way, in a completely unrelated incident, Steve bomber has sold all of his Twitter stock
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:12.140]   every every every bit of it.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.100]   I didn't know he had some.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:16.980]   I guess this is what he does these days in the former CEO of Microsoft.
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:22.780]   Besides owning the LA Clippers, he bought about 4% of Twitter in 2015, which means his
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:24.020]   money is doubled.
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:32.460]   He sold it all.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:36.660]   I still rain bullish about Twitter in the long run, whether it's an acquisition or something
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.660]   else.
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:40.060]   He's happy to be out of it.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.060]   I think that's the case.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:46.820]   Oh, I miss having Steve bomber in the news.
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:50.260]   He was always rather entertaining just to say the least.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:56.460]   Yeah, developers, developers, developers, guys, speaking of developers, not only Google
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:00.460]   IO this week and but oh, I should tell you our schedule because we will be.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:06.660]   So tomorrow, Microsoft's build developers conference starts and we will be covering the
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.500]   build keynote live.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.260]   What time does that start?
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:12.420]   Carson, is that eight tomorrow?
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:16.340]   What eight thirty eight thirty in the morning and I will not be here for that.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.180]   Thank God because I eight thirty in the morning is is like,
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.580]   I don't know what Japan time.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:23.780]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.780]   But Mary Jo, so we will who is going to be hosting the coverage tomorrow?
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:32.140]   That will be Father Robert Ballester and Lisa Schmeiser.
[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.140]   Thank you.
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.300]   That's Carson Bond, the air producer.
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.780]   So Father Robert and Lisa will be here eight thirty tomorrow morning.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.220]   You can watch the keynote and then at three tomorrow afternoon, this is all Pacific time,
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:43.220]   six p.m.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.460]   Eastern Windows weekly because Mary Jo and Paul of course are at build and so they'll have
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.220]   their thoughts on what Microsoft announced.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:56.380]   The next day Google I/O's keynote kicks off things and I will be here for that one at 10
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.380]   a.m.
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:00.420]   Our live coverage begins on Tuesday.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:03.100]   That means we won't be doing iOS today or Mac break weekly on Tuesday.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:08.940]   We're moving those to Wednesday and we're moving this weekend Google to Tuesday right
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:15.780]   after the Google keynote, Jeff Jarvis and Nathan Nathan.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.420]   Jason Howell, I'm getting punched and starting to fade.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:24.580]   Jason Howell will be there covering that and we'll be on Twitter.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.660]   I think some of them will be on Twitter if we can get them to a microphone.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.380]   We're going to try to get Jeff on.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.380]   Stacy will be on.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.380]   Good.
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.380]   And Kevin Tofill.
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.380]   And Mr. T.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.380]   Nice.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.380]   Who actually worked Google briefly.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:39.340]   Is that the greyhound, Italian greyhound?
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:40.340]   No.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.340]   Yeah, I heard about it.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:42.340]   No, they have really deep bark.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:43.340]   Yeah, this sounds like Italian greyhound.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:44.340]   Who is that?
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.340]   Is that Micah?
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.220]   No, it sounded like my dog said it was a dog in my house.
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:49.220]   Here it is.
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:54.380]   One is called Kylo Finn and then there's a tiny chihuahua named Jacks.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.380]   That's who you heard.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:56.380]   Oh, it's a chihuahua Jack.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.380]   I thought it sounded like a chihuahua.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.380]   Do you ever call him "Konichi-wah-wah"?
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.380]   No, no.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.380]   I can't.
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:05.380]   I'll even say this.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:08.380]   Show some of those.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.380]   Show's canceled.
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:10.380]   It's over.
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.380]   I'm going home.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.380]   It's over.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.540]   Alright, let me do one more ad and then we'll wrap things up.
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.620]   There's still a ton of news.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:17.620]   I didn't...
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.420]   Sprint to mobile merging.
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:20.420]   What?
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:22.940]   I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.940]   Snap.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:24.940]   Terrible stock results.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.660]   Net neutrality vote coming up May 9th.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:30.260]   I want to talk a little bit about that.
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:32.740]   California is now the world's fifth largest economy.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:33.740]   I don't know.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.740]   I should do a victory lap.
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:35.740]   I don't know.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:36.740]   Let's take a break.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:39.980]   We'll talk a little bit more as we wrap things up with our great panel.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:41.780]   First though, a word from WordPress.
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:43.460]   I'm very proud of my daughter.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:50.420]   Years ago, when she was born 26 years ago, I bought abiliport.com because I knew someday
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.420]   she would want this.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:52.420]   She never wanted it.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.420]   She just...
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.380]   She's just Friday.
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:56.860]   Call me in Japan saying I want it.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:59.020]   Said, "Abi, I'm in Japan.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:00.740]   I'll handle this when I get home."
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.500]   But she had just set up her WordPress blog and I was so proud of her.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:04.900]   So that's awesome.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.900]   If you are setting up a blog, whether it's a personal blog, she wants to put her portfolio
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:09.900]   up there.
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:12.860]   Some of her best work, that's a great idea.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:18.340]   But if you don't put your name up on the web, you're letting others control your online
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.940]   presence, no.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:21.460]   You need to have a website.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.460]   If you're a business, twice is important.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:24.460]   Every business.
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.340]   It used to be you had to have a yellow pages listing or a phone listing.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:30.500]   No, you need a website.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.140]   You need a website.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.460]   WordPress.com is the place to go.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.060]   It gives you flexibility.
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:38.340]   It takes away all the technical stuff.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.100]   So you don't have to be a coder or designer.
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.980]   They give you all the tools.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:42.980]   It was so great.
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:43.980]   Abby was so thrilled.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.460]   She chose from the hundreds of beautiful templates.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:50.980]   She got her site up and running literally in minutes.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:54.140]   And of course, if you ever have any questions, the customer support team is fantastic.
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:58.980]   They're there by the way, Monday through Friday, 24/7, and even on weekends, they're
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.980]   there.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:01.380]   So you can always get help.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.300]   If you want to sell something, if you're a business and you sell something online, they
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:09.700]   have great e-commerce options, including a simple buy button to a complete online store.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:12.340]   Then it started just $4 a month.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:15.740]   And when you're ready to expand your online reach, WordPress makes it easy.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:19.100]   Built-in SEO, social sharing, specialized plugins.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.060]   I have the business plan.
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:22.300]   I use the AMP plugin.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.740]   Of course, it's HTTPS.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:29.540]   You know, there's a good reason why 30% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.540]   you're should to.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:35.300]   If you're letting Facebook represent you on the internet, stop.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.820]   Get your website up.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.740]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:40.740]   Create your own website.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:43.220]   They'll even help you get a domain name if you need one.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:45.220]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:49.580]   15% off your brand new website, WordPress.com/twit.
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:51.580]   We thank you so much for their support.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:57.140]   I've been a WordPress customer since practically day one since the early 2000s.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:01.420]   I hope Patrick Delahanty got his baby's name.
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.700]   Patrick, if you didn't register Caitlin, get that name right now.
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:10.420]   Because 26 years from now Caitlin is going to come to you and say, "Hey, Dad, did you
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:12.140]   register my domain name?"
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:13.300]   Congratulations to Patrick.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.740]   He's our engineer.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:21.380]   He and Svet had a baby boy on, was it Friday, Thursday or Friday?
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.220]   9 pounds, 7.7 ounces.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.220]   Woo!
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:25.780]   It's a healthy baby.
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:26.780]   That's a good word.
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:27.780]   Thank you, Ashley.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.780]   It's a very healthy baby.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:30.300]   Healthy baby.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.660]   I think they were worried because Patrick was over 10 pounds on.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:33.660]   He was born.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.660]   He's a big guy.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:35.660]   Goodness.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:39.900]   Anyway, congratulations to a little family announcement.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.900]   I wanted to pass along.
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:46.700]   How do you guys think about the T-Mobile Sprint merger?
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:50.840]   First of all, is it going to get regulatory approval?
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.180]   Who knows?
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:54.260]   Perhaps.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:56.100]   It's kind of a mystery.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:00.340]   You know, it was Tom Wheeler at the FCC who last time, and this was five years ago, said
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:02.100]   that it's not going to happen.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.260]   But things have changed a lot in the five years.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:08.460]   First of all, neckties have been replaced by blinged mice.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.460]   True.
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:10.460]   We are in future.
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:12.460]   That was the first thing that happened.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:14.460]   First sign.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:16.300]   That was the first seal that opened.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.300]   Yeah, the first seal.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.300]   Nice necktie.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:21.260]   Second seal is that Sprint is practically gone, right?
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.140]   It's kind of almost over.
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.140]   They have huge debt.
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:27.380]   They're way behind in quality.
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:33.220]   This is a good article Mark Lowenstein wrote for TechPinions.com.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:36.660]   Why regulators should approve the deal?
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.820]   The big issue for me, of course, is competition.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.260]   I like the idea of four big carriers, better than three big carriers.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:44.260]   But Sprint is no longer a competitor.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:47.100]   A stronger T-Mobile would be a good thing.
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:54.300]   He brings up the point that we're going to see a lot of competition from Google, from
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:58.660]   other companies who are going to become wireless providers.
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:03.100]   Dish, for instance, has a ton of spectrum.
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:09.620]   So he also says it's good for 5G because it's expensive.
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:14.100]   You need strong, powerful companies to make 5G happen.
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:16.020]   Sprint probably would not have the horses to do it.
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:19.700]   T-Mobile and Sprint together perhaps would.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:24.700]   There's also, this is a very important point, the issue of spectrum.
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:28.740]   The FCC has been selling spectrum and the idea has been to make as much money as possible.
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:34.300]   That's eliminated participants, including big companies like Google.
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:39.860]   And Comcast has said, "Oh, it's too rich for our purses."
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:45.380]   It's just too expensive to buy this spectrum.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:47.740]   That we maybe need to solve in some other way.
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:51.060]   Well, they just want someone else to build it and then just piggyback on it.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:52.060]   Right.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.060]   Yeah, Google, that's what they ended up doing.
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:55.940]   Someone else just build it and then we'll swoop in and buy a leader.
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:56.940]   Google Fi.
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:57.940]   Dish, though, did buy a lot.
[02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:00.540]   They're just getting buy a lot.
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:08.500]   May 9th, the Democrats are hoping to get Congress to vote on a new bill that would overrule
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.980]   the FCC with net neutrality.
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:13.740]   We are all hoping they get to.
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:16.060]   You might want to write your member of Congress.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:19.140]   They've probably heard a lot from you lately over this.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:21.660]   They've got to get enough signature.
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.660]   Well, I guess they have enough.
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:30.620]   They do, they have enough signatures on a petition.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:35.820]   And it looks like Ed Markey has introduced a formal Congressional Review Act resolution
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.540]   of disapproval.
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:42.300]   Democrats will force a floor vote to restore the rules on May 9th.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:48.140]   It's kind of a last ditch attempt to save net neutrality.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:53.340]   Still we got a long way to go, including if any bill would have to get signature from
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:56.660]   President Trump, which seems unlikely.
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:57.660]   Very unlikely.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:02.100]   So it's not an ain't over, but just keep writing.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:06.700]   And of course, California has its own many states now are talking about their own net
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:08.620]   neutrality bills.
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:14.980]   Apparently New York is now getting into the act as well.
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:16.220]   But do, do, do, do anything else.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:18.060]   We should flip cart.
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:19.700]   Amazon was trying to buy it.
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:28.340]   It's India's Amazon in effect looks like Walmart has put together a deal to acquire
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:34.460]   flip cart for about $15 billion stealing it, snatching it.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:36.420]   By the way, Google will be involved in this as well.
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:39.900]   They're one of the partners snatching it out of Amazon's hands.
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:47.180]   I don't know that probably means more to people in India than it does to me, but I
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:49.660]   think in Amazon has the stuff to work about.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.200]   Yeah, no kidding.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.860]   But Amazon's big problem right now is that they don't have a good international presence,
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:55.860]   do they?
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:03:01.140]   Alibaba and others are beating them in India is a big economy with a lot of customers.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:03.340]   I'm sure Amazon would like to have.
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:07.700]   It's a big coup for Google.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:11.260]   Yeah, they love to be there, of course.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:16.580]   And finally, there is we have a new cyber commander.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:25.100]   So the Pentagon has elevated their cyber warfare unit and in charge, Lieutenant General Paul
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:30.220]   Nakasone, he will be also the head of the NSA.
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:33.100]   It's a dual leadership role.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.820]   He is now leader of US cyber command.
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:40.540]   On Friday, it was elevated to an independent unified command.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.740]   According to Reuters, a bureaucratic change that for the first time puts it on a par with
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.860]   nine other US war fighting commands.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:51.820]   This is an acknowledgement, according to Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, that this
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:57.180]   new war fighting domain has come of age.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:04:02.260]   Here's a little scary rhetoric from the deputy director of the cyber command.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:07.460]   We are ready to unleash our cyber mission forces.
[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:11.940]   This will be defensive, but it will also be offensive.
[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:16.580]   Nakasone, the new director, appeared to favor a more robust response to cyber attacks, such
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:22.540]   as those by Russia in March when he testified at his confirmation hearing.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:26.020]   Our adversaries, he said, have not seen our response and sufficient detail to change their
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:27.220]   behavior.
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.980]   They don't think much will happen.
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:35.420]   Cyber command includes military units trained to both defend against cyber attacks and to
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.260]   initiate them.
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:41.260]   I'm really disappointed that these aren't like anthropomorphic light beams or something.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:45.420]   It's like something called cyber command needs to be cooler, not just actual huge pieces.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:48.060]   This is the voice of cyber command.
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:53.740]   Yeah, we deploy them and they just like shoot out into wherever they need to go and fight.
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:54.940]   It's a new kind of warfare.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:59.280]   We've already we've already we've already seen how disruptive it can be just with the
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.540]   just kind of, you know, Twitter, Twitter and Facebook stuff that Russia's done.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:04.540]   I think get ready.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.220]   This is going to be pretty ugly.
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:07.220]   And I'm not sure.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:08.340]   I mean, this is a long time coming.
[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:10.620]   They should have elevated this to.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.620]   I'd agree defensively.
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:12.620]   Yeah, defensively.
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:17.780]   I don't want to see is something that should have been elevated equally to other arms of
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:20.300]   the military commands.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.100]   But I don't want to see it as an offensive force.
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:25.540]   I think that's a big mistake because it just escalates.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.580]   What exactly do they mean by offensive?
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:29.620]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, start attacking other people.
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:31.940]   I don't want to see us in that business.
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.380]   I don't like that.
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:34.540]   I don't love it.
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:36.940]   I'm going to finish this.
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:38.820]   They're anthropomorphic light beams.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.500]   If it's that may change, that may change my perspective on.
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:46.540]   Yeah, but up until that point, yeah, please, can we not be offensive?
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:48.780]   Let's just hang out and keep ourselves.
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:50.540]   We've seen it and it didn't work well.
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:52.460]   Remember Stuxnet?
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:06:00.900]   Which was, I think the Israeli maybe some help from the US attempt to shut down Iranian
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:05.300]   centrifuges to reduce, you know, to keep them from enriching uranium.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:08.100]   And then oh, it got out.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.860]   And it impacted us all.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:15.900]   We've seen the NSA hacking tools leak out to our detriment.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:19.860]   Because yeah, I don't I don't know if this is I don't know if I want our government
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:20.940]   to be in this business.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:22.500]   Defensive, fine.
[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.460]   Protect our grid.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:24.500]   Please do.
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.260]   That's a great idea.
[02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:31.100]   I'm not sure I like the idea of them creating super weapons, cyber weapons.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:34.260]   That's going to this can only end in tears.
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:37.860]   Yeah, or the next James Bond movie.
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:38.860]   Both.
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:39.860]   Yeah, both.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:40.860]   Yeah, why not both?
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:41.860]   Yeah.
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.660]   Now, if you're more del Toro was running the cyber command, I might.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.940]   Hey, I want to thank you guys.
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:48.940]   You're great.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:50.740]   Thank you for propping me up.
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:56.580]   Miss Ashley, you must follow her on the Twitter and on the Instagram at Ashley is
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.820]   sketch on the Twitter.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:04.420]   Ms. Ashley is sketch on the Instagram Instagram will probably never give me my original username
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:05.580]   Ashley is sketch the back.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:07.060]   So yeah, it's Ms. Ashley is sketch.
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:08.060]   I like it.
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:09.060]   I'm Mr. Laport.
[02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:10.060]   All right.
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:16.500]   I think it's good to have an honorific and don't forget her brand new show launched on
[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:20.420]   YouTube on the CNET channel.
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.220]   Spent of his spectrum hunting spectrum.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.020]   What is it?
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:27.020]   Stream economy.
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:28.020]   Stream economy.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:29.420]   I don't know where I got spectrum.
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:30.420]   Remember, I'm on time.
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:32.980]   I'm on Tokyo time.
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:33.980]   Stream economy.
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:36.580]   By the way, it's like 11 in the morning in Tokyo.
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.420]   There's no excuse at all.
[02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:39.420]   Stream economy.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:44.220]   I'm going to use this excuse for the next four weeks.
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.220]   Be prepared.
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:46.220]   Thank you, Ashley.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:47.460]   It's great to see you again.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:48.820]   Happy to drop by.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:51.780]   And your lovely Italian Greyhound.
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:53.460]   That's my little baby Philo.
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:57.220]   Philo named after Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of television.
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:58.220]   Correct.
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:07:59.220]   You are such a geek.
[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:00.220]   I know.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:01.220]   What a great name.
[02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:05.900]   I love television and he's a good Philo.
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:07.620]   He's perfect.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.620]   You should name him.
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:11.180]   You should have a cat named Farnsworth.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.780]   So I almost named him Farnsworth.
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:13.780]   That's pretty good too.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:15.780]   But it sounds like a phyllo.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:16.780]   It seems like a phyllo.
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:18.540]   It's a cute dog name.
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:22.300]   But it's a dorky version of mylo, right?
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:24.300]   There you go.
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:25.300]   Yeah.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:27.660]   Phyllo means love, right?
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:28.660]   It's the Greek word for love.
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.660]   I think that's good.
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:30.660]   Yeah.
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.820]   You love your Italian.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:34.420]   He's a very loving dog.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.180]   We call him a snuggle boy.
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:37.980]   He's like a little kissy snuggle boy.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.180]   He's really sweet.
[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.180]   Nice.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:42.180]   Again, we got to have this week in pets.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.940]   I think we just did.
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:46.260]   Look, my Italian Greyhounds have their own Instagram.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.740]   It's Iggy Brigade, IGGY Brigade.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:50.460]   I put pictures of them all the time.
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:52.020]   I have three Italian Greyhounds.
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:54.580]   They're very photogenic.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:57.380]   I am going to unfollow Ms. Ashley Isketha.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.420]   Yeah, don't follow me.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.260]   No more stalking Ashley.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.660]   I could stalk her Greyhounds.
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:02.660]   Oh, look at the Aggies.
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:04.980]   I'm trying to make them famous so I can retire.
[02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.980]   Bailey Jenkins and Phyllo.
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:07.980]   Aw.
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:09.980]   That's a dream of a doctor.
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:10.980]   Oh my god.
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:15.820]   Okay, I'm just going to say they seem over alert.
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:18.060]   Well, they hide a treat there.
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.460]   Okay, I just worry about dogs that are over alert.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:23.460]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:26.460]   What do you want?
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:30.460]   That's pretty much how they are all the time.
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.460]   Huh?
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:32.460]   What?
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.460]   What?
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:35.260]   That's our old lady Bailey.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:36.860]   Oh, hey, old lady Bailey.
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:37.860]   That's Bailey.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:38.860]   Hey, who?
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.700]   Ant Pruitt, always a pleasure.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:47.500]   Tech Republic, follow his new Friday night feeds on YouTube, youtube.com/ant Pruitt.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:50.220]   And anything else you want to plug?
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.580]   Well, first of all, thank you for having me.
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:54.540]   Always plug this on this network.
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:55.540]   It's truly an honor.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.860]   You always say that.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:58.700]   And I feel funny about that.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:02.740]   Of course, it's an honor for us to have you.
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:11.820]   But yeah, just follow me on YouTube, youtube.com/ant Pruitt and also Ant Pruitt on Instagram.
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:16.220]   I have my dogs on it every now and then just look for Kylo Finn.
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:17.220]   That's his name.
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:18.220]   Such a good guy.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.220]   And then Jackson's in there somewhere.
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:20.220]   Such a good guy.
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:21.940]   But yeah, definitely come check me out on YouTube.
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:24.140]   I'm having a little more fun with that over there.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:30.860]   And on either platform, I try to engage everyone that comes over there and comments and what
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:34.060]   not because I think social media should actually be social.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.700]   Hey, man.
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:36.700]   Yay.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:42.140]   And by the way, I still haven't bought another drone and everybody who makes drones should
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.140]   be happy.
[02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:48.100]   Oh, by the way, it seems like every time you have a sponsor, they get into my pocket.
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.260]   So you're doing something wrong.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.260]   That's good.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.260]   Maybe I should get a drone sponsor.
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:54.580]   You know, I had wine last week delivered.
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:55.580]   Did you try that wink?
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.780]   Isn't that good stuff?
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.780]   Yeah.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.780]   Good stuff.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.780]   Yeah.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:00.780]   And thanks so much.
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:01.780]   I'm going to have Casper here soon.
[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:02.780]   You're going to have a new mattress.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780]   Life is going to be.
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.780]   Every time.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:05.780]   Same.
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.620]   But we'll know that you've really fallen into the pit when you start rocking the mouse
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:10.620]   bowl.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:13.060]   Oh, I already ordered one on eBay.
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:14.060]   Yeah.
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:15.060]   Yeah.
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:16.060]   Are you guys selling those on an Etsy store?
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:18.060]   I should get an Etsy store going.
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:19.060]   There you go.
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.260]   I like it.
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:22.220]   I think it's a look.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:26.940]   It's a clear choice.
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:29.780]   It's a clear choice.
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.100]   We thank you so much, Michael Sargent.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:34.900]   Always a pleasure to have you on senior editor at Mobile Nations where it works over there
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:41.100]   with all of our friends at Mobile Nations like Ren Ren Ren and Ren and Ren and serenity.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:45.660]   Oh, yeah, it is Ren and Georgia and Georgia.
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:47.500]   So nice to have you all.
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.500]   All right.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.500]   All those guys.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.500]   We did quit.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.500]   We did not normally meet these folks.
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:55.500]   I've never met Ms. Ashley or Micah in person here.
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:59.060]   When they told me that this was going to be the panel, I said, oh, that's going to be
[02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:00.060]   great.
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:01.060]   That's going to be fun.
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:02.060]   That was right.
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:03.060]   What fun panel.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:04.060]   And you're all dog lovers.
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:07.220]   But they didn't tell me is that I would have been a new former Nick.
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:09.020]   Neckwear during the show.
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:10.700]   They have no way of knowing that.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.300]   Had I been told about that, I wouldn't have just skipped out.
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:18.500]   I would have been like, by the way, I just want to point out that the original iMac
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.500]   makes an excellent pocket.
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:26.500]   Square or I'm thinking maybe a belt buckle.
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:28.220]   You know what?
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:29.620]   Can I say I pass?
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:31.620]   We need to make that happen.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:32.620]   Great monocle.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.620]   Looks like a monocle.
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:38.700]   It has one massive feeling as a monocle.
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:39.700]   You can't see through it.
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.940]   But then again, it had many massive feelings as a mouse.
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:43.220]   That shouldn't stop anybody.
[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:44.220]   It's translucent.
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:47.140]   I feel like you could somewhat see through it if you really wanted to.
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.140]   I say.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.740]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:50.740]   We do twits.
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.220]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:55.380]   You know, the best thing about monocles is when you're here, surprise, you can go.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:56.380]   What?
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:57.380]   And they can pop out.
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:58.380]   We thank everybody for joining us.
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:01.860]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:02.860]   2200.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:03.860]   No, 2300.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.460]   Oh, no, I'm confused.
[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:07.620]   I can't do math.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.700]   2200 UTC every Sunday evening.
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:12.700]   Please stop by.
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:13.700]   Join us.
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:17.500]   If you can't be here live and in person, you could, by the way, if you want to, we had
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.500]   a great group.
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:22.820]   Andrea always comes out for Google I/O, brought a bunch of developers from Europe, Andreas
[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:29.180]   from Spain, and where else are your friends from?
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.820]   They're all shy.
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:32.820]   Are they from Madrid?
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:33.820]   Madrid?
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:35.820]   All Madridians?
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:36.820]   OK.
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:37.820]   The Madridians are here.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.140]   They know how to pronounce my last name.
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.140]   No problem.
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:44.420]   I've, you noticed, by the way, I got it right every single time, Ashley.
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:45.420]   I've been practicing all week.
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:46.420]   Good job.
[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:47.420]   Great.
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:48.420]   That's good.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.700]   We had Taylor from Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:52.540]   We had Lisa from Pasadena.
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:55.700]   We had Alejandro and Ivan from Madrid.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:59.060]   We have Graham from formerly of York, England.
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:05.140]   Nice to have you Graham and also from England, Amanda and Ruth from Chelmsford and Warwick,
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:08.420]   respectively, and Robert from Maryland.
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:09.980]   So there were people from all over.

[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:13.220]   We'll make sure to put a chair out for you.
