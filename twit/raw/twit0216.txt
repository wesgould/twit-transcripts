[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.880]   I am Molly Wood, filling in for Leo Laporte, who is in Dubai at the TEDx Conference.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.960]   And I was just saying that as much as I am thrilled and honored to be hosting Twit this week,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   I frankly would kind of rather be in Dubai, looking at the fabulous buildings.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.120]   >> Except there's a problem with you being in Dubai.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120]   >> There is, yeah.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.080]   They don't want me there.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.800]   Anyway, I'm very excited about today.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   I'm here in the Twit cottage.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.840]   I'm joined by Brian Brush with the host of Scam School,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   >> Howdy.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   >> On the version 3.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   >> How are you, Captain Kirk?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   >> Right here in that, yeah, I'm wearing Captain Kirk orange today.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   >> Because you're the leader.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   You're in charge.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   You run on the show.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.440]   >> It was an accident, but I feel good about it.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   >> I'm wearing a red shirt, which all of us that I've already been saying.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   >> I'm just giving a say.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   >> Dude, take the red shirt off quickly.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.520]   >> I wasn't going to mention it, but, yeah, he's going down.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.920]   Also, joining us on Skype, Gina Trapani, co-host of This Week in Google, so you already
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   know her Twit fans.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   And everyone is so excited.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Hi, Gina, say hi.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   >> Greetings, humans.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   Hello.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.680]   >> This is what happened when we all heard that Gina was going to be on the show.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.240]   Patrick Norton, Colleen, who's totally in charge of the board and the switching and
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   everything today.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.680]   And everybody else was basically like, Gina, it's rock star time.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   >> Yeah, so no pressure.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   >> No pressure.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   >> And you even have the Madonna microphone going on.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   >> I do, I do.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440]   I got the little invisible mic thanks to Colleen.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.920]   I'm feeling very cheek.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.760]   >> Very fabulous.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.320]   And Twit regular because we need somebody to keep us in line around here.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   Patrick Norton.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.240]   >> I don't think I'll be able to succeed keeping this in line.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.360]   I'll just try to keep from getting run over.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   >> Not remotely.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.560]   If he was here in studio, he'd have power, but he's too far away.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   >> It's true.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.560]   He is far away.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   He can't do anything.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   And also, we could probably ask Colleen to turn him off.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   I'm just saying.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   >> We'll see how that goes over.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   >> Look out.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.720]   All right, well then, let's get this train rolling.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.640]   So it seems that the big story of the week and the weekend that just keeps getting hotter
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   and hotter is that a evidently T-Mobile has lost all of the data of its sidekick users.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.360]   Or as Engadget puts it, one of the biggest disasters in the history of cloud computing
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.480]   and certainly the largest blow to danger and the sidekick platform.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.800]   >> Is it looking like it's confirmed?
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   Like it's definitely gone.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   >> They --
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   >> The last -- oops, sorry.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   >> No, go ahead.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   >> I was saying the last email I saw was apparently they were doing a sand upgrade, a fairly standard
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.120]   sand upgrade that they didn't do a backup before the sand upgrade and things went really,
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   really sideways.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.000]   And that they think they've pretty much lost everything that you didn't have backed up
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   locally, which on your phone.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.000]   So anything that's still on your phone, you can probably put it back up on their servers
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.160]   again, assuming you haven't pitched your phone at the wall and discussed and completely
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   built it down.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   >> They're charging people to not reboot their phone.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   Don't turn your phone off.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.200]   See if you can make something happen.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   >> That is so ridiculous.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.800]   >> So you just have to plug in your phone and hope that things are going to come back
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   or that you can back up your phone to your computer.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   >> Basically.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.880]   And that is essentially what they said to people.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.120]   Like, we're really sorry, but your data has, quote, almost certainly been lost.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   >> Wow.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   Can you imagine?
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.360]   >> Can you imagine being the guy who has to write that email?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   Like, how do you -- how do you sit down and start typing that one out?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.040]   >> You know, I feel bad for that guy, but not fairly as bad as I feel for everybody
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.680]   in level one tech support who's dealing with people going berserk on the phone right now
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.240]   because the pictures of their grandkids are gone.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.480]   Like the guy -- the guy who screwed up the backups probably getting fired or beaten with
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   a stick or whatever they do to people who have an oopsie of that magnitude.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.600]   But I really feel bad for everybody that's basically, you know, hello, this is T-Mobile.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.360]   My name is, you know, Noanda, can I help you?
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.960]   And then going through that whole process of, we lost your stuff from really, really
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.000]   sorry and then getting screamed at and then having to, you know, do whatever comes next.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   >> Can you imagine, when is the last time that you've ever called tech support?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.640]   I mean, at least they usually pretend that they can give an answer even though they almost
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   certainly can't.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.680]   Like to call tech support and to basically, you know, and you know every call is like
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.240]   "But, but but but but but but" and then have them go, "Yeah, you're out of luck.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240]   We got a few fun."
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   >> We're really sorry about that.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   >> We're so mature.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.280]   >> Make sure you don't power down, kids.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.320]   >> Now, I tell you, I've never been happier to have an iPhone than right now because before
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.120]   the iPhone, I never would have backed up the contacts and stuff on my phone number because
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.520]   it's such a hassle, such a huge pain in the butt.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   But because it's integral to getting your updates on podcasts and all this and in your
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.960]   calendar and your other synchronization, finally I have a backup for all my numbers,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.200]   I would have been one of those people screwed if I had a sidekick.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.600]   >> Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.200]   I actually think that most smartphone owners who are not, like you said, iPhone owners
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.160]   who are connecting to iTunes all the time for various reasons, usually 80 meg upgrades,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.320]   is that I don't think smartphone users do back up their data.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.760]   >> I know that they do if they've had a phone stolen.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.760]   >> That what?
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.920]   >> They do if they've had a phone stolen.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.360]   >> Well, good point.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.760]   >> They should if they've had anything else stolen and they're still not.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   >> That's the tough thing.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.600]   It's easy to say, "Oh, you should, you should, you should."
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   But I'm saying realistically never, never would have plugged it and never would have
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   backed it up.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.440]   Would have been one of those people saying, "Golly G. Darn."
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   >> Right.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   >> Only I don't think I would have used those words.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.920]   >> The camera is pointing out, by the way, if you have a sidekick, that the reason they
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.240]   don't want you to power out off is that like a palm, the data is stored in RAM so that if
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.680]   it is powered off or if the battery runs out, then all that data is gone.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.760]   As if it's not gone already.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.000]   That is definitely though.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.400]   That is a huge cloud problem.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   >> Now, how many people like to, obviously none of us, I'm saying obviously, but does
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.000]   anyone here have a sidekick?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.640]   That seems like kind of a non-techy kind of guy phone to have.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.840]   Like you don't have a sidekick, do you?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   >> No, no.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.400]   >> I'm actually like a second-class smartphone or something.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.280]   >> Well, that's the other thing it is kind of right.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   It's not an actual smartphone as the weird definitions go.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   It's a messaging phone, so it's definitely even less likely to be backed up.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.720]   But what does everybody using?
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm on a blackberry now because I broke up with my iPhone.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.240]   >> Yeah, it's got to be a type.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.320]   >> Gina, what do you have?
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.560]   >> I have an Android phone, G1.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.400]   >> Yep, not surprised.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   Patrick?
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.960]   >> I was planning on breaking up with my iPhone, then my hardware got repaired and AT&T went
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.040]   to 850 megahertz in San Francisco and it saved our relationship.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.720]   >> It was back.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.120]   >> They actually, 850 megahertz made the iPhone functional because it basically had stopped
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   working in my house.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.320]   >> Doesn't work in the office now?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.520]   Because I know none of the iPhones seem to work at revision three headquarters.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.240]   >> If I, it depends on whether I'm in my cubicle, which is like dead center in the fair day
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.920]   cage, it's a little awkward.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.080]   You know, if it's on the right side of my cube, I get four bars and if it's on the left side
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.120]   of my cube, it gets a bar.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.400]   But I can actually stand up and use my cell phone in the office for the first time ever.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   >> That's pretty good.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.680]   >> Yeah, I think they can't roll out 850 megahertz nationwide and AT&T fast enough for me.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.800]   >> I broke up with my iPhone and then a week later got an email from AT&T saying that they
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.280]   put up a new 3G tower a mile from my house, which sounds like it should have been a want
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   walk kind of moment.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.200]   But then my friends came over with their iPhone 3GS.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Still didn't work.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   >> No kidding.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   >> About living in a fair day cage.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.400]   >> So you're screwed no matter what.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.200]   Sorry, sidekick, sorry iPhone.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.000]   >> No matter what you do.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.720]   >> Actually, Gina, are you happy with your Android phone?
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   Since we're talking about phone.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.680]   >> Android, I don't love the handset.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.840]   I would love to upgrade to an handset.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.640]   The G1 is kind of crappy, but Android is fantastic and I do love it.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.560]   I'm actually wondering if syncing to Google, that doesn't really count as a local backup
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   does it.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   But I don't know.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.080]   I feel like Google is probably not going to lose all of my account data anytime soon.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.400]   This is just a ridiculous, I mean, how do you not have a backup, even if it's a day old
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   backup?
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   I don't understand that.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   >> Yeah, I agree.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:05.000]   >> It is, I mean, most importantly, it is totally unacceptable to have a cloud service
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.800]   like that and have that level of failure.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.400]   And apparently there's already a class action suit.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   >> Like anything will ever happen to the cloud again after this.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   This is a one-time deal.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   >> It's going to be fine forever.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   >> It's going to be fine.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.160]   >> There's one really good thing about this is that everybody who has anything stored in
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.480]   this manner, anybody who's doing cloud computing right now on a really serious basic or basis
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.440]   is now freaking out to make sure that they've done due diligence and have better backup
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.600]   systems in place.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   At least I hope.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   >> Hopefully.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   >> As I stare at Gmail and Google Docs and Dropbox and-
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.960]   >> I'll tell you what, at least it's just a one-off isolated thing.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.200]   It's not like there's another story that's similar to this of somebody who's data's in
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.120]   the cloud and all of a sudden they can't access it.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   Like that would never happen twice in the same week.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   >> No, never.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.960]   There's no way that if you were, for example, a fan of Google Voice, you just couldn't make
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   calls in certain areas.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   >> Okay, well maybe that, but-
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   >> Where are you?
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   >> Facebook could be fine, right?
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   >> Oh yeah, Facebook could be fine.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   >> Like there's no chance that- >> No, no.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   >> Oh wait.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.600]   >> They're just like a bunch of different stories like this today.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.840]   Yeah, we'll get to the Facebook thing in a minute.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.120]   Although first, I want to talk a little bit about Google Voice because this is pretty
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.200]   germane to our kind of mobile device discussion.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   The FCC now says after AT&T accused Google of violating net neutrality laws by refusing
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.280]   to provide calls to rural areas.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   >> For free.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   >> For free.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.600]   Even though they're not a phone service.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.160]   And we, I believe, on my show characterize that as bald face lies from AT&T.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.820]   Nevertheless, the FCC has decided to investigate whether Google has in fact violated telecommunications
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.280]   laws by refusing to connect some calls to rural areas.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.360]   >> By the way, I cracked the code on this one.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.120]   Because you notice at the very end of the article it says, they asked how the service works
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.280]   and how Google sees the service fits under the FCC's regulatory schemes.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   It also asked the company to explain its invitation only policy for the trial service.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.640]   I think they're upset because they did not get Google Wave invites.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.280]   >> I think that's what this is all about.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.160]   >> That seems like the most likely possibility.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.920]   Now, Gina, I feel confident that you have probably talked about this issue and exactly
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   how Google Voice works.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.280]   Is the FCC just misunderstanding the way that Google Voice works or do you think this is
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.000]   a legitimate kind of thing to look into?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.680]   >> I think that the FCC does kind of misunderstand.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.520]   I think Google Voice is kind of a new product and I think that it's important to understand
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.720]   that Google Voice is really kind of a complement to your existing phone service.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.240]   You can't make Google Voice calls without a phone to begin with.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.880]   It is not a phone service, just a sole phone service.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.120]   It's kind of an addition to that.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.360]   It gives you number portability and it gives you voicemail transcription, but you still
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.400]   need a phone to use it and they are providing it for free.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.360]   So I think Google's argument is valid.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.240]   I think it's so funny that they title, you know, like Google's official blog posts are
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.960]   always very kind of politically correct, but this one was like sex call centers and Google
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   Voice.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.360]   They're making the argument that some of these rural areas that are really expensive to route
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   calls to have sex call centers in them to pump traffic into them.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.080]   So I thought that was kind of an interesting point that they brought up.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.280]   But I think Google has a good point.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   It would be really interesting to see.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.240]   This is totally one of these new technologies.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.000]   They're sort of breaking the ground and the FCC's got to figure out, well, are we going
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.760]   to treat these types of things differently?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.680]   Yeah, I think it's reasonable in that sense for the FCC to at least look into it and
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.440]   say, well, okay, there's no question that this is new technology.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   And even if it's not strictly speaking a phone service, is there a reason to check this out?
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.840]   And then I mean, I guess you do have to wonder, like, is it okay for Google Voice to say we're
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.800]   just not going to provide service to those areas?
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   If they're if they want to play in the telecommunication space, and I think what got AT&T so frustrated
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.760]   is that they were thinking, well, you're playing in our sandbox, but you don't have
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.720]   to follow the same rules.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.600]   Although one could argue should you have to follow the same rules if you're not actually
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.040]   a phone service, which I guess I just keep coming back to.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   So did I hear right?
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.800]   Did you say that the app only works on the phone?
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.400]   There's no way to use the same service from your desktop PC?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.800]   Well, I mean, from your desktop PC, you can initiate a call through Google Voice, through
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.200]   your Google Voice number, but it calls your phone.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   Right.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.400]   Okay, so you can receive incoming calls that way.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   Gotcha.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   Right.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   Right.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.960]   And I mean, cell phones, I don't know if this is comparable, but cell phones can't make
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   911 calls, right?
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.680]   Or from certain voice, or IP.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.200]   I mean, there are restrictions with different types of phones that there are, right?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.080]   I mean, at this point, most of the voice over IP should be sorry, all of a sudden the blue
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.320]   angels are like roaring over the building.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.360]   Well, just if I start looking up and like hiding under a desk, you'll know why the,
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.040]   most of the voice over IP systems now have 911 call running the major ones.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.640]   And that's, I mean, that's, that's kind of been the classic fight between traditional
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.920]   telecommunications and everything coming out of like Silicon Valley or technology or whatever
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.640]   it is, is, is all the people like AT&T is looking around like, we have to comply by all
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   these rules.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   We have to do all these things.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.080]   Oh, yeah, Google, you call us out anytime you feel annoyed by anything we do.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.360]   So I think there may be just a little bit of tit for tat going on here to try to make
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.560]   it feel more competitive for AT&T or, or maybe less annoying because they have to be looking
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.840]   at Google and be like, what are you guys?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:17.480]   They're just scared to death that they can't tie people to a single number for, you know,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   a two year contract.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.040]   And that's the thing is that they're saying, look, here's this thing that has a really
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.000]   good chance of taking away business from us.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.160]   And yet they don't have to follow the same rules that we do.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.400]   And they basically get to keep going around acting like big old jerks who still everybody
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:32.920]   loves.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.000]   I mean, I think they're just like, oh, I hate you, Google.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.440]   Do you think it'll really take away business or because it seems like it's going to be
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.160]   a compliment to any existing phone line, whether it's a landline or a cell line, or
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   you thinking like people are just going to hop from account to account as soon as they
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.040]   have like a relatively guaranteed number through Google Voice.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Question mark.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.720]   I mean, I think it's what Gina said is that people are going to be less.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.920]   They're going to be, you know, if this technology becomes widespread, let's start that right
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.840]   because right now it is very tiny.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.520]   It's a very tiny number of people who are using it.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.160]   But if it becomes widespread, it's absolutely the kind of thing that could make people significantly
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.080]   less interested in signing those long contracts with a given carrier.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   They're going to be a lot more interested in buying unlocked phones paying for a small,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.240]   you know, a much smaller and cheaper plan and then using something like Google Voice with
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.440]   like, or using a Verizon MyFi and an iPod touch, you know, and, and, and Vonage or something.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.280]   I mean, I think it just, it says it makes the whole sort of cell phone hegemony slightly
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   less necessary.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   It's true.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.400]   But yeah, so let's moving on to the cloud.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   Let's get back to the cloud thing.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.600]   Now that we've got that boring Google Voice out of the way, I think.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   Why your story?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Brushwood was totally trying to skip that.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.960]   It's like, I don't want to talk about it.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   It was related.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   It won floor.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   No, it doesn't segue.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.880]   It was a good segue.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   I agree.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   I blew it.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.680]   It got slapped down.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.960]   Anyway, yeah.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   So people are reports.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.320]   So last week, about seven or eight days ago, there were all these outages on Facebook.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.640]   I saw one that said that the accounts were down for maintenance.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.320]   And then apparently now reports are still rolling and like crazy that people cannot
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.040]   access their accounts.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.480]   No word on whether those accounts are actually gone for good.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.200]   But don't know if it's a sidekick problem yet.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.320]   But people are still shut out.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.240]   I haven't seen, I haven't seen super widespread reports, but it does sound like the inaccessible,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.920]   the inaccessibility continues.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.680]   I'm not one of those guys that's totally like sucked into the Facebook vortex, but I
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   know people who are that way and I would imagine they would just explode their brains
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   with frustration trying to deal with that.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Yeah, I can't imagine.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.360]   Well, Facebook outages, I mean, forget Twitter outages, right?
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   A serious Facebook outage, that is Ragnarok right there.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   Not funny.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.960]   It took me a second to remember what Ragnarok was.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.360]   Like, is that a band?
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.520]   Disaster it should be.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.400]   If it's not, Ragnarok is a great band name.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.800]   Speaking of, you know, sites with outages, Twitter is apparently, this was so sad for
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   Twitter because there were reports that Twitter was having talks with Microsoft and Google
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.160]   on all things D about big data mining deals.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.760]   And then right in the middle of that last week, Twitter outage.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   Oh, did they?
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.560]   I think, I'm sensing a theme in all these stories.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   I know.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.600]   The cloud is not your friend.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.800]   Why does this feel like 1995 all over again?
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.680]   Yeah, and the Twitter outage was particularly creepy, right?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.720]   Because it wasn't like Twitter's down, it fell well.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.800]   It's like you can only see your own updates and no one else is saying anything.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   You're alone in Twitter.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.440]   I'm like, it was really scary.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.800]   And I think it happened for all of us, whereas at that awkward moment where we made a joke,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.280]   we're like, right guys, right?
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   Right.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   Right.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   It's this thing on.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.680]   You know what's funny is I didn't even know there was a Twitter outage, but I had that
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.880]   moment, the moment you described it, I'm like, that's why nobody thought I was funny that
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   day.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.800]   I know, I had it too and I didn't know.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.360]   And then it was like a day later that I read there was an outage and I was like, oh,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   a few.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   You know, that, to go back to the Facebook thing, like really briefly, I think this is
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.800]   the thing that scares me about cloud computing the most.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.040]   It's not that like we're going to have some giant server outage.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.360]   Everyone's data is going to be gone.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.640]   I mean, that's a possibility.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.600]   My greatest fear is that one day somebody is going to try and brute force my Gmail login
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.120]   and Google is going to decide that to make my account inaccessible.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   It's a free service and I can't contact them and they won't let me back in.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.120]   So just my account will be down.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.080]   So you know, the whole internet won't be up in arms.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.440]   I'll just be screwed.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.600]   You know, and you know, if I wasn't doing this, we can Google no one would know about
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   it.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.400]   The lock out is a thing that I'm a little more concerned about.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   It's absolutely true.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.320]   It's more the sort of the secret police threat than the, you know, actual apocalypse kind
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   of thing.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.480]   Well, so I always like laugh about a certain ex-ebay person who wants to be the governor
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.760]   of the state of California.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   I'm like, you're the person who's single handedly responsible for the worst customer service
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.560]   I've ever received in my life.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.960]   You lock down $1400 in my cash in an e in a PayPal account because of something you refuse
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.400]   to explain and couldn't explain unless I faxed in a copy of my driver's license and my social
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.760]   security number to a random number.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.160]   Like, and I'm sitting there and I'm like, you know what I mean?
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   Like, you like, and people are like, you know, and you sit there and I completely understand
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   where Jean is coming from.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   It's just like, look at that.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   Like, yeah, everything, if everything's gone, it's really gone.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.280]   And if you can't call anyone, you are so beyond screwed.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.520]   And it's, it's a little frightening.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.200]   As I've had Google outages when I was, you know, Google was my, has been my primary email
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   forever.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.640]   And, you know, it almost never happens, you know, but I've had Google outages, have a
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.160]   Gmail outages happen while I was on deadline, you know, and that's like you're, you know,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.440]   so you're calling people up, you're setting up an alternate account, you're transferring
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.000]   stuff and that's a, that's a bad thing.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.560]   Especially when literally there's no one you can talk to to try to resolve the situation.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.640]   And as the trend toward free cloud services increases, so, you know, it's like this total
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   inverse, right?
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   And customer service accessibility decreases.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.600]   And I mean, Facebook is a perfect example of this, this, the most important site in the
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.960]   world to some people, the most important thing that they do all day, all day long at six
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.680]   minute intervals, check Facebook.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.240]   And then if you go like mafia wars, oh, God.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.880]   Can I just, can we farmville?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.720]   Can we put a stop to the mafia wars?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   Down with it.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   I can't.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   I'm not gonna walk mafia wars.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   I was like, what's the least likely people in the world to like people you would never expect
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   are obsessed with mafia wars.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   So anyway, there it is.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   Really important.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.680]   And if you go to the Facebook customer services page, they have a list of most commonly asked
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.320]   questions on Facebook and the number one question on their most commonly asked question
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   page is how do I contact Facebook?
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.320]   Because you're the most important thing to do all day.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.080]   You cannot find them.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.280]   You cannot get in touch with them.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.160]   And number two is how do I delete my account?
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.920]   Ha, which I thought was kind of surprising.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.200]   Well, on the Twitter thing outside of their fail this week, I actually am super excited
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.440]   about the talking that they're doing because this is the light at the monetary tunnel for
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   Twitter.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.720]   And I think none of us wants to see Twitter become wholly ad supported where all of a sudden
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.200]   we get ad alerts on our phones.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   But this is a way.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   I'm sorry, Brian.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.080]   Are you telling me Google and Microsoft will not monetize Twitter through advertising?
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   Who knows what they're gonna do.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.960]   But the talk is that they're looking at aggregating all the results of what's happening real time
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.880]   on Twitter and involving it in the search engines where there's some fabulous data
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   mining to be done.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.040]   This is literally the pulse of the world at any given time.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.520]   It's a giant open source, open conversation where all of a sudden like there are companies
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.240]   you know like Gallup organization that you have to pay a lot of money for poll results
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.120]   to know whether people like something Nielsen, you know, people run these little studies to
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.800]   find out what's going to play well for the public, what's not.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.400]   And if they can find a way to mine all that, in fact, before it got absorbed into the mother
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.920]   ship, some eyes before it became search. Twitter.com and got totally broke.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.160]   They had a really cool thing they were doing where they were taking.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   You could put in a search word and it would figure out how many positive words were associated
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.480]   with that object versus negative words.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.680]   And it would actually give you a visualization with red and green and colors in between,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   which I guess is just brown.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   I think it was white in this.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.160]   But all of a sudden you could know like I remember typing in when scam school launched
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.000]   to see that okay generally people are digging on scam school.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   They're mainly saying positive words associated with it.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:14.080]   Yeah, I mean, I think that it doesn't, well, frankly, the idea of being able to actually
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.920]   monetize anything like this effectively through advertising, at least right now, is not really
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   working out for anybody.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.840]   So I do assume that they're hoping to make money on data mining.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.120]   I mean, that alone is- I thought Facebook was making money.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.680]   Or am I just completely- Facebook is cash flow positive.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   They're not necessary.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.320]   And that's, you know, that's very different from profitable.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.400]   They may be able to like, we don't know exactly what I mean.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.080]   They're maybe just covering their own expenses, but not paying back their investors.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.160]   But either way, they're getting some money.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.440]   And I think a lot of that money is coming from data mining.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.400]   If Twitter could cut those kind of deals, they would need- what's interesting is they'll
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.600]   need a lot more than the 54 million users that they have now.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.520]   I mean, it's not like they actually are aggregating-
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.680]   It's a useful service, but it's not valued at $1 billion useful by any stretch.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.960]   But you got to remember also, not only do you know what all of America's saying or
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.840]   whatever the segment of America's that's using it, you know by demographic, you can
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.040]   know exactly what 14 to 16 year old girls are saying about any particular topic at a given
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   time.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   If they filled out their profile.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   I think most of us do.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   I do.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   I think most people do.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   I think so.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.040]   Because everybody's looking for dates.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.960]   I think that's a techie thing to do is to put in a bunch of bogus information.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.440]   That's something like- I don't think most people like my mom wouldn't do that.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   She'd be like, "Oh, well, they're asking.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.240]   I got to give the truth."
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   Absolutely.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   All right.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.440]   Let's take a little break since we've now annoyed everybody with talking about Twitter.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.080]   Leo has kindly pre-recorded some ad stuff for us, so I don't have to do it.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   Take it away, Leo.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.200]   Brian Brushwood, Molly Wood and the gang.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   So good.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Oh, it's spooky.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   Shwooden Wood is good.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   Leo Leport here.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   Hello.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Didn't mean it erupt.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.160]   I just want to mention just I'm just I'm just I'm driving.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.200]   It's a drive by commercial to mention our great friends at squarespace.com.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.880]   Have you made a website with Squarespace yet?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   Yes.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.160]   Look, even if your blog is running on WordPress or another platform, especially if it's running
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.280]   on WordPress or Typepad or moveable type or blogger, I want you.

[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.120]   And now here are the stars of our show back to schwoodenwood.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.720]   We sound like a crime fighting duo.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   I do.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.040]   I think maybe we should start a band.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.200]   Or at least a website.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.920]   All right.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.480]   Let's talk a little bit about the moon bombing.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   Yes.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.040]   The best headline I've seen about the moon bombing this week was like it was really exciting
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.080]   for scientists and then the public didn't care.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   Really?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.280]   We love the headline though.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   Are you kidding me?
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.400]   Yeah, moon bombing blowing up the moon.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.320]   Did you ever see that Mr. Show sketch?
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   No.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   America blows up the moon.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   Just a Robert Young over at WeirdThings.com.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.160]   That's how he pegged the whole thing.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.840]   He was like, NASA's blowing up the room, moon for reals.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.920]   But instead of the actual link, he linked to the Mr. Show segment where it was all fake
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.640]   news footage of them actually blowing up the moon.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.000]   But in this case, so aren't we basically just trying to see if we can go live there?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This is not the first time we've changed.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   I know it's not the first time we've looked for water.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.880]   Well, but in that same spot because wasn't there, there was like an errant satellite that
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   wasn't being used anymore.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.440]   They had to go down anyway.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.680]   So they went ahead and they pegged at it roughly the same area on the pole.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.400]   And they didn't really see anything because they said, "Ah, it was a long shot.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.560]   We didn't know if we would actually see anything or not."
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.760]   But this one was actually built for the purpose of finding out if there's a lot of water on
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.320]   there.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.480]   Which even then, I think they were excited about maybe two or three percent water.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   Right.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.440]   But it sounds like they didn't get the plume of splashing-ness that they were hoping for.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.760]   They got, it's too early to tell, but they were like, when they break it down, they said,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.320]   "Well, we were looking for a really plumish."
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.120]   They said like bad expectations.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   They said, "Who is it that we're looking for?"
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   I thought the room was going to be gone.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   And I was going to correct them.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.040]   I was like, "You should have gone when it was a full moon, so you make sure you get the
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   whole thing."
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   This is bogus.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   What they were really doing.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.680]   They should have been playing that little bit graphic.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.000]   It just said, "Expedation's so high.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.880]   They're like big animation of what would happen."
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.480]   And then it was like, the photos were just sort of this grainy black and white thing.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   What actually happened?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.880]   It's such a letdown that animations are so much cooler than real.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.000]   But I just want to know, I want to have been in the meeting where they said, "Let's just
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.400]   slam a rocket stage into it."
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.840]   You know how we should do this?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.440]   I mean, I could see it out as like gentlemen.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   I do.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.440]   It's like I'm again.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   But the guy who came up with ballistic re-entry, which is basically what we used for mercury
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.120]   and Apollo and everything, the guy was like, "We're going to put a really cool fireproof
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.080]   substance on the bottom of a can, and that's going to slide through the earth's atmosphere."
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.480]   And then a parachute's come out.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.400]   Everybody gave him like, "Looked at him like wily, Coyote.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.840]   He'd come to life with a giant box of Acme."
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   Yes.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   That's how I had to be.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   That's how I imagined the meeting.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   Totally.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.120]   That he was like, "No, seriously, it sounds slapstick, but I think it could work."
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.480]   Listen, guys, we got about $100 million left in the budget.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   What do you want to do?
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.760]   I want to shoot a rocket to blow up the moon.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   Done.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Done.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   Actually, apparently the science they're pretty excited about, the Wired article was very
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.840]   complimentary on how everything went.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.000]   Everything was real smooth.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.760]   And of course, that's the problem is that the devil's in the details and you have to wait
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.040]   for all the analysis to find out what this really means long term.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.560]   But apparently it was a success.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.560]   Yes.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.040]   Well, if you don't have to shoot water in the space, then long term space exploration starts
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.000]   becoming a lot more practical because you could stuff more non-—
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   It's like, "I keep it's voice.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   We got a characteristic order."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Totally.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.440]   It's a $10,000 per pound to send stuff in a space right now.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.080]   And so if you can find the water there, obviously, if you want to live off land.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   If you thought Evian was expensive.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.200]   Yeah, to be fair, they're not probably really looking for ways for us to live there.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.640]   Let's be honest, we're going to need a new rock.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.520]   They are in fact hoping to make it like a little pit stop for space exploration.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.840]   And also we could live there.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.680]   So speaking of flashy technology, this, I thought this story was very exciting at news.com.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.600]   Wait, I just realized that was a pun.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   Was that a pun?
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.840]   Oh, that was a good pun.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   Thanks.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   All right.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Good catch.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.760]   Sounds like so we heard, I think last week about light peak, this idea of Intel's light
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.880]   peak, which would be a universal connector for computers and other devices, which just
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.360]   sounded like, "Oh, pie in the sky.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   Water on the moon."
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.200]   Well, at least one company is saying that they may actually be in mass production on
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.760]   light peak technology by the beginning of next year, 2010.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   Can you imagine?
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.280]   I'm a little bit nervous about, I mean, first of all, I think it's a little connector.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.000]   I think it's great that they're moving forward.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.080]   I'm a little bit nervous about replacing everything with fiber optic cable because you'll notice
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:46.280]   it says in there, like it was a big deal that you could curve it to like, you move the
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.200]   wire into a one inch diameter, but it's like with copper, I mean, I don't think any of
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.480]   those wires would survive travel on the road with me anyway for anywhere because it's like,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.000]   you know, everything gets scratched up.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.560]   Are you, are you, no, optical cables.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.440]   I mean, if you, if you bend it at right angles and beat the hell out of optical cables are
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   actually pretty tough.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   Are they?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.200]   I mean, I, I, I'm not going to say there as tough as copper.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.040]   You definitely don't want to be bending them at right angles and, you know, tying them
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   into knots and stuff.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   But let's be fair.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.000]   This is, there's a real big difference between Brian Brushwood and the average consumer because
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.400]   I don't know if you guys have seen his iPhone, but, um, I replaced it.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   It's fine.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   Okay.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   Everything's fine here.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   All right.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.440]   He's like, he's like, when you have like a son who's like five or six and then he breaks
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.400]   everything and you don't even know how it happens because everything.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.600]   Hardler beating on a drum.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   I hear you.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.480]   I think that's kind of like him, but it does sound like these cables would be at least
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.160]   slightly, but then the other thing though is if it was actually university, you know,
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   a universal connector like who cares?
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.880]   Cause everywhere you go, boom, there'll be cables.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   That's true.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   Cause it's universal.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.120]   And in fact, I'm, I'm in general a fan of people jumping the gun and just not waiting
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.240]   for something to be a settled standard just to get out there and start making it and
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   getting it in people's hands.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.320]   And I know it's frustrating when you got to buy stuff all over again, but I'm ready
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   to see the technology progress.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.040]   Although it's supposed to be really damn fast, right?
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.640]   I mean, that's, that's the really exciting thing, right?
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.480]   I mean, I, I get the whole universal cable thing, but it's supposed to be like super,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.200]   crazy fast, 10 gigabits per second.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   Yep.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   That's enough for video.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Replace everything.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.640]   I love the concept, but I'd be like, I was covering ultra wide band for a while.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   And it's like, you know how all those wireless connections we have to our HD TVs right now?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.680]   Oh, wait, there's like, you know what I mean?
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.240]   It's, it's, I think it's an awesome concept.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   I will be delighted if it ships, I will be delighted if it ships next year.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.440]   I will also be incredibly shocked because cable and wireless cable and faster cable
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   standards.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.720]   You know, I mean, it always takes forever to roll it out.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.520]   And then you have to like figure out.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.880]   But there's a buzz factor to cash in on.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.680]   I mean, if, if a year from now the technology is hyped a lot more and somebody says, guess
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.520]   what it's here, you're going to get a substantial number of consumers running out and insisting
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.680]   that their new computer have, you know, whatever just built into it, whether or not it actually
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.400]   works, whether or not there's anything you can do with it.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.320]   Well, there's been a very hopeful PR rep from a company that's hoping to make a lot of
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   money on this.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.960]   It's like a real is to understand that there's a financial benefit to jumping on a man wagon.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.520]   USB was, I mean, USB was out for like six years and on tens of millions of PCs and
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.160]   it took the iMac, you know what I mean?
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.440]   And, and, and Apple beating a bunch of vendors with a stick to come out with USB printers
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   and stuff.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.480]   Same thing happened with deep in the same thing with firewire.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.680]   I mean, look at firewire, right?
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.080]   Well, it never really got beyond Apple.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.760]   Which was a standard that was practically dead in the water or it was just kind of not,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   it didn't have a ton of traction.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.680]   All of a sudden Apple gets behind it in a huge way and firewire and then they turn it
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.600]   into this big video standard and then kill it, which was obnoxious.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.760]   But now they are getting behind light peak in the same way.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.720]   I mean, I think that there's vendor support in a way that that could make it, I mean,
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   granted, it's not going to be massively available in 2010.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.920]   This company's going to start shipping some cables, but it won't be a standard yet because
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.960]   they're applying for a USB standard.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   It won't be in all the hardware yet.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.560]   By 2012, you don't think so?
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   Red total, red 12.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   Gina, be positive.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.560]   What do you think?
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.760]   I wanted to go out there.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.880]   I want really fast cables that'll plug in everything.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.400]   So I'm going to be hopeful.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.360]   I don't know.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.120]   I honestly, I'm not being much of a gadget geek.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.520]   I haven't followed the history of USB.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.640]   I'm going to defer to Patrick and you on this.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.920]   But I mean, I would love to see it.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.040]   Hey, if it comes out and people start asking for it, I mean, I'd love to see it.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.240]   I hope it works out.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Yeah, me too.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.840]   One thing it sounds like is not going to work out for much longer.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840]   DVDs.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.240]   Yes, thank goodness.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   Golf.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.840]   Take forever.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.920]   And you know that DVDs are in fact on the way out when it's not just like tech forward
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.080]   streaming nerds like us who are talking about it.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.120]   It's Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.600]   This was my favorite story of the week.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   This is so exciting.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   I know, me too.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   I thought this was phenomenal.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.360]   He said in an interview with Motley Fool that DVD would only be the primary delivery format
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.160]   for Netflix for the next two years.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.960]   Like he basically said, DVD, at least for us.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.200]   That's what we do.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.120]   Can I tell you that's already like I subscribed to Netflix a long time ago and I sat like the
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.320]   physical media they sent.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.720]   First disc I got was Michael Clayton.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.360]   I sat on it for six months.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.200]   Now keep in mind, I'm watching all the movies on the streaming.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.400]   I'm watching all the series.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.520]   You know, we just finished all of weeds on the streaming service.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.600]   And meanwhile, that one disc sat there.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.880]   So finally we sent it back.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.440]   But now we've changed now instead of sitting on one disc for six months and then sending
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.920]   it back, we get the disc, we sit on it for two days and then send it back.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.640]   Like I literally don't think I've watched a single movie.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.040]   We've gone through like 25 discs and I don't think I've bothered to.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   I just can't be bothered.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.400]   You got to take the disc and you got to put it in the tray and it's like, oh, freaking
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   FBI warning.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400]   Oh, I know.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.080]   And then it's scratch and you have to lay waste on it or get the pledge out.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.960]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.840]   Get all life hacker on us.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.480]   Well, now with the toothpaste and the pledge.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.640]   The pledge is the pledge will help with a scratch DVD for sure.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.040]   You got to go to the mailbox and pick it up.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   It's annoying.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   Yes.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.520]   So DVDs out and I'm still thinking.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   That's what I say.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.200]   I don't like to want to help.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.080]   Sorry, you got to go to the mailbox and pick it up.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   It's so annoying.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   So 21st century.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   It is sometimes.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   I don't know.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.280]   I have to leave the couch to get a movie.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   That's unacceptable.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   Come on.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.560]   My mailbox is, you know, not at the house.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   I've got a mailbox down the road.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.080]   No, I'm not with you, dude.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   There's that.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   This driving me nuts.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   I saw over physical media.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.000]   I have the same annoyance with that.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.280]   I have to put the thing in the thing.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.320]   That's how lazy I have become as a human where I'm just like, I have to go all the way over
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.400]   there and open it and my DVD player is old and it takes a long time for the drawer to
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   open.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.880]   And then I have to move it because it's a changer the next day.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.000]   Oh, and then the worst are the ads that you can't skip past.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.960]   You can't skip or leave.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.440]   But so what, so Hastings didn't specifically say, and this is what is kind of interesting.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.480]   What would take over for DVD?
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.640]   What would supplant DVD?
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.880]   But I think we are all assuming streaming.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.840]   Oh, streaming has gone so well.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.040]   It's so good enough and it's so fast and it's so easy.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.120]   I mean, yeah.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.320]   And Netflix is so everywhere.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.480]   They're in every device now.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.960]   There was a fascinating article in Wired Magazine talking about that decision.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.000]   They were originally going to be another box on your shelf and instead they last minute
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.840]   scrubbed it and said, let's just be on everything and be a software platform.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.400]   And I think it's worked out great for them.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.120]   Good decision on their part for sure.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.640]   Kudos to them for being forward thinking and saying, you know, this primary thing that
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   we made money doing, you know, ain't happening anymore and being forward thinking for sure.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   Yeah, I think it's.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   Go ahead.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.760]   They originally said there was like almost 2020 originally for DVDs and the Hastings
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:42.360]   is only he basically says they expect to keep handling DVDs for another decade at least.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.960]   I just I don't know if the bandwidth is going to cope to getting, you know what I mean?
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.760]   I like streaming movies, but I also like extra features.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.400]   I also like the resolution quality on Blu-ray.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   What?
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.360]   Yeah, you'll have better than 720p over like stream compression.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.000]   The good enough mark streaming has evolved.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.280]   The good enough market is big, but it's going to be interesting also to watch Hollywood
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.640]   still shaking out what it wants to do next.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:13.400]   And, you know, the availability on DVD versus the availability on streaming, there's still
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.160]   like great big wide chasm in between.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.120]   It's going to be massively exploding in the last year because remember earlier this year,
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.280]   that's when he was saying it's going to be 2018 till we stop handling physical media.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.880]   DVD is still our primary mode of distribution.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.240]   And what I think is happening is I think we've seen a tipping point.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   All of a sudden people are jumping on board.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.360]   It's getting easier for them to go to developers and say we want your content and we want,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.480]   you know, we have this distribution method that's secure.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.880]   That's probably not going to get ripped off and people are going on.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.800]   I think I think in the next year you're going to see a massive, massive explosion of the
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.600]   Netflix online library and I couldn't be happier.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:52.320]   I hope for that, but it's also don't confuse Netflix's business model with the entire business
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.840]   model for people that distribute video.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   I definitely think they're not the same thing.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.200]   They're not the same thing, but you have to admit that Netflix is at the forefront of
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.400]   a trend that is increasingly important.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.440]   And it's important because the places that people consume media are exploding themselves,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   right?
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.600]   It's not about anymore just sitting in front of your team and watching.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.680]   On "HD Nation," people are confused about like do we get a Blu-ray player, do we get
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.320]   a set top box, do we need to get a separate one, do we get a home theater PC, do I get,
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.280]   do I buy an LG, so I can have integrated Netflix?
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.960]   Well, I can't use a PS3, but I can use my Xbox 360 and it's also still a real soupy mess
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   for a lot of people.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   How many Xbox 360?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   Well, it will be for a while.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.560]   Yeah, the 100 experience is definitely going to be Blu-ray for the foreseeable future.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.320]   But meanwhile, the good enough market, it's going to be Netflix streaming, I think.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.800]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.440]   I agree, Patrick, that I think that the hard thing is going to be bandwidth.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.120]   It's going to be hard for people to keep up with the bandwidth to do that kind of streaming,
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.080]   especially as the trend in ISPs is to do more throttling and to say we don't.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   More caps.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   And to do caps, exactly.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.480]   I say we don't want to deal with this.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   I know.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.920]   Because there's the 5GB and 40GB caps, I mean a 5GB cap is three movies.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.720]   The 40GB cap, if you've got a toddler that hits play a lot, you can destroy a 40GB cap
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.280]   in like a week.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   Very true.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.960]   But I think there's no, to me there's no question though that that's where we're headed,
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   that we are headed toward an on demand kind of all streaming world.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.320]   And it's going to take us a long time to get there.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.040]   But I think the idea that Netflix realizes that it's not going to be delivering the DVDs
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.320]   as the majority for very much longer, I think is really true.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   And I think that Blu-ray is never going to be as big as the DVD because it's going to
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.520]   be supplanted by streaming.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.000]   By the way, in addition to my prediction that a year from now streaming will be way
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.280]   huger than it is now.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.680]   I also predict that we'll be having a tweet where we discuss the great Netflix outage of
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   2011.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:49.640]   I was worried that Kritle could play to my favorite movie and they cut out on me.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.600]   Those bastards, they lost everything.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.680]   Yeah, this Facebook nonsense, that's nothing compared to the fury.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   Compared to like I was right in the middle of the true blood cliffhanger.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   Disaster.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:07.040]   Well, there's no question that the whole trend is toward digital, including books.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   And the Kindle.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   Very smooth.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040]   I know, right?
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   Very smooth.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   It's like, it's like, tasking at this point.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   She's good.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.200]   Just tacky to be so obvious.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.400]   Amazon cut the price of the Kindle this week.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.160]   Added a global version, which everyone was very.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.560]   So the Kindle now, the Kindle 2 is $259 and they added a GSM version that will work internationally
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.800]   on AT&T's network and partner networks.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.920]   And then that was really, everybody was really positive about that news except for me because
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.640]   I have a Kindle 2 already.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.520]   And it's CDMA.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.520]   And I'm not going to get that.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.720]   And you're just shaking your head no matter what.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.960]   I'm shaking my head because it's, I mean, number one, very smart, right direction because
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.680]   it's obvious that there's a market for this kind of device and whoever gets their first
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.880]   owns the market, at least in the public's mind.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.120]   So this is all very smart for Amazon.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.200]   Unfortunately, I don't think they're cutting the price nearly enough to grab enough of
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   the market.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.360]   It's got to be $99 for me to hop on board.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.600]   They got to take bigger losses on this if they want to actually own that market.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.800]   Because right now, like most, like, why would be most excited about with the Kindle would
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.560]   be to read my regular websites, you know, to actually treat it like a daily newspaper
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   kind of device.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.880]   But the problem is I can do that with my iPhone for the most part.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:22.000]   Yeah, but the reading experience is so much better on a Kindle compared to having read
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.520]   novels on both platforms.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.480]   The Kindle was much more enjoyable and continues to be much more enjoyable than reading on
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   my iPhone.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.920]   But also, you know, they're in a race.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.080]   If the rumors are true about the Apple tablet device and if it's actually going to try to
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.920]   be a reader device, then they have to own that market.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.600]   They have to say, "Nice try Apple, but we already own this."
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.760]   Although, yeah, I don't know.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.120]   Gina, what do you think about the price?
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.600]   The 259, I have argued for a long time that the Kindle was not too expensive, but it is
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.040]   possible that as competition creeps up, there might be a problem.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   259, what do you think?
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.160]   I think I kind of agree.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   I'm with Brian on this one.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.320]   I think it needs to go a little lower.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.520]   I mean, I love my Kindle.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.120]   So does all of us here have a Kindle?
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   I have one.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   No, I do not.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   Patrick, yes.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   And Gina, yes.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.160]   Yeah, I do have one.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.400]   But I got one when Oprah did her big discount thing and I had a gift certificate and stuff,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.360]   you know, because I'm kind of cheap and I wasn't sold on the idea.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.280]   So I do kind of think that the price needs to come down for people to really get on board.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.520]   But the reading experience is definitely much, much better on the Kindle.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.200]   Although, I don't use it to read websites.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.920]   I use it to read books, like long-form books.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   But on the website, I will grab them.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.040]   I'm too far down the Audible rabbit hole.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.640]   Like I just, I mean, not that I love reading online.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.760]   I love reading books occasionally if I'm sitting on the beach or something, but far and away,
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.640]   I'm chewing through a book a week, at least, doing online audiobooks.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   And you're not going to take the Kindle on a beach.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.040]   When I bought, yeah, that's very true.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.960]   When I bought the Kindle, actually, I felt like I had this big dilemma because I had
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.080]   this big pile of IRL books, like in real life books that I felt like I was betraying
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.560]   because I had the Kindle thing and it was a little awkward.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.040]   But I actually think that what is coming out, what's coming out, I don't know, I get weird.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.800]   I used to be that way about stuffed animals too.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.240]   That pair is going to kill me in the night because I played with the other one.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.640]   No, I was just laughing because I thought I was the only person who thought about it that
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   way.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.000]   The books are looking at the Kindle and being really pissed off about it.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.440]   I was like sure that they felt kind of offended.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.840]   The ones that, like, the water for elephants was sitting there on the shelf.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   Seriously, really?
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.080]   You've been ignoring me for like a year and a half and now you've got a Kindle?
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.680]   And then how many books did you buy in the Kindle and not quite read?
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.880]   Because it's a book buying machine as much as it is a book reading machine.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.960]   It is like a compulsive book buying machine.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.880]   Now you know how all my DVDs feel.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   Just sit there on the shelf.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.160]   The Netflix DVDs like, "Streamy, come on, dude, you've had me for six.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   Come on."
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   I don't know, but do you need your...
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   I don't know, but do you need your...
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   Oh, hold my disc.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   You're totally right.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.640]   Like, I have gotten into a situation basically now where if my friends get too many beers
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.160]   in me, I'll buy just about any book.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   You're literally just whittin' it.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Okay.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   Oh yeah, that's a good book.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   A buying it right now.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   Look at me buying the book.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.680]   Look, I need a probation period.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.760]   I need for the Kindle to have a little probation period where you have a grace period after
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.200]   you buy a book, after you make the ill-advised infinite just purchase, to be able to just
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   return it.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.880]   That's why you need to sell my sample chapters.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   To sell it drunk, darling.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   It's the drunk-kindling problem.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   It is.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.480]   It depends on what friends Kindle drunk.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.800]   Yeah, I know that makes me a giant nerd that I have drunk Kindle bought, but it happened.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   That'll be interesting.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.000]   When somebody grabs your Kindle and kind of peruses your library and you just like,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   "Really?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   The DaVinci Code, really?"
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.640]   You're like, "Ah, I did a video actually on how to hide embarrassing books on your Kindle
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.360]   as a how-to because it is such--"
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.640]   Because you buy anything for one thing and then the Kindle, it turns out, is a huge vector
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.120]   for softcore porn.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.200]   There have been a couple of studies that basically say that the best-selling titles on the Kindle
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.600]   are basically erotic fiction because everyone's like, "Awesome.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.800]   Now I can read this on the bus and no one can see."
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.000]   But the problem with the Kindle is that it's such an attention magnet that people grab
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.280]   it and pick it up and start looking through your light, you know, and you're like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.600]   Put that down!
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   Anyway.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.400]   There's no good looking on there on there.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   Uh-oh.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   We got a little little Patrick.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   We'll call him back.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.720]   In the meantime, though, we will talk a little bit about some other competition for the Kindle,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.320]   which is Barnes & Noble planning to do an e-book reader.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.880]   The thing so far is that everybody who announces the plans to do an e-book reader like the
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.800]   IREX, they're still talking about $400.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.280]   Although I don't think there's pricing yet on what Barnes & Noble might do.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.600]   I mean, don't you kind of feel like, "Really?
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   Barnes & Noble?
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   You read her?
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   How cute?"
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.040]   Well, I tell you, the difference between first place and second place, it's a race and Amazon's
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.800]   just running away with it right now.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   Is Sony in it?
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   You guys think?
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   With their reader?
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.000]   I mean, it's like Sony was actually there first.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.440]   They were first, but they weren't first in the mind of the customer.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   And that's what really matters.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.560]   Is it Android involved with this new Barnes & Noble reader, supposedly?
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.320]   Is that the rumor?
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.800]   Yeah, it's expected to run the Android operating system.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.440]   And then if it ran that and then it had wireless downloads, maybe...
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   Interesting.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   I don't know.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.200]   I do feel like the Kindle is the kind of the iPhone of the e-book market.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   Oh, definitely.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.240]   And the whole thing you get if you're good, you know?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.680]   The parallels are so right.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.160]   It's first in the mind of the customer and it's also the way they're doing the $999
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.480]   per book is modeling right off of iTunes, $0.99.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.920]   Everyone griped about the $0.99 download to begin with, but it was very effective to grabbing
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.200]   everyone's attention and pinning it in their mind that, "Oh, I can get songs for a buck."
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   And now it's like, "Oh, I could get any book for 10 bucks."
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   Right.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   Plus it's white.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   Yep.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   Wow.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   Racist.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   That was...
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.880]   No, that was really well thought out in market analysis.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.400]   It's also white like the other one.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.400]   And clean.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   All right.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.200]   I'm not going to dig myself any deeper.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.680]   Let's go ahead and take another break and listen to some Leo, shall we?
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.000]   Schwad and Wood.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Thank you, gang.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.400]   We're going to get back to you guys in just a bit, but I want to mention I know I'm in
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:04.160]   Dubai, but I can't help but dial in via time machine and tell you about go to meeting,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.880]   go to meeting from the great folks at Citrix.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.000]   It's a great way to meet online with clients and colleagues.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.280]   A great way to collaborate.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.480]   According to American Express and they ought to know, the average cost of a business trip
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.840]   is $10,000.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.520]   For one trip.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   And let me tell you something.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.040]   If you're going to Dubai, it's a heck of a lot more and a lot longer.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.760]   And there's such a better way to meet with clients and colleagues, whether they're a
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.960]   cross town or around the world, with go to meeting.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.360]   Forget $1,000.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.760]   How about $49 a month for unlimited meetings as long as you want as many as you want?
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.600]   You start your go to meeting with a single click of the mouse.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.840]   In fact, you could send out outlook invitations automatically or you could just start a meeting
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   as you're on the phone.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.520]   It's so easy to just say, "Hey, look, I got to show you this PowerPoint.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   I want to show you these drawings."
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.480]   This is what you tell your clients or your colleagues.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.960]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.120]   Press the join a meeting button.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   You give them a nine digit number.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120]   Boom.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.040]   They're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.040]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.360]   There's a chat on the side.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.200]   There's meeting attendees.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.640]   It's designed for online meeting.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   It's slick.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.520]   It's elegant because it's from Citrix.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.040]   We've had years to design this and make it the best.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   Very fast.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.840]   You're not sitting there waiting for the slides to change.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.840]   They keep up with you.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.480]   I've used it for our shows.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.080]   A number of our shows use Go to meeting.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.720]   When we have remote hosts like Ray Maxwell, he'll use Go to meeting to show us his screens.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.120]   It's so great.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.280]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.680]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.800]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.000]   You could try it free for 30 days a month of unlimited online meetings.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   You get voiceover IP.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.760]   You get phone conferencing free, award winning.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.080]   And PC World keeps giving it their best in class award for online access.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.080]   I mean, there's nothing better for this.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   For online meetings.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   Nothing better for this.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.880]   I think this is just a must try application.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.800]   Will you try it right now?
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.120]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.520]   You've heard me talk about it.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520]   Why wait?
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   Give it a try today.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.600]   We thank Citrix so much for supporting our shows.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.240]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.320]   Now back, my friends to Schwood and Wood.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   The crime fighting duo.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.480]   He's having a little too much fun with that Schwood and Wood business.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.000]   Wow, me too though.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.400]   Now that I set it past like that.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   What's you saying, Dalsa?
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   I know.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.880]   All right, let's go to everybody's favorite topic.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.640]   Patent infringement lawsuit.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.600]   Look at Ray.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Good times.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.880]   This is a major though.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.840]   Eolos, which is the company that won $585 million from Microsoft when they sued them for
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.840]   government infringement.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.840]   Floodgates are open now.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.720]   They're flushed with success, not surprisingly.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.040]   That happened in 2003.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.320]   They have now sued 23 companies, including maybe you've heard of them.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.440]   Apple, Google, Adobe, Amazon, eBay, Playboy, Yahoo, and YouTube, among many others.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   You know, there's one of those.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.640]   One of those kind of stuck out for the-- could you go down that list again?
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   There's--
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   One of those just kind of popped out of me.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   I don't know.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   Yeah, eBay.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Yeah, that might have been it.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.240]   Yeah, for their use of the plug-ins.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.080]   All right, we're going off the rails.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.040]   They have sued these companies for implementing browser plug-ins in one form or another, you
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.520]   know, browser plug-ins.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.440]   And then another patent, they've sued over another patent that addresses the use of Ajax,
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.720]   asynchronous, JavaScript, and XML.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.920]   So this feels like the kind of thing.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   Since these patents have actually been upheld a couple of times by the patent office, that
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.320]   has the potential to change a lot about the way the web works.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.600]   At least in terms of, I don't know, websites having to pay high licensing fees before they--
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.640]   Well, when I first-- I mean, it sounded to me like it's a legitimate claim.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.680]   I mean, if it was right against-- I mean, if anyone's going to put up an active defense
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.320]   of this, it's going to be Microsoft.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.480]   And once Microsoft goes down-- and if they're in the right against Microsoft, I'm thinking
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.240]   they're in the right against everyone else.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.800]   I'd be interested to hear what Patrick has to say about it.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.880]   This is Patrick Fate right here.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   Hey, man.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.720]   Is I-- I didn't actually get a chance to read this one.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.920]   Is Eolus a holding company that bought the technology patents and has a whole flood of
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   lawyers?
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.840]   Or they are just one of those quiet little companies that nobody knew about that got
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.480]   a bunch of patents back in the '80s?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.200]   The story I heard was that they're the real deal.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.360]   They are the patent holders.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.120]   Eolus and the University of California were granted the patents themselves.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   Yeah, they didn't.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.920]   It's not like they bought it as part of a portfolio.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.840]   OK, because there was some interesting stuff actually going around JPEG and other places
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.280]   where companies were being acquired.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.320]   Basically, somebody did a round of funding, gathered a bunch of lawyers, and started
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:41.280]   combing through IP that they bought to look for stuff that they could use to leverage
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.640]   for lawsuits to generate more capital as a business.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:51.360]   Man, what I'm more scared of is that these guys claim that they have a patent that predates
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.280]   Ajax being implemented.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   That just sucks.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:08.640]   It's kind of like MPEG-4 is actually completely tied up in...
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.040]   Basically, MPEG-4 is completely owned and completely patentable, chargeable.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   One of the interesting things is looking at MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, which has been exempt
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:23.840]   from licensing fees for nonprofit use, which essentially means consumer use, and for businesses
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.640]   that are basically doing short videos or online distribution.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:32.800]   If the patent holders wanted to, they could essentially charge every single person that
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.400]   distributes video online a fee for the use of that the way they do for people who create
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.120]   blue rays or large corporate sites to distribute videos.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.200]   It's like, "Welcome to patent law.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.920]   You own a patent, you defend a patent, you collect cash, and then you start collecting
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   more and more cash."
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:58.760]   It definitely sounds like this is beyond patents as business plan, although potentially even
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   more scared.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.040]   Well, Gina, you look like you were biting your tongue there too.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.040]   What do you think about this?
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.440]   I'm confused about this.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.920]   This patent is a claim that on a program running inside of a web browser specifically,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.240]   like any plugin running inside of a web browser?
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.840]   Yeah, essentially a program that runs within another program.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   Any addresses?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.400]   It's actually even worse than that, Gina.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:29.480]   The summary I'm reading here is the 906 patent, 5,338,906, and US patent 7,599,985.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.640]   The 906 patent broadly covers any mechanism that can be used to embed an object within
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.720]   a web document.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.840]   When Eolus says object, it means any applets or plugins.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.360]   Okay, so anything better than a web document?
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   Okay.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.840]   So, there's a lot of active ex-controls, Windows Media Player, Sons Java Virtual Machine, and
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.600]   any web browser that automatically invokes each applet and plugin when you click on an
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.640]   appropriate link or in violation of Eolus's patents.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.720]   This is from Computer World.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:03.560]   So basically, they're saying anything that's embedded in a web browser, we own the rights
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.520]   to embed anything in a web browser in any way, in any fashion.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.480]   It's a little vague.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.120]   Can I get a guess?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   Fag.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.200]   So, the thing is it's so vague that it is utterly terrifying, right?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.080]   Because potentially, yikes, what is not covered?
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.840]   But then the question that I have is why does this patent keep getting upheld?
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   Yeah, I mean, this is like trying to patent like a design pattern, embedding a program
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.680]   to run within another program happen.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   I mean, I guess you could say web document is another program, but it's like this is
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   just weird.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.480]   It's like saying patenting like, I don't know, putting a paragraph in a document.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.080]   I mean, it just sounds crazy to me.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.960]   I own the patent on putting words inside a book.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:52.200]   Well, what's looking at it's Stephen Jay Vaughn, actually, Von Nichols wrote this up for Computer
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   World.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.960]   And what he's saying is that even Tim Burders Lee has written the United States patent
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.800]   office and said, look, there's pre-existing art here.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.680]   They did not invent this.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.120]   And there's actually, there's people are listing previous browsers that are doing this because
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.480]   these patents came fairly late.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.040]   Hopefully that will help.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   Yeah, it was.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.040]   I hope so.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.040]   Yeah, it was granted in '98.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:20.640]   So you figure if Tim Burders Lee says there was prior art, he probably made it.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   That's absurd, Tim.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.920]   And the whole Ajax thing makes no sense either.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.200]   Ajax is not a plugin.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.920]   JavaScript is a framework and it fetches data just the way that any web document is fetched.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.720]   So I got on, I'm confused about how that works.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.000]   But it's an object that acts within a browser.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.760]   We came up with the idea that you could put something inside of a web browser window.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.840]   The United States patent office gave us the approval for that.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.080]   Yeah, now really.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   Exactly, right?
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.880]   Which you, I believe, have hit on the completely, the most salient and germane point of all,
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.360]   which is that the US patent office not only granted a patent on that, like the idea of
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:00.280]   a patenting a word inside a book, but then they have upheld it three times since then.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.400]   They have said, no, that sounds totally reasonable.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:09.360]   You have in essence, if read properly by the right and most clever lawyer, you have patented
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.200]   almost everything about the way the web works today.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:17.520]   So go crazy, get your lawsuit boots on because you go and dance it.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.240]   Yeah, like it's unbelievable.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.400]   I don't know.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.440]   Yeah, I just feel kind of at a loss.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:28.840]   I mean, I hope that, I don't know that someone comes to their senses.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.400]   Otherwise, I guess everybody's just going to have to pay this guy and then invent a new
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   internet.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.000]   Unless somebody wants to fight, I mean, is Microsoft going to fight this all the way
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   to the Supreme Court?
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.800]   No, Microsoft paid, I think, right?
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.640]   Because they were fighting with the oldest for like a decade apparently.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.740]   Which is a long time to be, well, I mean, obviously Microsoft has money in a lot of in-house
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.960]   lawyers, but out.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.600]   The only, the only ray of hope that we have is that the Supreme Court is currently reviewing
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.400]   the issue of whether software should be patentable.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   Right.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   Altogether?
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   Altogether.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.280]   Software patents is really fuzzy, right?
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.600]   I mean, there's so much prior art involved.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.080]   There's so much, it's not like as much of a cut and dried invention.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.000]   A lot of them are so broad that they lead to these kinds of problems.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Wow.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.600]   So I guess there's some hope there.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:29.360]   Let's hope for YouTube in its defense against Viacom, an exclusive on news.com.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.840]   There's a billion dollar loss.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.920]   There's a one billion dollar lawsuit and then it turns out some email surface that showed
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:43.600]   kind of not surprisingly, in my opinion, that YouTube employees knew that there was unauthorized
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   content on YouTube.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.120]   But it didn't take it down and then may have even uploaded that content themselves.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:55.320]   Well, like, it made it sound like individual employees at YouTube may have uploaded the
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.320]   account.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.040]   And I don't know that that should really be a big factor, but, well, I don't know, actually.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.040]   I don't know anything, first of all.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.520]   But that seems like less of the crime.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:09.000]   But the idea that if they totally did know that there was illegal content being uploaded
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.960]   and as an official policy, they did not do anything about it, that's a bomb.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.600]   And they left an email trail, which is even more horrifying.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.440]   Because that's a, you know, I mean, lawsuits aren't about what's right or what's wrong.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   It's about what you can prove in a court of law against this, this standing, you know,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.240]   I mean, it's just ouch.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:34.120]   It's pretty heavy duty because, I mean, I think pretty clearly YouTube, whatever YouTube
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.480]   has become now, it rose to prominence on the back of pirated content.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.640]   In my opinion, I know that that was the first time I ever heard of YouTube was when, I think
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.400]   it was some cartoon I wanted to watch and it, and that was the first place it showed up
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.400]   allegedly.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   I think there's no question.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.120]   I mean, there's no question that back in the day, and this is, that's kind of the
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   question, right?
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.720]   It was back in the day when I don't, when the, that everybody was still pretty fuzzy
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.320]   on how much you could violate copyright and what was various and what wasn't.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.280]   And YouTube obviously built its reputation on that kind of content and knew about it
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.960]   and probably did upload its own stuff.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   But you're right, Patrick.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.120]   The problem is that there are evidently emails about it.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.920]   And if the reason that it's such a problem is that it would mean that Google, YouTube
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.880]   now owned by Google couldn't qualify for safe harbor under the DMCA, which.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   Right.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.840]   Well, in the system they have now where you wait for a takedown and then once it's brought
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.080]   to their attention by the owner, they take it down.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.520]   I think it's a pretty good system, but obviously that wasn't how it always was.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:35.080]   And certainly if there's evidence clearly showing that their policy was, let it ride,
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.960]   we're getting famous, then that's going to be a problem.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.800]   And maybe Viacom does deserve a chunk of change in compensation for unwittingly being
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.120]   the engine that rose YouTube to prominence.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.200]   Or maybe Viacom could just back off and admit that, that the daily show is where it is
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.440]   right now because of YouTube.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.600]   Well, that's, and that's the two sides of the coin, right?
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.560]   It's like on the one hand, clearly they derive a massive benefit from YouTube and it works
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   both ways.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.920]   So I don't know, freaking lawsuits.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.360]   I mean, really, do you think that, like, Gina, do you think that it's possible that
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.000]   Viacom lost money because of YouTube?
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.960]   Absolutely not.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   No way.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.520]   I don't think so, but, you know, I don't know anything either.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.600]   No, I think you're right.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.680]   I don't think it, I don't think Viacom actually lost any money, but whatever YouTube is valued
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.760]   at, I think you could definitely say that some percentage of that value is derived from
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.400]   the Viacom content that was on YouTube for a long time.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.000]   I mean, I would argue it was a mutually beneficial situation.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Yeah, I would agree with that, totally.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.800]   Regardless of the legal technicalities of it.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.680]   The show's got more viewers because of YouTube.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.840]   YouTube got more viewers because of shows and that's, you know, that's probably, that's
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.680]   my opinion on how it went down a little.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.480]   Obviously, I have absolutely no numbers to support that, but...
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.160]   Yeah, but yeah, I mean, my gut tells me, you know, my father-owned gut tells me that's
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160]   probably true.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.360]   And then, you know, by...
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.120]   If you use the argument that YouTube owes Viacom some kickback because that was the
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.480]   content they used, then, you know, Google would owe everybody on the web a lot of money.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   Yeah, that's the other problem.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   I think they just kind of...
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   I don't understand.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.280]   I sort of feel like everybody should just give a little handshake and walk away.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   Right.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   That's what it seems like to me.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.320]   And I know that with the lawsuit, it's game theory.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.760]   You got to ask for the moon, even if it's blown up.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.640]   But in this case, I'm being a billion dollars, a billion dollars.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.440]   Yeah, come on.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.080]   That's a little R-I-A-A of them.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.120]   I love that you just used R-I-A-A as a sit-it-in for a word I'm probably not going to say
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   on this show.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.400]   Yeah, no, that's why I used that word instead of any other ones.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   Bloggers are...
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.720]   This was the other kind of big news of the week.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.440]   Bloggers are now under the watchful eye of the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   This terrifies me.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   Does it?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   Well, because now I'm in that boat.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   You take Paola.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.000]   Well, no, no, but I'm compensated by my sponsors.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.160]   And now when I want to talk up how great Squarespace is, by the way, Squarespace is
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.800]   the sponsor of Scamschool, which pays Brian Brushwood.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.560]   It's like I'm affected by that.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560]   Now I can't say necessarily what I love.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.800]   I have to go back in my mental role, I'd actually say, well, I don't know.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.000]   Am I being compensated by them in any way?
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   If you're being compensated by them, isn't there an ad?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.520]   Well, there is an ad.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   There is an ad.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.840]   And when I Twitter about Squarespace, hey, everyone, check out my new Squarespace page.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.600]   Oh, do you have to say every single time that you're...
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.240]   By the letter of law, you have to disclose.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   Same thing with Audible.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.000]   I just said how much I love Audible, how I don't read many books in physical media anymore
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.680]   because I'm too busy doing audio books.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.520]   Oh, wait, no, Audible is not a sponsor.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   Yeah, so anyway, I love...
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   I love Audible books.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.000]   I mean, they're not a sponsor for the V personally.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.760]   There was a pretty good interview with one of the principals at the FDCs.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.400]   Like, look, everybody's freaking out, which is what the blogosphere does best, right?
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.480]   And basically what he said is the scumbag rule is in effect.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.280]   If the law was applied to people who are like, people who go out of there, people who are
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.600]   not, the most amazing thing about the Ford is that it's so wonderful and it's so this
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.480]   and it's so that and it's so, you know what I mean?
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.760]   And they want the blogger to basically be like, yeah, Ford gave me this car.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.840]   You know, and I hate that defense because it's so...
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.840]   It's the Patriot Act defense.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.680]   It's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   stop, stop.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.840]   This is not the Patriot Act.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.680]   The Patriot Act is one of the most scumbaggy, weasily, sad, empathetic pieces of...
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.840]   All right, let's pick a different one.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.600]   It's the seatbelt law defense then.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.160]   Oh, we're not going to pull you over for not wearing your seatbelts.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.160]   We're just going to...
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.760]   If we pull you over and we see that you don't have your seatbelt on, well, then we'll give
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   you a ticket.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.680]   You know, it's only, oh, we're not going to pull you over for that one thing.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.560]   Here it is, whenever you use, it's a slippery slope, and especially when you deal with
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.480]   government, I really dislike anything that has the little asterisk saying, but we're not
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.440]   really going to enforce it the way it says.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.880]   We won't misuse this.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.000]   It's like, this is how it begins.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   I don't like it.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I don't like it.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.960]   Okay, so basically bloggers and people on the internet should be able...
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.880]   And more importantly, marketing companies should be able to take advantage of all of
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.660]   the online media out there to sell whatever they want, however they want by pretending
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.440]   they are, whoever they want to pretend they are being honest on the interwebs, and there
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.840]   should be no recourse for the protection of consumers.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.520]   Oh, I'll not fall for your debate, Tom Pullery, my friends.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.000]   I'll avoid that trap.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.280]   The point is, is by the letter of the law, what it says, "I don't have $11,000 laying
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.520]   around, and I hate the idea that now that I'm my little tiny square inch of the public
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.360]   spotlight, I have to be careful about what I say as a result of this law."
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360]   It's driving me nuts.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.600]   I think that is totally reasonable.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.640]   It is totally reasonable to say, "Look.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.860]   You have a duty at the minimum to just be honest with people that if you're talking about
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.100]   a product because..."
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.100]   And it's not...
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.420]   I really don't believe that it's going to come down to like you mentioned Squarespace
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.220]   and you actually personally like them and they also happen to be a sponsor.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.100]   It's more like if Squarespace gave you 10 free accounts, right?
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.420]   If there was not an ad for them on your page, if they just said, "Here's 10 free accounts,"
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.420]   no reason.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.100]   And then you talk about how...
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.580]   Or flat out said, and some companies have.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.580]   Some companies have really said, "Here's a free car.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   Please talk about it."
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:13.200]   I think that these are the kinds of rules that could actually protect bloggers.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.660]   Like there was a big thing about mommy bloggers a couple years ago and it has been ongoing
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:23.020]   since where that became a really big lucrative segment of the blogging population and all
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.620]   of a sudden these mommy bloggers were getting inundated with free stuff and it was predatory.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.780]   I mean, they didn't know any better.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.260]   They're not journalists and I think that they were...
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.340]   A lot of journalists don't know any better, by the way.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.700]   A lot of journalists don't know any better either, exactly.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.300]   But I think on the one hand it can protect bloggers from being used by companies who
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.220]   are saying, "We want to use you for free publicity."
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.180]   And then on the other hand, I don't think there's anything wrong with basically saying
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.100]   you shouldn't be allowed to lie to the people who trust and like to read you.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.100]   Yeah, I totally agree.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.460]   I don't have a problem with this at all.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.140]   I mean, this disclosure has always been something that I've tried to do all the time.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.300]   I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, "I really like this thing," and oh,
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.220]   by the way, they've paid me junkets, review units.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.420]   All these things, I don't know.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.140]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.140]   I don't have a problem with it.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.700]   I think everybody should be doing it anyway.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.140]   And I don't have any problem with it being laid out in the law.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.180]   Yeah, I think it's a best effort kind of thing.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.740]   I don't think you have to be that scared.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.660]   Although, Brian maybe should be terrified.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.660]   I was about to say.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.740]   He's the guy who's going to deliver our next ad.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.740]   Everyone in the chat room has been wondering what this card I was handed just says and
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:31.340]   it says, "Schwood, we'll do audible platinum ad as I was warned five minutes ago."
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.340]   But it's true.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.820]   I mean, it's like, I guess it goes back and ties the room together real nicely, not unlike
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.820]   a certain rug.
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.540]   But I don't read a lot of physical books.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.340]   I'm glad you enjoy that.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.300]   And I don't because I'm doing audio books all the time.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.740]   I'm on the road 200 days out of the road.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.980]   And I chew through books because I do it all the time.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.260]   I do it while I'm doing chores around the house while I'm waiting in line for the TSA
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.820]   to manhandle me, except I take it out for TSA because you have to.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.940]   While I'm on the plane while I'm driving, this is all downtime.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.820]   This is when my brain would normally be in screen saver mode.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.940]   But instead, I'm able to experience all the best books out there.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.860]   And in fact, unlike Leo, because Leo talks about he makes it sound like he's the only
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.300]   crazy guy that listens to so many books per month, I'm right up there with him.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:26.940]   And that's why we're talking about the platinum edition, the platinum audible@audible.com/twit2.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.500]   You got to add the two in there.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   It looks like how many?
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:36.300]   Yeah, you get two free audio books to try it out or one Gigundo mega sized book as well.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.860]   And in fact, that's what I'm going to recommend because I am knee deep.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.580]   And I mentioned it earlier a little while ago, I'm actually, I'd never heard of Peter
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.820]   F. Hamilton.
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:50.180]   But I started reading Pandora's Star, which takes place 300 years in the future where
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.060]   in this, it's this kind of like, I don't know, it's a really neat world to sink your
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:00.420]   eyes into or your mental, your, your picture to picture yourself in because it's a world
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.260]   where every 60 or 70 years people go and they get a tune up.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.300]   And if essentially they reset their body back to 20 years old.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.700]   So as a result, you have this kind of epic tale that takes years and years.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.340]   I don't want to spoil too much about it.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.820]   It starts off so random and so bizarre.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:18.780]   But by the time it's over, you've experienced such an epic story that I'm actually onto
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.700]   the second series that takes place a thousand years after that.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.060]   And it actually has some of the same characters from the first one.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.140]   Pandora's Star is the first one is called the Commonwealth Saga.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:35.460]   You can choose it at audible.com/twit2 as one of your books on the platinum plant.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.180]   I sense a Kindle impulse buy in my future personally.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.180]   It's big.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.180]   Maybe it's a long one.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.660]   Maybe you can email me about that later.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.180]   All right, let's do the, let's do the wrap up real quick so that we don't get accused
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.740]   of doing an overlong twit.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.340]   Even though it's kind of short by Twit standard.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340]   It is kind of short.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.900]   I'm skipping ahead though because I just frankly, I only want to talk about Ralph Lauren going
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.420]   after Boing Bloin because of the Photoshop model.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:04.300]   This is my favorite story of the entire week and possibly the year.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.220]   And it doesn't get really good until you see the picture because I read it and I'm on
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.260]   a slow connection at this hotel.
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.340]   And so I'm actually reading the story and then halfway through the story, the picture
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.060]   shows up to my right and alone in my hotel room, I burst out laughing because I could
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.620]   not believe, I thought for sure this was a joke that somebody had.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.620]   I thought that the end of this was going to be, that was a bogus story because there's
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:30.460]   no way this cartoon stick figure could ever be thought to be intended as a real person.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.460]   A real human.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.460]   But then apparently it was.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.460]   They cop to it.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.500]   They admitted, yeah, that's supposed to be a person.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   Did you go like that?
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.020]   That made it through its editorial process.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.220]   It's yeah.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.580]   I was utterly dumbfounded and I think Zenny Chardon had maybe the best headline of the
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.100]   year too when she originally wrote it up and she said something about like they're now
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.620]   selling, oh, Ralph Lauren has opened up a new store in the uncanny valley.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.620]   Right?
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.620]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:02.500]   Like get that girl a webby just for that because it doesn't look like some sort of
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.140]   terrifying android creature.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:08.700]   And she just, she said, they showed up originally on what is it?
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.940]   Terrible Photoshop dot com or the Photoshop disasters.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.220]   And it was this ad where they had retouched this woman to the point where as Zenny put
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.460]   it, dude, her head's bigger than her pelvis.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.460]   It's true.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:25.020]   Like somebody in the chat room described her as looking like the alien at the end of close
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.020]   encounters of the third kind.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:32.940]   Siri, and then her one hand is like almost gone and then her, it is really just, it couldn't
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.260]   look less natural.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.180]   But so then rather than cop to it originally though, and this is where the story gets super
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:45.860]   awesome, Ralph Lauren came after boing boing and accused them of, oh, everybody's favorite
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.580]   club for the stupid copyright infringement.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   Yes.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.060]   For reprinting the ad.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.780]   They said you reprinted our intellectual property when you were making fun of this terrible
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.540]   editorial work that we've done here.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.540]   Right.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:01.420]   And placed that we placed in a public forum and now we're shocked, shocked that you're
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.580]   discussing it in a public forum.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.940]   The horror, the horror.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.140]   But they did eventually what Gina?
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.500]   It's such a, it's just such a great story.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   It was just delicious.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.220]   Everybody just kept getting better and better.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.220]   I know.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.220]   And I do that.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.220]   Frankly, I can't stop looking at the picture.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.460]   I want to move on and finish up, but I just can't.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.460]   It's hypnotic.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.460]   Try to look away.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460]   They did.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.700]   If I were that model, I'd be pissed.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.180]   I know, wouldn't you?
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.300]   Well, I'm so, you know what?
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.460]   I wonder how she felt before the controversy.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:32.220]   I wonder if she looked like that and just kind of went, all right, whatever.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.220]   Or if, or if she feels different now that it's sort of a big hubbub kind of thing.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.980]   I wonder, I wonder.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.940]   I want to meet her in person and just see.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.940]   I want that.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.260]   That's the real twist at the end of this story.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:49.020]   Ralph Lauren comes out and like, sorry, that's no Photoshop.
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:54.660]   What's funny though, it's like, okay, her pelvis is at an angle to the camera.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.580]   It's probably about 30, 40 degrees long.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.060]   Her chest and her head is directly facing the camera.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:04.660]   She's probably like five hand and 120 pounds, which is, I used to, I used to work in a part
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:10.760]   of Manhattan that was basically rife with modeling agencies and photographers' lofts
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.500]   up in the flat iron district.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:18.060]   And it was kind of, you know, being a squat little punk rock guy wearing his dad's leather
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.380]   jacket and pair of red kids surrounded by people wearing, you know, Armani suits back
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.860]   when Armani suits were a status symbol and not a punchline.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:32.900]   And models like walking to agencies, you could really feel like a small and squat and ugly
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.060]   and everyone else is wearing nice clothes and they're pretty tall.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.060]   This is how you want it to look.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.060]   It's what you're saying.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.060]   Just don't let them down.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   I don't think I know.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.220]   I've never really gone into the looking like a weird brook shields.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.100]   You wanted to be the meatball on a noodle.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.940]   That was your look you were going for.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:51.540]   I wanted to one of those beautiful suits in a Paris $2,000 handcrafted shoes or at least
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:57.500]   not to look like the one guy in the neighborhood that couldn't afford a really expensive car.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.780]   You know, I have since obviously matured.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:04.380]   I now live in hoodies and shorts and I am much happier for it.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.420]   But the, I don't know, man, I don't know.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.620]   Modeling in general is filled with people who are anatomically bizarre compared to the
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.620]   most of the population.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.620]   Come on though.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.620]   True.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.620]   There are limit.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.620]   I mean, that's totally true.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.620]   Although there are limits.
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.980]   There, I definitely seen the people that you're talking about where you question how they
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.940]   could even exist really, but this is like terrifying.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:29.580]   Anyway, Ralph Lauren did eventually cave to the fairly obvious argument that in fact
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:35.540]   that was not copyright infringement and are you crazy and then said, okay, you're right.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.300]   As it turns out, we have learned, we have learned that we are responsible for the poor
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.180]   imaging and retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman's body.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:50.020]   Not like, I don't even think you need to worry about little girls seeing this and feeling
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.580]   like that, you know, they need to lose weight.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.340]   I think you have to worry about them seeing this and having nightmares.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.900]   Well, what do they say?
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.340]   Like they even went all the way around and said the very distorted image.
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.300]   It wasn't even like, uh, but she's too thin for you guys.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.220]   You know, it's like they acknowledge like, yeah, that's a, that's a freak.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:12.740]   I've got a friend who is a counselor and a dietician that works with children with eating
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.900]   disorders.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:20.180]   And you know, when you talk to somebody who deals day in and day out with teenagers and
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:27.380]   younger who have completely destroyed any normal relationship they have with their body
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:32.060]   image, you know, because of, of, you know, they, them wanting to be the advertising or
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:36.220]   some extreme, distorted version of it as it gets filtered through their psyche.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.220]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.380]   Like on one hand, like, you know, you kiss my ass Ralph Lauren.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.140]   I mean, you know, yeah, it's war, photoshopping, you're submitting it, but it's, but it's,
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.060]   it's the entire industry.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.060]   It's Hollywood.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.980]   It's the expectations everybody has.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:55.580]   And it's, it's brutal to anybody who doesn't exactly fit into that for a lot of people.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.660]   It's, it's a bummer that it takes a case like this.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.820]   Like it's, it's a bummer that Ralph Lauren actually did this on purpose because otherwise
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:07.100]   this is a great topic of discussion to bring about, about how ridiculous the imagery is
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.460]   that they're putting out there.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.460]   Right.
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.900]   So three cheers for Dove soap.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.540]   Yeah, that was the best viral video.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.700]   Yeah, that's good stuff.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.700]   I know.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.700]   Absolutely.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.660]   I'm thinking of the print ads they did on all the bus stops and stuff for around here.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.300]   And it was interesting to watch people react to that.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.460]   Like, you know, the she's not very skinny.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.380]   And it's just like, well, yeah, it's the whole point of the ad, dude.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.380]   It's like irony.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.260]   And you're just living too close.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.260]   That don't seem right to me.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.860]   That billboard.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   Not sure why.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860]   All right.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.420]   I think we're going to call it there.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.260]   And I am really excited about the, okay, well, first, I promise that I would do this
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.260]   earlier.
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.140]   And now here we go is Pimping Tom.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.860]   Brian Brushwood, what are you working on?
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.860]   One of my pimping.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:50.860]   I'm Pimping scam school.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.380]   The only show dedicated to social engineering at the bar and on the street at scam school
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:16:00.020]   dot TV and my little weekly train wreck at the bbliveshow.com terrible, terrible show.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.020]   Nobody should watch it at bbliveshow.com.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.180]   Your first elevator pitch is a lot better than your second.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.380]   But my second is a lot more honest.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.580]   Gina, you've had the whole show to prepare.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.780]   What are you pimping?
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:18.220]   I am pimping my other Twitch show that I co-host with Jeff Jarvis and Leo when he gets back.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.260]   This week in Google, it airs on Saturdays at 2.15 p.m.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.900]   Pacific Times, you can catch it here.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:29.260]   And I'm also disclosing all of my sponsorships at smorterware.org where I blog when I'm
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.660]   feeling good.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.660]   What are you doing?
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.580]   You're feeling bad?
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.580]   I don't blog.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.580]   I don't blog.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.220]   It accepts gifts in exchange for positive blogs.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.980]   I accept gifts and then, you know, compose blog posts with full disclosures.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:49.260]   Patrick Gordon, what are you working on?
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.260]   Texts, as usual and what else?
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.740]   Texts, with the fabulous Veronica Belmont.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:58.660]   We're the Mickey Mouse Club for Geeks, except I didn't say Mickey Mouse because then Disney
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.820]   would sue me, so we're an enthusiast for technology.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.820]   Yes.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.780]   Colleen's gonna bleep that later in the download.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.780]   Thank you, Colleen.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.660]   And by the way, fabulous new haircut, Colleen.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.860]   And of course, HD Nation with Robert Aaron, so we're all HD all the time, whether it's
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:19.100]   your Surround San Home Theater, Stereo System, the best new content, weekly Blu-ray releases.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.540]   We love our home theaters.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.340]   That's why you're so wedded to DVDs right now.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:28.540]   No, I'm wedded actually to something I double checked, right?
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:34.380]   You know, Netflix has 12 million subscriptions and there are something like 60, 70, 80 million
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.260]   households with DVD players out there.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.260]   You know what I mean?
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:44.180]   It wasn't until 2006 that there were more homes with DVD players in them than VCRs.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.780]   So the option curve, you guys gotta remember, the consumer adoption curve is very, very
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.980]   slow for most of the world, or at least the United States.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Anyhow, revisions through to Comps. HD Nation.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.620]   I was like, oh crap, I accidentally reopened a discussion.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.620]   What was I thinking?
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.860]   Well, thank you for getting out of here, Molly.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.180]   We're all going to die.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.940]   In case you were out there thinking, who is that person and where did she come from?
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:11.500]   I am an executive editor at cnettv.com where I host a show called the Buzz Report.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.060]   It's kind of like the daily show for technology news.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.740]   And I have a new show called CNET Conversations because every time I'm on Leo goes, what are
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.740]   you doing that's new?
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.340]   And it makes me feel like a loser.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:24.020]   This time I have a new show called CNET Conversations where myself and a colleague from news.com
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.620]   interview a really important person in technology.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.620]   We've talked to Anish Chopra, the federal CTO, and then our latest interview is Steve Balmer.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   Wow.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.900]   Yeah, that lines up right now at cnettv.com/
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:35.900]   Hollywood.
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:36.900]   Plus Conversations.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.900]   And yes, he is scary.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.980]   I was about to say, is he physically intimidating?
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   Yes.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   Wow.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:46.300]   We will talk about that in the post show because another Twit is in the can.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:53.300]   [Music]
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:19:08.300]   [Music]
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.460]   (upbeat music)
