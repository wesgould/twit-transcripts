[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.740]   I guess once December happened,
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.500]   we had to decorate the studio if you're not watching a video.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.420]   Just imagine me raised in garlands with glitter in my hair.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.140]   No, no, glitter's bad.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.220]   No glitter in my hair, tinsel in my toes.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.100]   We're gonna have a fun Twit today.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.460]   In fact, frankly, I'm just gonna sit back
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.260]   and let these guys take over 'cause Rocket West
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.780]   from the Rocket podcast, Christina Warren.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.260]   Film Girl is here, senior cloud developer advocate
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.340]   at Microsoft.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.180]   Hi, Christina.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.620]   - Hello, hi Leo, thanks for having me.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.460]   - Always good.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.020]   - And since it is the holiday season,
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.860]   I'm wearing because this is proof
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.980]   that Facebook advertising actually works
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.500]   on some people, i.e. me.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.980]   This is the most brilliant connection in the test.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.500]   - Don't tell me, pull down the lower third
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.340]   so I could see.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.780]   It looks like some sort of emo band.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.620]   - Yep.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.300]   - I don't know, who is that?
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   - It says the OC, Mary Christmica.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.580]   (laughing)
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.740]   - Oh, it's a TV show, I see.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.220]   - Yes, it's been off the air for a decade.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.060]   - Wow.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.140]   - But there was a Facebook thing last year about it
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.740]   and I was like, I have to have this.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.580]   - I fall for this too.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.020]   - I'm just supposed to, this is the most Christina shirt ever
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.900]   but it was the holidays
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.300]   and I was like, I have to wear this on to it.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.100]   - I fall for that every time.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.620]   Those ads just get me.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.660]   And she also has a movie poster from Clueless
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.140]   behind her, beautifully framed.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.980]   - I do.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.820]   - Yeah.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.660]   - Yes.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.340]   - So you know she's living in the 90s baby.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.180]   (laughing)
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.180]   - Always, always.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.020]   Ever seen.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.860]   (laughing)
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.580]   - Also with us from Rocket, Brianna Wu,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.460]   co-founder of Giant Spacecat Canada
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.340]   for Congress in the Massachusetts fourth,
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.180]   is it fourth?
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.020]   I always forget the number.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.860]   - Is the eighth.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.700]   - It's district.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.540]   - Twice as good as the number.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.380]   - So if you go down to South Station.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.220]   - If you want to vote for Brianna
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.540]   in the fourth district as well.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.580]   - For every district.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580]   (laughing)
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.420]   - Do they count from the.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.180]   - I don't think it works like that
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.300]   but I'll take over it there if I have to.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.220]   We can do that.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.620]   - Brianna Wu 2018.com.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.960]   And since we're doing Rocket,
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.540]   Simone is not with us
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.820]   but playing the role of Simone de Roche foreign today's episode.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.140]   Sam Bullsmid who is a, of course,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.420]   our car guy, senior analyst at Navigant Research
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.260]   but also our expert on all things automotive.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.260]   It's great to see you, Sam.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.020]   And he has his own podcast called,
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.860]   I always forget.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.700]   - Wheel bearings.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.540]   - Wheel bearings.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.380]   - Wheel bearings.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.220]   - That media.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.700]   - It's all about cars and Sam's here
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.140]   because tomorrow in the wine country,
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.180]   Nissan is gonna demonstrate their new leaf electric vehicle,
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.900]   the 2018 Leaf which comes up for sale next month.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.740]   - Yep.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.500]   - And actually it was really great.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.980]   Sam got Nissan to bring one down.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.620]   We did a segment for Saturday's new screensavers,
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.420]   took a ride and everything.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.260]   Pretty impressed.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.900]   I'm excited and we've talked to Brianna before
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.220]   about electric vehicles.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.460]   Brianna is aggressively, she's an ice person.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.380]   Internal combustion engine all the way
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.340]   just bought a Porsche Cayman.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.420]   - I did, I did.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.740]   Yeah, when they put out a good electric vehicle,
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.220]   I will be the first to buy one.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.820]   They have a lot of great dynamics,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.860]   like celery quicker.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.100]   It's just, you know, the Tesla, it's a four-door car
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.860]   and I'm just not that into coupe vehicles, you know?
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.700]   - I understand.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   - I understand.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.620]   We're gonna call Sam Simone, if you don't mind,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.460]   for the show.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.300]   - I'm gonna guess.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.140]   - I'm gonna call him before us.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.660]   I would be honored to be called that.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.500]   - We actually-- - We don't expect me
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.020]   to do her voiceovers.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.500]   - No, she's good.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.340]   - Excuse me.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.460]   - If I could hire Simone to do my ads,
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.540]   I would just sit back and listen.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.380]   (laughing)
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.220]   Sit back and listen.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.260]   Should we start big or should we start small?
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260]   I just, I can't decide.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.460]   Cyber Monday was last Monday,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.820]   the biggest cyber Monday ever,
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.300]   the biggest shopping day ever,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.680]   even besting Amazon Prime, at least for online.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.780]   Amazon said the Prime Day back in July,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.540]   which had set the previous record was surpassed
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.580]   by Cyber Monday.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.740]   I don't see any numbers on this.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.700]   - Yeah, which was interesting.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   Yeah, Amazon didn't release any numbers.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.980]   This is just completely anecdotal.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.060]   I can only speak for myself,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.340]   but I weirdly, I didn't buy much,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.340]   either Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.900]   I did get a bed and a new mattress on Cyber Monday.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.700]   - I hope it was a casper, that's all I can say.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   Don't say if it's not, you better not say, don't say.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.100]   - I'm not, I'm not gonna comment.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.140]   - Even Simone can't overcome that, just, you know.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.140]   - I understand, so I'm not commenting.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.220]   (laughing)
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.180]   I just did get a new bed and a new mattress,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.740]   but I didn't really buy anything else.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.820]   And I didn't see some of this spectacular deals,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.460]   but maybe I just wasn't looking,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.700]   maybe I already have everything.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.100]   What about you, did you guys buy anything else?
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.060]   - Well, I think one of the reasons Amazon did so well
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.620]   is 'cause they so drastically discounted the Echo devices.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.460]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.260]   - And that was the number one seller it always is.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.020]   That's one of the things that's really shaping up
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.620]   this holiday season is a battle between Amazon
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.020]   and the Echo and Google and its home.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.380]   And unfortunately, Apple is not in the battle,
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.500]   it wanted to be, but the HomePod is delayed till next year.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.300]   And I actually have an Echo Dot that I was gifted
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.740]   about a year ago, and when I got it, I took it out of the box,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.900]   plugged it in, played with it for about 10 minutes
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.780]   and then stuck in the drawer and it's never been plugged in
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.860]   since, because I found that I actually have no use
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.700]   for these devices.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.620]   - You just didn't give it more time.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.060]   And I think what happens is you've come up with uses
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.700]   over a period of time.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.620]   - You know, I actually don't mind getting up
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.460]   to hit a light switch to not a light switch.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.300]   - Oh, it's not!
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.140]   It's insane!
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.500]   Look, what can I say?
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.340]   You know, what I do, I do use voice controls on my phone.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.060]   You know, I've got a Pixel XL.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.780]   And, you know, ever since I had my first Moto X
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.260]   several years ago, I've used, you know,
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.740]   Hello Moto or, you know, okay, so you're--
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.980]   - So you're used to talking to your phone?
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.700]   - Yeah, I talk to my phone all the time, you know,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.940]   to set reminders for myself, set timers and things like that.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.260]   - I miss the Moto X had one feature that I don't know
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.460]   why these other guys don't do it.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.980]   You could set the trigger word to anything you want.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.300]   I made my-- - Yeah, that is one
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.120]   of the most obvious-- - Help me,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.360]   I know, because that way it wouldn't be triggered
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.000]   by anything, I could easily remember it.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   And plus it gave me a kind of thrill every time I said it.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.040]   Why can't we do that with these better, more modern devices?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.280]   Why do we have to choose from their limited supply of trigger words?
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.840]   - They should be capable of doing that.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.640]   I'd like to have something besides all of a game.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.360]   - Well, I know I hate it.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.000]   And it's a problem for us because we can't talk about--
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.920]   - Right, we can't use the-- - Right,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.440]   we can't use the-- - Madam A word,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.600]   we can't use the S word, we can't use any of the words.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.720]   And for all of the people watching, if I just triggered your--
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.560]   - Yeah, you're out of-- - Devices,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.480]   I'm sorry, I'm gonna make sure.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.000]   'Cause I know how many times I've been annoyed over the years
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.400]   when I've been in my car, and Ron Richards would say,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.640]   "Oh, we'll get you a--" - It's a pro--
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   You did it again!
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.480]   - Oh, my-- - I'm sorry.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.000]   - It's a pretty bad habit.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.840]   And then-- - It's embarrassing
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   to have everybody's devices go off.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.480]   - Would go into that mode.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.520]   - I did, y'all see, like as you were driving around,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.280]   did you see many people out actually buying things this year?
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.560]   'Cause Lisa was talking about this.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.360]   And the mall nearest to my current house, it was--
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.440]   I mean, there were people out there shopping,
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.560]   but it wasn't as packed as it usually is.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.520]   And I'm wondering if we're getting to a tipping point
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   where more people are saying, "You know what,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.960]   "I don't need to go to the mall,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.720]   "I don't need to go into meat space."
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.640]   Like, let's actually just get all this stuff on Amazon,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.400]   'cause the deals are so consistently good every year.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.440]   - I'll go a step farther.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.800]   I think not only are people buying more online
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.520]   to the point where we are probably very close to 50/50
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.800]   if it's not tipped.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   What's really interesting to me,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   and you saw this in singles day in China,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.800]   and you see it to some degree here
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.760]   on Black Friday and Cyber Monday,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.920]   not just online, but on mobile.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.040]   People are shopping on their phones, which is a kind of--
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.360]   Would you, Christina, would you do that?
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.880]   Would you shop on your phone?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.720]   - Oh yeah.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.440]   - Would you buy a mattress on your phone?
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   - I did.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.200]   - See, I bought stuff on my phone.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.800]   - I did, through Amazon, but I did.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.720]   I mean, and other things, I mean, at this point,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.600]   you go to what device are you on most frequently?
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.480]   For me, I'm most frequently on my phone,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.120]   so it makes more sense to do that.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.600]   I will say, I do think, I agree with you, Leo.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   I think that if we're not already at the tipping point,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.080]   we're probably really close,
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   but I was surprised, maybe it's just Seattle,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.640]   but on Black Friday, we were driving to meet a friend
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.400]   downtown, and so we had to go through
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   where the flagship Nordstrom is,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.680]   and there are a bunch of other stores,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.640]   and the traffic and the call of people was insane.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.600]   It took us a really long time to get to the restaurant
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200]   that we were going to, and on Thursday, on Thanksgiving,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.600]   I mean, we happened to go by, and again,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.520]   it was a best buy, so I mean, it's a different thing,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.560]   but there were people at five o'clock at night
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.880]   lined up around the block,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.520]   and I don't know what time the store was opening,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.440]   probably eight or nine, but people were,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.920]   I mean, it was going around and around,
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.440]   it was a big shopping district,
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.160]   so I do think that maybe it's just these big events
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.200]   that bring people out, 'cause I do think that
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.800]   by and large, most people are,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.360]   I don't know, I'm like, I won't even go,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.720]   I'm not gonna wait in line to save an extra $20,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.080]   I'd rather, or go to a store to save it,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.160]   wait in line, you know, in a store to save $20,
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   let's just buy it online.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.760]   - Let me wax. - But I do think,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.560]   pardon me?
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.800]   - Let me wax philosophical.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.640]   - Sure.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.200]   - So until very recently,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.720]   if you had a man-made artifact,
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.840]   it was a special thing.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.520]   People might have one book, or probably no books,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.120]   or for rich people.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.400]   If you, everybody slept in the same bed,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.680]   'cause beds were so expensive,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.520]   you might have one pot,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.720]   you might have a candlestick.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.240]   It's only recently, we now have any one of us--
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.080]   - It's the one of us-- - It's the one
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.920]   of us-- - It's the one of us.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.760]   - It's the century phenomenon.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.600]   - Every, any, it is.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.240]   Any one of us has more artifacts, man-made things,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.680]   person-made things in our lives,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.800]   than a whole country might have had 200 years ago.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.760]   It's a post-industrial revolution phenomenon.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   The ability to mass-manufacture goods,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.800]   in high quantities, with relatively high levels of quality,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.040]   at very low cost,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.960]   has enabled everybody to have,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.080]   or enabled most people to have,
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.120]   almost anything they want.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.080]   - Does that improve the standard of living or not?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.240]   Is that a better thing than,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.560]   I have my little rag doll with the pain on face--
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.720]   - It's changed. - That's a special object.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   It's changed it.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.520]   I don't know that it's certainly improved things
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.800]   in a lot of ways.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   I mean, you have, for the most part,
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.480]   you have far fewer people starving,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.240]   than you would have in the early 19th century.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.440]   - That's true, life expectancy's doubled.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.040]   - It doubled specteries, but there are a lot
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.680]   of downsides to it as well,
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   as we are increasingly seeing,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.040]   especially now, with the influence of social media
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   on our own wellbeing, our mental wellbeing.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.400]   I know my wife, for example,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.560]   the stress that she feels when looking at Facebook now,
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.960]   and seeing the reports of what's going on in politics,
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.560]   raises her blood pressure,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   and I know it doesn't--
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   - Yeah, it's very stressful this world we live in.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   - Yeah. - Go ahead, Brianna.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.920]   - I don't, well, I was just gonna say,
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.240]   I think that, I do think that things are more commoditized.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.800]   Like, we're talking like a Tesla,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.960]   that's never gonna be as rare a thing as,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.600]   like I'm looking at buying a Porsche 930.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.160]   This is a really classic one from the 80s and 90s.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.480]   You're not gonna have that in the same way.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.160]   So I do think, it's like Marco Arment on our network.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.960]   He really got into old style physical watches,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.600]   because it was the exact opposite of an Apple watch.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.840]   Like something meticulously made by hand.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.360]   So I know for me, part of the reason why I really enjoy,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.320]   you know, like painting my own car
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.680]   is because it's such an opposite experience
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.920]   of the world we live in, where everything is so commoditized,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.400]   something you really make and maintain yourself.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   It's almost magical in 2017,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.320]   because we don't ever get to do it.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.040]   - There's also the issue of crap.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.880]   So a lot of, we've got to the point where,
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.600]   this is such an engine that has such a motive force
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   that we, every company, Apple's a good example,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.440]   every company needs to make more stuff.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.200]   And if a company doesn't have ideas
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.000]   for the next thing that's new and innovative,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.320]   they just recombine.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.560]   So I just got this, and it's actually not a new product.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.840]   This is a mouse, it's called a Skype mouse.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.360]   It has built into it a speaker and a microphone
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.840]   and a little DACs, you plug into the USB port,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.720]   suddenly the sound starts coming, it sounds tinny,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.520]   but it comes out of the mouse,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.600]   and I can make phone calls into my mouse.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.960]   That's the example of crap,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.760]   what I mean by crap is there's nothing innovative in this.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.640]   They just, it's like recombinant DNA.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.800]   They just took three different parts,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.120]   threw them together and said,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.880]   "Let's see what happens with this."
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   And I feel like a lot of what we're looking at
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.560]   in the marketplace is that, it's not truly innovative,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.680]   it's just recombined, randomly recombined parts.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.880]   - Earlier this year, my wife and I moved,
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.720]   and our kids were growing and out of the house,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   and so we took the opportunity to do a huge purge,
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   and I was amazed at how much stuff we ended up throwing away
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.040]   in the course of doing that move.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.920]   And after two weeks of packing stuff
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.120]   and getting it out of the house,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.560]   there's still all the closets and everything
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.640]   still seem to be packed with stuff.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   It was like our house was a giant Tetris puzzle
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.920]   with stuff packed into every new community.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   - It's a good feeling though when you get rid of it.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.280]   - Oh yeah, I mean it was amazing
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.720]   to get rid of all this stuff and get it out of it.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.520]   - I don't wanna project, but I did,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.720]   we recently had fires here as you know,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.880]   in Sonoma County, and a lot of people,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.520]   hundreds, I think 1500 people lost their homes.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.800]   And it was pretty terrible.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.200]   - Yeah, it's the worst, 4,500?
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.560]   Wow, so it's the worst you could even imagine, right?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.400]   But a surprisingly large number of them
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.840]   seemed to be pretty complacent with the whole thing.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.200]   Like, oh, thank God, I got rid of all that crap.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   As long as you and your pets survived.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   - Now I don't have to go to Home Depot
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.760]   and get a couple of bags to control the footage.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.600]   - It was a kind of a purge.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.080]   I mean, I'm not speaking for everybody.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.120]   I know that's been a devastating thing.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.320]   But I was kind of noticing that a lot of people
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   were kind of okay with that.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.240]   I got insurance.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.560]   And I wonder how many of them will replace one for one
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.800]   all the crap they got just got rid of.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   - I think something-- - I know if it happened to me,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.840]   I certainly wouldn't get replaced most of the stuff.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.360]   - Yeah, I'm not advocating it now.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   - I think something with the,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.920]   when I travel so much these days,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.400]   you really get used to your entire life being
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.360]   like a MacBook and everything that you can fit in the bag.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   Because there's some-- - There's some footage.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.880]   - There's no parts of last year.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.200]   I was living off a suitcase like almost a third of the year.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   Like, Christina, how many shows do I deal with you
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.120]   last year when I was on the road?
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.400]   - Get so many. - It changes.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.560]   - Yeah, it changes your perception of what you really need.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   - You might need a Skype mouse 'cause listen,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   I'm gonna now, music comes out of it.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.800]   - Of course, it's coming.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   - Oh, so--
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.280]   - You know, these how microphones really don't do that
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.360]   in justice, it sounds so much better in person.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   - You're coming up with--
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.440]   (laughing)
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.640]   - Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.600]   - No, I agree with you, Bree.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.680]   I am, when we moved to Seattle,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.760]   we were in corporate housing for the first two months.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.160]   And so we only had like limited things with us
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.600]   and all of our stuff was in storage.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.840]   And my husband and I both kind of discussed,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.040]   we were like, we didn't really miss that many things.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.600]   And so, I mean, I got rid of a lot of clothes
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.200]   when we went through that.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.360]   It's gonna be harder to get rid of some other things.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.680]   - Are you gonna do Con-Marie,
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.560]   are you gonna ask if-- - I was gonna say,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.880]   the Marie Koto stuff, people, I've read that book
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.920]   and I'm a messy person and I should, but that's just--
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.600]   - I read it too. - It's a good idea theory.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.280]   I just know. - That's all I did.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.160]   I just read them.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.280]   You're supposed to look at everything in your life
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.400]   and say, does this Skype mouse spark?
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.120]   What does it spark joy?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.080]   - Yeah, yeah. - Does it spark joy?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.520]   And if it does, you keep it and if it doesn't,
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.440]   you just get rid of it.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.840]   Actually, it sparks some joy.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.680]   I confess. - That's the thing.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   That's where the thing breaks down
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.240]   is if you're someone like me who is--
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.000]   - Everything sparks joy. - If you're a footer
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.120]   and a selector, the--
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.880]   - That's good. - You're a joyful person.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.240]   You're having a great time in life.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.160]   Nothing wrong with that. - Yeah, but Christina,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.960]   don't you feel our life is filled with junk?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.160]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.440]   But at the same time-- - You should see my office.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.240]   I can't even get into my office 'cause I can't--
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.000]   No, every surface is covered with something.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.440]   - My office right now, I was embarrassed by
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.520]   and it's still a mess and I've had to put stuff
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   in the closet and I've been in this place
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.960]   for like four months. - But I know
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.880]   you have a recycling bin, so put everything in there.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.200]   - No, I mean, there's just so much.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.560]   I mean, look, I wanna get rid of a lot of stuff,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.960]   but there's a lot of stuff.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.800]   But like on my desk right now, you guys can't see it,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   but I have the Japanese Super Nintendo Famicom.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.160]   I have a Twitterific bird from like 2008.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.720]   I have a 3DS XL, I have two computers.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   I have-- - I could beat you.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.120]   I tell you. - I'm vaguely like my--
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.040]   - Oh, I have an Amazon Fire controller.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.320]   - Oh, God. - Oh, God.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   - Oh, Christina.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.200]   - They're making bad choices.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.600]   - Guys, this is not a bad choice.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.440]   This is amazing.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.080]   Look, I have a Game Boy Mini-- - Oh, I have that, yeah.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.800]   - A Game Boy Advance SP with old games
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   and also old Game Boy Color games.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.120]   - That's the last time you played that.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.760]   - Probably 2004.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.640]   (laughing)
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.480]   Probably.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.320]   (laughing)
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.760]   - Those things are worth a lot, you know.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.560]   I think the battery still works.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.680]   - You need to do an intervention with Chris David.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.000]   - Oh, without a-- (laughing)
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.400]   - Money. - Can I tell y'all
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.880]   the worst story about being a bad wife?
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.560]   I was so embarrassed about this.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.040]   So my husband is a pack rat.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.440]   He just is.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   He loves to collect stuff and we've moved five times
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.600]   since we've been married and we are gang-rate
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.680]   to move to a nice house in our district
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.200]   where we can hold dinners to bring people over and fundraise.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   And he left a window open downstairs in our basement
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   and it rained and it got all over all of his books.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.840]   - Oh no. - Now we have two floors
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.160]   to this house and downstairs is just nothing
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.120]   but Frank junk and he had to throw about 80% of it away.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.480]   And I was so thrilled.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.640]   I was so sick of it.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.960]   (laughing)
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.280]   So I wasn't gonna have to move all his books
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.760]   from the 70s again 'cause I've done it so many times.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.680]   - I knew my last marriage was over when I found my
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.840]   20 volume Oxford English Dictionary
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.080]   on the floor in the garage.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.840]   My wife said, "Do you need me to make some space?"
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.280]   - No. - Oh yeah?
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   Has that thing ever worked?
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.440]   - Yeah, this is an Uyah.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.800]   - You have an Uyah?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.240]   - I have an Uyah on my desk.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.640]   This was literally on my desk.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.480]   - Oh my God.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   - Okay, you win.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.320]   - You win.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.160]   - I have to say, I just won.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.000]   I just won. - I just won.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.280]   - I found this on my desk.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.640]   - Uyah was an Android device.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.920]   Actually the company that made Uyah is now making
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.760]   something new.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.600]   What do they do?
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.440]   - Well, didn't they get bought by Razer?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.440]   - Yeah, Razer. - Yeah.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.360]   - Uyah, oh that's right.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.640]   The Razer phone is a combination of the next bit
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.320]   Robin and the Uyah teams got together to make a phone.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.640]   So you could get the phone and get rid of two objects
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.480]   on your desk.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.360]   - So it's like Kickstarter failures combined to--
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.720]   I had the Robin phone.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.440]   I'm sure I've given that to somebody by now,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.640]   the next bit Robin the phone.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.720]   All right, I don't know why I got so philosophical here.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.760]   I just, here we are, we're getting close to the holiday
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.000]   season, people are gonna, you know,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.600]   there's Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.800]   people are gonna go out, buy a lot more crap.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.760]   And I don't know, maybe we could just think
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.360]   of something else to do.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.960]   I'm just trying to get out of buying presents.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.120]   - I'm proud of myself this year that the only thing
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.840]   I bought at any point during that week
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   was a couple of extra USB-C phone docs
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.720]   to put it on the house that were on sale
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.800]   for like $7 on Amazon.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.640]   - That's very practical.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.320]   Would you be interested in a Skype mouse?
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.160]   - No, not at all.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.880]   (laughing)
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.720]   Not even remotely.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.920]   - But you can make Skype calls on it.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.080]   - I've heard that, yes.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.920]   - Okay.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   And I've also heard what it sounds like.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.760]   - I'm so I like it.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.400]   (laughing)
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.320]   - All right, let's take a little break.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.720]   - Can you record podcasts on it though?
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.560]   - You could, you could.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.960]   I'm, you know what, isn't that be,
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.720]   so we spend so much time and energy on a perfect audio chain
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   and the PR40 mics and, you know, processing stuff.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.880]   Would it be funny if I just did a show on this?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.140]   And it would sound like old time radio.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.960]   It'd be kind of cool.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.840]   I'm thinking maybe I should do my next show.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.680]   I'll do all that.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.160]   - The next time you do a segment
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.320]   on the incomparable radio theater,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.080]   there we are broadcasting from 1935.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.880]   You know what they didn't have in 1935?
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   They really ought to have had Casper mattresses.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.680]   - Life would have been when, in the Godfather,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.840]   when they went to the mattresses,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.160]   they could have just saved themselves a lot of trouble,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.440]   just have a bunch of Caspers sent to the hideout.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.520]   - Like the house is open.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.200]   - Yes, it comes open, it smells great, it's comfy.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.920]   They would have never gotten off the mattresses.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.000]   They would have just said, "Hey, forget the gang battle.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.880]   "Let's just all stay here."
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.200]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.440]   for a fraction of the cost, and they are awesome.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.520]   I actually have the new Casper, the Wave mattress.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.800]   It features a natural geometry support system
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.440]   and a new top layer.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.000]   They are expanding their line, yeah.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.480]   So these guys obsessively engineer their mattresses,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.440]   make many, many prototypes, try all sorts of things.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.920]   What they're going for is something everybody wants.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   A mattress that seems a contradiction in terms,
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.600]   but a mattress that you sink into, right?
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.480]   So your hard bits, your hips and stuff sink right into it,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.160]   but yet is firm so it supports your back.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.280]   Oh, and by the way, as long as we're doing that,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.520]   let's make it breathable so it sleeps cool,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.380]   so you never get overheated.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.200]   Then you're going to have the perfect night sleep.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.280]   Well, Casper's done it.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.120]   They've combined multiple supportive memory foams
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.760]   with different characteristics,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.600]   so it does, in fact, you sink into it,
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.320]   but it does support you.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.520]   It sleeps cool, it smells great.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.640]   It's the first mattress I ever bought
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.000]   that I didn't have to air out for a week
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.920]   before we slept on it.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.560]   It's just incredible.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.280]   Soft, comfortable, and you buy it directly from Casper,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.800]   which means you eliminate the worst part
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.080]   of the mattress equation, which is that middleman,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.480]   at the mattress store where they mark it up 100%,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.800]   and they do it because people say,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.760]   "Oh, no, I have to go fly on at the mattress
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.320]   "or to choose my mattress."
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.800]   You cannot choose a mattress lying on at a mattress store.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.040]   You can't.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.280]   You needed to lie on it at home
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.120]   and you need to sleep on it,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.480]   and you need to sleep on it for many nights.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.800]   In fact, with Casper, you could sleep on it
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.720]   for 100 nights, and if at any time in the first 100 nights,
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.480]   you say, "Yeah, it's not for me."
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.440]   They will come, they will get it,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   they will turn every penny, no cost to you.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.560]   It is as easy as can be.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.200]   The mattress come in a great box,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.000]   compact box, free shipping, and returns to the US,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.760]   to Canada, now to the UK.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.200]   Take a look at the regular, the traditional mattress,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.840]   and the new Casper Wave mattress.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.000]   And on either, you can save $50
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.360]   by going to Casper.com/twit.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.840]   Use our promo code, Twitter, check out Casper.com/twit.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.200]   Don't forget the promo code,
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.520]   Twit, Terms and Conditions Supply,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.800]   Casper.com/twit.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.000]   It's so nice.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.080]   I love these new modern mattresses.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.880]   It really is a revolution, and you know what?
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.120]   Maybe how much better is sleep on it?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.560]   You know what really is happening?
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.920]   And Casper does this, but I think of Warby Parker
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.760]   and Harry's and Dollar Shave Club,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.040]   is that entrepreneurs are smart,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.000]   they're looking for a situation
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.440]   where the middleman isn't working,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   where the markups are too high,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.640]   the experience of the consumer isn't good enough,
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.960]   and they're saying we can fix that with e-commerce.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.040]   And when it really works, it really, really works.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.880]   It's awesome.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.400]   We had a kind of interesting Tuesday,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.800]   Mac break weekly, we're sitting there
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.720]   and all of a sudden somebody's tweets.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.560]   (laughing)
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   - Oh no. - You know.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.000]   - Oh.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.440]   - You can log into a Mac,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.000]   you can change settings in a Mac
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.520]   just by using the root account with a no password.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.000]   Renee Richie, and there, and Andy and I,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.560]   we went what?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.080]   And Patrick, our programmer Patrick Delaney tried,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.120]   he said, "That's right, it's true."
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.840]   And then Renee tried and I tried it,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.000]   and we, what the hell, how could this happen?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.240]   This is high Sierra, the new Apple Mac OS.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.400]   They, first of all, on Mac's traditionally,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.880]   the root account is not active.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.840]   So they activated it.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.160]   And then, because it had no password,
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.600]   it was weird though, because the first time
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.280]   it might not work, but the second time it worked,
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.200]   or the third time it worked.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.880]   So you had to try a few times.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.040]   I quickly was able to go onto my Mac,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.840]   give the root account a password,
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   just open terminal and type pseudo P-A-S-W-D,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.240]   password root, give it a new password, and that fixed it.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.440]   But then Apple, well, yeah, Apple pushed out a fix
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.160]   on Thursday, which was more sophisticated.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.960]   Then they pushed out an update to high Sierra
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.680]   that broke the fix.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.560]   - Yep.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.600]   - What the hell?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.160]   - Well, I mean, what this goes to demonstrate is that
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.960]   it's, no matter how good your intentions are,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.880]   how hard you try, it's virtually impossible
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.240]   to guarantee absolute security in a complex electronic system.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.920]   And whether it's, I mean, Apple is as good
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.240]   as any company out there doing this stuff.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.800]   And if they can't get it right, who can?
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.960]   And just think about, we've seen all these things,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.600]   the Mariah Botnet with IoT devices,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.640]   and now we're getting into automated and connected cars,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.320]   I mean, the potential for what can go wrong there
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.120]   just explodes exponentially.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.520]   - So we're screwed.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   Pretty much, yeah.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.640]   - Yeah, I have to say, it came broken later.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.040]   I had a different read on that.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.880]   I think anyone that's dealt with a development team
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.760]   has checked files in and accidentally overwritten,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.080]   like your coworkers work,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   especially something it's done hastily.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.520]   - They need a better subversion system.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.360]   - Sure.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.520]   - Version control, these are for us.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.760]   - Yeah, that should not be able to happen.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.720]   - But I mean, I do think this really brings
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.800]   a very serious question forward.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.720]   Like I'm not someone like, I love Apple,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.040]   I'm a huge Apple fan, everything I buy is Apple.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.280]   But I do think there is some truth.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.320]   I think there's a kernel of truth in these critiques
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.000]   about Apple not making the Mac as big a priority
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.320]   as they used to.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.840]   And I think when you have a devastating bug like this
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.480]   that comes forward, something that really seems like,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.880]   this isn't an edge case,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.960]   this isn't like a really sophisticated bug,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.200]   this is a really big oversight.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.960]   I do think it is reasonable for Mac fans to look at that
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.440]   and go, what's going on here?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.400]   Is the Mac really the priority it needs to be?
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.440]   We're gonna be covering a piece later in the show
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.520]   where it looks at Tim Cook and his legacy so far.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.840]   And I do think that it's a legit criticism.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.720]   The company is big as Apple that they do seem to be struggling
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.800]   with getting out yearly updates for iOS and macOS on time.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.200]   I guess that's my question, is this just, you know, bugs happen?
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.440]   And Apple fixed it quickly, unfixed it,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.960]   I presume they fixed it again.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.360]   Should we draw larger conclusions from this, Christina?
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   Or is it just, that's something that happens?
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.960]   - I think that it's too soon to draw larger conclusion.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.480]   I do agree with, you know, there's been a lot of conversation
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.520]   because it was in addition to the root issue,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.440]   which is a massive, massive security flaw
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   and then kind of it toppled with handling things.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.360]   And then even the root update itself broke file sharing
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.880]   so you have to use terminals to re-enable that.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.600]   You know, if you were using file shares,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.680]   there were some, the iOS 11.2 update
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.600]   that they had to rush out because there was a time.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.880]   - December 2nd, you'd get notifications
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.080]   from third party apps that would crash your iPhone.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.920]   - Right.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.440]   - And by the way, if you had that problem,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.560]   you had to go, it wasn't enough just to install iOS 11.2,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.000]   which came out yesterday.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.840]   You had to turn off all notifications,
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.240]   which by the way is not easy on iOS.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.520]   There's no master switch.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.040]   You've got to go through hundreds of apps.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   - You have to go through each special app.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.880]   - Yeah.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   - Yeah.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.640]   - And I mean, and I think it's fair to say
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.840]   what's happening here, but I think that
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.120]   I don't want to draw massive conclusions from one week,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.240]   from one bad week.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.360]   I think we have to look at things,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.000]   I think if we come back in a year
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.120]   and we're able to kind of say, has this been a pattern?
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.800]   Or even right now, if we were to say,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.560]   what has been the pattern of bug fixes to releases,
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.480]   then you could maybe say something,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   something's rotten as in Mark.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.560]   But other than that,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.160]   but I feel odd making some sort of sweeping generalization
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.000]   after after after a bad week.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.840]   - And you know what?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.880]   You're gonna, some people are gonna say,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.200]   oh, this would never have happened under Steve.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.600]   - Oh, of course it would happen.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.440]   - But it would happen.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.280]   - It happened all the time.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.120]   - And it did.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.080]   - But to be honest, point about,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.560]   you know, the reduced attention to the Mac,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.840]   have we heard, has anybody looked back,
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.480]   or has anybody still got copies of the beta versions
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.720]   of high CR running, you know,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.000]   were they able to look back and see if this bug was in the
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.800]   betas that were running all summer long?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.160]   I mean, how far back does this problem go?
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.920]   And that went that long without anyone noticing.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.760]   - Right.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.600]   - Yeah, well, and then from what,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.840]   I mean, and that that's unclear.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.600]   From what I've read, and I've seen cut some anecdotal stuff,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.280]   there were some form activity in September about it,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.640]   and it does appear as if this probably did exist
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   in the betas.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.400]   And that was the part that to me was the scariest,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.120]   is that this sort of bug existed for so long,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.480]   and wasn't tested.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.680]   - Yeah, but I mean, it would be very serendipitous
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.320]   if somebody, some user, just came along and said,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.840]   I wonder if route would work?
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.880]   - Well, someone did in their own user forums,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.720]   for all this happening.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.000]   - And then nobody did anything about it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.680]   - And then, well, which I, to me,
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.480]   this is the bigger problem than even saying,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   it doesn't all have, you know,
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.480]   is there QA not good enough?
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.200]   'Cause again, I think it's too soon
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.640]   to make that sort of judgment.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.200]   My bigger concern with all of this is that
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.120]   a lot of people really came after the original person
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.680]   who shared the exploit on Twitter and said,
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.280]   you didn't report this the right way,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.600]   and how dare you not go through the right channels,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.440]   XYZ. - Interesting.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.560]   - A, I think that, and I said this on Rocket,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.680]   and I look, I work for a large software company
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.440]   who we have, you know, a big operating system,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.280]   and I don't speak for them,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.120]   but we've definitely had our own fair share
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   of things that go on.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.560]   I'm aware of that, but I think that you have to acknowledge
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.960]   that even though responsible disclosure is good,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.760]   going after the messenger, especially when you are a
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.240]   nearly, you know, you're a $750 billion company,
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.200]   doesn't need its fanboys to attack, you know,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.160]   somebody who brought a bug out there in the public.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.080]   But that's the first thing.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.440]   I think the second thing is,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.880]   and I've talked to a lot of people about this,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   it's not really always really clear with Apple
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.480]   how you can even report a bug,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.160]   and whether or not they will take it seriously.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.760]   And I've talked to people who are well known
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.160]   in the community who often don't feel like their radars,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.080]   which is Apple's term for filing a bug report are seen,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.520]   and have to make a fuss on Twitter,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.680]   and then everyone on Twitter will say,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.520]   well, why didn't you just file a radar?
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.480]   And people are like, well, I do, but nothing happens.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.000]   And case in point, you know, and look,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.160]   I understand that most of the times
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.560]   the Apple user forums are not moderated,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.120]   but if these sorts of things are happening there,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.480]   I'm a little more concerned with,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.720]   are the right channels in place
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.280]   if people do find these sorts of bugs
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   and find these sorts of holes?
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.320]   Is there a right avenue for them to be able
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.440]   to get the communication across?
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.320]   Are the right people looking at those things?
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   That's to me a bigger problem than maybe trying to,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.720]   you know, ascertain whether or not there's a QA issue
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.920]   or they don't care enough about the Mac.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   It's more like, how easy is it for people to report bugs,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.520]   and how confident are we that there are enough people
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.400]   behind the scenes reading those bug reports
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.360]   and testing things out?
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.600]   - Yeah, so the guy who did it is a Turkish developer,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.840]   Lemmy Orhan Aryan.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.240]   He says, "Dear Apple support, this was on Tuesday.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.800]   "We noticed a huge security issue at Mac OS High Sierra.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.080]   "Anyone can log in his route with an empty password
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.960]   "after clicking on an login button several times.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.680]   "Are you aware of it, Apple?"
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.160]   This was his way of reporting it.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.440]   Yeah, I think, you know, if he was a security researcher,
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.160]   you'd expect him to do it in the more traditional method
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.760]   notifying Apple before letting the public know.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.000]   On the other hand, it's such a serious flaw.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.600]   Apple support responded very quickly
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.680]   with send us a private message.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.080]   Let's figure out what's going on.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.420]   So it blindsided Apple a little bit.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.280]   To their credit, they fixed it within two days
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.920]   and then unfixed it, but that's another matter.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.240]   - I can't speak for what's like to work at Apple,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.400]   but I can say like a game studios,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   people that do community management, community support,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.160]   that is often the least respected job
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.600]   in a game development studio.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.120]   It's one of the hardest, it's one of the most critical.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.600]   So it's easy to imagine Apple kind of overlooking
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.160]   this kind of foreign management
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.840]   and not putting the resources into it that they need to.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.040]   For me though, this is a bigger question beyond this book.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.800]   And Christina, I really agree with you.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   I don't wanna draw bigger conclusions here
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.520]   'cause there's not enough data there.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.920]   I think the question is fair.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.000]   I don't think that you can come to a conclusion yet.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.280]   But what really worries me about this
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.800]   is the fact that you could tell Ned in.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.200]   And for me, I do everything right.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.920]   I have Wi-Fi that's a dedicated box.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.760]   I have two factor authentication on everything I can.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.960]   I stick to Max, since I announced my candidacy,
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.840]   I don't use Android phones anymore.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.040]   This bug being out there for somebody like me
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.520]   and many other people,
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   this is the difference in your career
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.360]   like being destroyed or not destroyed.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.720]   Like if every email I ever wrote got out there to the public,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.440]   that would be disaster for anyone.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.280]   So I really-- - Do you use Google's
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.640]   new stronger protection on your Gmail account?
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.280]   First of all, do you use Gmail?
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.680]   - I am forced to use Gmail
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   because it's the only mass market email service
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.480]   that will have two factor authentication built in.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.000]   So we do reluctantly do that.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.520]   - Do you use Google advanced protection?
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.440]   Which is designed specifically for people like you
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.760]   as designed for John Podesta.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.720]   Because of course his Gmail was hacked
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.440]   by the Russians and leaked to WikiLeaks.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.280]   I didn't even think of this,
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.160]   but yes, as I guess as a congressional candidate.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.120]   In fact, are you worried about,
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.480]   you must feel that you might be under it.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.320]   I guess once you, you gotta get through the primary.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.160]   - Sure.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   - Once you get through the primary
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.160]   and I have all confidence you'll get the nomination,
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.120]   you're gonna have to really,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.520]   I think the Russians are gonna be very involved in 2018.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.960]   - So I could probably say this on the show.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.400]   I talked to Chelsea Manning every once in a while.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.160]   And she is somebody that's actively
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.520]   dealing with these same kinds of threats.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.280]   I deal with Facebook fake logins every day.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   I deal with Twitter fake logins every single day.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   So this is something I really, really, really worry about.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.120]   It's, you know, this is political warfare in 2017.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.080]   And by the way, it doesn't have to be Russians who,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.920]   you know, it could be anybody.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.320]   - Absolutely, but you could do the NSA.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.680]   - You've been there before with gamer gates.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.440]   So you kind of know who the,
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.200]   some of the adversaries are anyway.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.880]   Just, this is, you know, I have to commend you
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.200]   for your bravery, Brianna, 'cause if we're me,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.240]   if I were in your shoes, I might just cower in a corner.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.440]   Seriously, you know, give up the public life entirely.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.800]   And you've gone the opposite direction.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.000]   - Yeah, there are some weeks like this week.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It feels a little frustrating sometimes,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   but, you know, that's when the guy gets to work.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   - So there's a larger issue in Elcomsoft,
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.880]   which is a fairly well-known security company,
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.000]   published a story on Wednesday.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.320]   It's titled iOS 11 Horror Story,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.560]   the rise and fall of iOS security.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.720]   Now this is intentional on Apple's part, not a flaw.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.880]   What Elcomsoft does is,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.760]   intentional on Apple's part, not a flaw,
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.560]   what Elcomsoft is saying is that, you know,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.880]   iOS used to be very secure.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.160]   And we've talked about a lot on our shows on security.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   Now Steve Gibson has taught, you know,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.320]   read the Apple white papers on security
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.080]   and has talked a lot about the secure enclave
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.200]   and the things Apple does that are really impressive.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.840]   And Elcomsoft essentially says, that's all changed.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.680]   And they use as an example, Apple,
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.120]   you know, traditionally in security,
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.520]   there's a balance between convenience and security.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.800]   More convenience means less security.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.120]   Apple has decided to move in the direction of convenience,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.960]   in particular, with the encrypted backups of your iPhone.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.280]   It used to be that if you did an encrypted backup
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.440]   of your iPhone, you couldn't,
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.360]   not only could you not use that encrypted backup,
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.800]   but you would have to go through iOS
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.040]   in order to change or remove that password
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.160]   for future backups and provide the old password.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.000]   If you had forgotten that, you'd be stuck,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.680]   you'd have to factory reset the device
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.160]   and you'd lose everything, which was a good protection
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.440]   against your data being stolen.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.360]   Apple has backed down on that.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.400]   And I was not aware of that in iOS 11.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.440]   While you still can have an encryption password
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.720]   in the backup, if you forget it,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.640]   you just go into your phone in iOS settings
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.120]   and you reset the settings, which blanks your passcode.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.160]   You still have to have your iPhone passcode,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.360]   but basically you can create a new encrypted backup
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.920]   from that point on.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.680]   I'm sure this is in response to users
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.360]   constantly calling Apple support.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.520]   I think I've done it a few times myself saying,
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.400]   we can't remember what our encrypted password backup is.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.560]   Can you help?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.560]   But it is now very much easier to do that.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.760]   And what the upshot of that is,
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.920]   if you set a temporary password, made the backup,
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.600]   then decrypted it with an LCOM soft tool.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.560]   They have a tool called Phone Breaker,
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.960]   or just use Keychain Explorer in their phone breaker
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.880]   to, you could access the user's passwords,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.320]   authentication tokens, credit card numbers,
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.860]   everything in that key chain.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.080]   And while you're at it,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.880]   you might as well go through their photos account as well.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.280]   So what is interesting is happening
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.960]   and what a couple of questions come to mind.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.840]   A, is Apple backing down a little bit
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.040]   on their traditionally very steep security?
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.600]   And I for one have been a constant complainer about,
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.360]   God, I gotta enter my password again.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.760]   It used to be in iOS.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.480]   You'd enter your password at the drop.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.520]   That has, by the way, if you've noticed,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.800]   you don't do that as much anymore.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.880]   Or, if I'm really paranoid,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.960]   is this in response to pressure
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.720]   from federal law enforcement agencies
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.920]   who really have been angry at Apple
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.480]   because the iPhone is so hard for them to get into.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.320]   - Is what you just described there,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.280]   have they effectively put a backdoor?
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.480]   - It's not a backdoor.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   - No.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.960]   - But it means it would be good for law enforcement
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.760]   or a master key, I guess.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.560]   - It means it's easier to get into the data,
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.080]   even if it's encrypted.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.520]   - I mean, I think it's important to note,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.760]   and I'm not disputing what Alcomsoft is saying,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.840]   but I do think it's important to note
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.240]   that a lot of this was an advertisement
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.560]   for their phone breaker software.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.120]   - Yes, as well as security companies do this.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.400]   - Well, yes, but I think it's important in this context,
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.200]   especially to say, I've actually used their software.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.000]   When the iCloud hack happened
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.280]   and the celebrities' photos were taken
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.800]   and spread across the way,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.200]   and we started asking a lot of questions about iCloud backups.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.480]   I actually bought their software,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.160]   used some other tools and wrote an article for Mashable
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.280]   about how I hacked my own iCloud for $200.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.120]   - I remember that.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.760]   - And I used their software to do it.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.120]   And so part of this, I think, is obviously
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.360]   an advertisement to their software,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.040]   and I'm not really sure how the encrypted backup stuff
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.960]   has changed, but it's something that even Alcomsoft
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.640]   has bragged about being able to do for years.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.200]   Far predating any of the FBI stuff.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.560]   And so I feel like we can ask questions
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.280]   about how much physical access is required
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.600]   and how good or how bad various forensic software is
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   and what it can do.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.720]   But I don't feel like we can go far enough to say
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.880]   that Apple is putting the back doors
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.480]   or is trying to couch how to government pressure
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.520]   because the company went out of its way
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   on a big level to fight the government's order
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.000]   for them to get into that San Bernardino phone.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.600]   And from everyone that I've talked to at Apple,
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.480]   they went out of the way to make iOS 10
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.000]   and iOS 11 even more secure.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.200]   So the local backup things,
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.120]   I agree that could be a potential flaw.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.160]   I think you also have to say
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.640]   how many people actively backup their phones
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.800]   on their computers, and that number is decreasing
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.080]   all the time, and in fact, iTunes is becoming less and less
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.320]   used to even install apps on your phone.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.440]   They took that feature out of iTunes 12 point, whatever.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.840]   So it's a concern, but I have to kind of,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.200]   my ears prick up a little bit and think,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.680]   okay, but how much of this is just about promoting,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.240]   the newest version of phone breaker.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.760]   - Yeah, I think that's fair though, Christina.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.080]   But I think the thing I would say,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.920]   do you remember President Obama
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   when he spoke at South by Southwest two years ago,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.880]   he made comments there,
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.120]   they're directly related to this.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.560]   This really struck me when he said it
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.720]   'cause it scared the mess out of me, to be honest.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.080]   He said that in response to the Apple San Bernardino case,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.680]   if Apple did not work with the government,
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   find out a way to give courts access to iPhones
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.600]   when situations like that came up,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.480]   that he believed Congress would go behind their back
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.840]   and in secret pass laws that would force them
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.280]   to give them access, and that's something they can do.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.920]   Like you can pass laws like that in secret committee.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   So I think you can have like an utterly,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.000]   like I'm right there with you.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.960]   I think Apple has the best of intentions.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.400]   They've made their statement known,
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.680]   they have a great track record,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.080]   that's why I buy their stuff.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.640]   I do think that that, like Leah, what you're saying,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.920]   I don't believe that's true automatically,
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.480]   but I think it's a reasonable fear to have.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.560]   - It will happen sometime if it has an amount.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   - Yeah, it happens.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.320]   - By the way, the perfectly logical explanation,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.840]   merely that customers were complaining it was too hard,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.000]   so we're gonna make it a little bit easier.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.040]   And by the way, the takeaway and Alcomsoft says this
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.440]   at the end of the article is,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.040]   because you're really, your only protection on your phone
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.560]   is your passcode, don't do a six digit passcode,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   use a long, strong passcode because that is the last line
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.040]   of defense, contrary to previous versions of iOS 11.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.440]   - Is it also potentially another of those signs
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.280]   of maybe neglect of the Mac?
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.760]   - Since it's a small Mac. - I don't think so.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.600]   I don't think so.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.040]   I think that's why I brought this up in contrast
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.720]   to what we were talking about earlier with the login bug.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.200]   That was a flaw that was an error
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.720]   that was maybe lack of attention.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.640]   This is a very conscious decision.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.400]   This is Apple's Security X we're saying, all right,
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.280]   we've got this balance, convenience, security.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.680]   We feel like maybe convenience has gone down too much,
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.640]   maybe we're getting too many calls to support.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.600]   We're gonna make it more convenient.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.120]   It's gonna be less secure.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.360]   It's something people should be aware of.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.520]   And you're right, obviously every security firm
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.240]   when they report security flaws,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.840]   it's an ad for the security firm as much as anything else.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.720]   So I always take those with a grain of salt.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   I'm glad, Christine, you brought up Obama's appearance
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.880]   at South by Southwest.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   'Cause that was the one where he said,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.600]   "You can't take an absolutist view on phone encryption."
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.240]   He says, "We gotta stop fetishizing our smartphones."
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.600]   He says, "If your bargain is strong encryption,
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.480]   "no matter what, that we can and should in fact
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.680]   "create black boxes, I think that does not strike
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.120]   "the kind of balance that we've lived with
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.000]   "for two or three hundred years.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.800]   "It's fetishizing our phones above every other value.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.440]   "That cannot be the right answer."
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   - But it's not about fetishizing our phones.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.360]   - And by the, he was--
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.360]   - You talked about this before.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.440]   - Well, everything's in there.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.960]   It's your brain. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.800]   - The phone is an extension of your brain.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.320]   It's about keeping what we know secure.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.880]   Whether that be in here or in our phones,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.160]   you want that, we have a right, the Fifth Amendment.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.120]   Gives us that right to protect that information.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.960]   - It is a balance.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:35.960]   And I think Obama brought up a very good point,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.520]   which is we expect and want law enforcement
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.320]   to maintain law and order in a civilized society.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.080]   If there are, it's a very difficult challenge.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.440]   If anybody, criminals and us alike,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.440]   can make completely impenetrable storage,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.840]   where does that put law enforcement?
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.800]   But it's a very difficult answer.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.200]   I don't think, I understand why he brought it up.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.600]   I think he's wrong.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.800]   But I can understand why law enforcement feels that way,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.120]   'cause they also feel they have a--
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.960]   - But they have a lot of other tools to work with.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.800]   - Responsibly, too.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Things like metadata and--
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.640]   - Right.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.240]   - There's plenty of other things,
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.080]   information that they can glean from other sources
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.440]   that help them do their job.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.320]   They don't necessarily need to have access
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.400]   to every single device.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.880]   - Well, there's a bottom line in this whole conversation,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.080]   which is it's more and more up to the user
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   to be cautious, to pay attention to security,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.240]   to do the right thing,
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.720]   maybe have a better, stronger passcode on your phone
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.440]   and pay attention to security bullets,
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.200]   because who knows, somebody could log in.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.360]   You don't have Telnet running on your Mac, though,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.600]   I hope, Brianna.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.960]   - No, no, no, of course not.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.800]   - Please, I won't.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.640]   (laughing)
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.560]   - But it's, yeah, what worries me is,
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.600]   like, our security researchers,
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.800]   these are, like, Christine is saying
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.160]   they're trying to sell a product,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.320]   but I think as far as, like, a market capitalization,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.040]   there's not enough security research out there
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.160]   in comparison to what I have to imagine,
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.960]   like, governments all around the world
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.640]   are spending on trying to hack this stuff.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.480]   - Right.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.000]   - I think for us as a nation,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.680]   we've got to have a really adult conversation
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.520]   of how can we better fund security research?
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.160]   How can we, like, protect this infrastructure?
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.800]   'Cause right now, like, I mean,
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.200]   all respect to the ones out there doing it right now.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.520]   Like, they're saving the world,
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.480]   but we need a lot more of that, so.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.840]   - Well, and absolutely, but I would even go a step farther,
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.760]   and we've got to actively fight companies,
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.720]   and this happens time and time again,
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.040]   who threaten to jail the security researcher,
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.880]   who comes up with a flaw.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.040]   Federal authorities who use the very, you know,
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.200]   draconian anti-hacking laws to go after people
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.880]   who are really just trying to make us more secure.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.520]   The IP, intellectual property protection laws,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.800]   like the DMCA, that forbid security researchers
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.200]   from looking at flaws entirely,
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.800]   all of these things have to be fixed.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.960]   It is, you know, I'm amazed people still
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.560]   are security researchers.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.600]   There is such a risk to them.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.120]   - Well, fortunately, you know,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   from my perspective, from the auto industry,
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.560]   it's, things have actually changed quite a bit
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.280]   in the last, just in the last two or three years.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.840]   When I first started talking to people in the industry
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.160]   about this back in 2010, 2011,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.520]   you know, they would stick their heads in the sand.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.280]   You know, hacking's not an issue with, you know,
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.680]   our telematic systems, like, you know,
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.320]   like Hotstar and other systems.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.840]   But in the last, and you know,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.800]   as recently as, you know, about three years ago,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.360]   you had GM joining John Deere
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.160]   and fighting DMCA exemptions for security research.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.680]   And now they've, at least the auto industry,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.560]   and I don't know about John Deere,
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.480]   but the auto industry has moved beyond that,
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.680]   and they've really embraced security researchers,
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.880]   because as they move forward into this world
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.760]   of automated and connected vehicles,
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.920]   they realize the risks inherent in that.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.000]   And so they're, you know, they've,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.600]   several companies have now formed Bug Bounty Programs
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.960]   for the first time.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.840]   Tesla was first, GM and Chrysler have done it now.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.120]   Others have informal Bug Bounty Programs.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.560]   And last year, the industry also formed
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.120]   an auto ISAC, an information sharing and analysis center.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.040]   ISACs are common in a lot of different industry verticals.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.320]   And for the first time,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.840]   we now have one in the auto industry
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.840]   that enables the both automakers and suppliers
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.160]   to work together to share information
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.800]   about best practices and, you know,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.000]   some of the threats that are out there
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.920]   and how to fight these threats.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.040]   So fortunately, at least in the auto industry,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.640]   you know, we've seen a change of attitude
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.040]   towards security researchers.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.480]   And now, you know, Charlie Miller and Chris Valisak,
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.280]   who I'm sure you know those names.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.120]   - I love them, yep.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   - Both of those guys are now working for Cruise Automation,
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.480]   which is a subsidiary of General Motors
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.840]   that's developing their automated driving software
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.240]   here in San Francisco.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   - Yeah.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.600]   So, you know, I mean, there's some stories,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.640]   some success stories.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.760]   This month, the Department of Defense, the Pentagon,
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.400]   invited hackers to attack it.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.200]   And as a result, fixed thousands of bugs,
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.600]   hacking protected systems, even to reveal weaknesses
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.800]   is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.920]   The Department of Justice has repeatedly made it clear
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.120]   that it will enforce the law.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.840]   This is according to Lily Hay Newman writing in Wired.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.160]   But in the last 18 months,
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   a new Department of Defense project called Hack the Pentagon
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.680]   has offered real glimmers of hope
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.120]   that these prejudices could change.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.320]   They found thousands of bugs in the DOD's
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.220]   public facing websites.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.560]   This was a great success.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.200]   I also want to, by the way, circle around on the Apple root
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.680]   story because Lemmy Orhan Arian, who tweeted about the root
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.200]   flaw, did write a Medium post, which I had missed,
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.840]   who said, "I did not discover this.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.640]   "It was actually discovered at my company."
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.120]   And it had been mentioned, they discovered it in a week
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.360]   earlier and had informed Apple about it.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.000]   And it had been on the Apple developer forum
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.960]   since November 13th.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.280]   But Apple either hadn't paid attention,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.120]   didn't want to publicize it, didn't have a fix.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.680]   So he said, "After I was told by my IT guys
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.120]   "that I had to get a root password on my Mac
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.400]   "to fix this problem," he said, "What?"
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.840]   And he tweeted it.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.920]   He tweeted it.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.400]   But it had been, Apple had been apprised of it weeks earlier
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.400]   and apparently decided not to take it seriously,
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.840]   didn't see it.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.840]   So this is something that really has to be changed.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.960]   The laws have to be changed and there has to be a culture
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.040]   of encouraging security researchers to find these flaws
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.400]   or the bad guys will find them first.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   - I think it's really important to say
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.000]   if we're talking about changing the laws on this,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.960]   you don't have to get every single jerk store in Congress
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.120]   to agree with this and pass a law.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.800]   There is one committee.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.840]   And if you have 15 votes on that,
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.760]   you can append legislation to make sure
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.920]   that security researchers have A, B and C.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.200]   This is a solvable problem with the,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.320]   if you get a group of technologically literate people
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.880]   to run and replace the technologically illiterate people
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.960]   in there, they're currently responsible
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.560]   for gutting net neutrality.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.520]   So this can happen.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.400]   We just need more technologically literate people
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.560]   to get involved in public service.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.720]   - So with you, we'll have one.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.400]   Yeah, get on that committee if you can, Brianna.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.560]   - Absolutely.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.800]   I actually worried that the Democrats will block me
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.320]   getting on that committee if I win
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.720]   because you all respect to them.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.480]   A lot of them take money from these same groups,
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.840]   Verizon and Comcast.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.560]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.280]   - You see, do you have that still in the tricaster
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.840]   from yesterday, Carsten?
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.320]   The front page of Reddit at one point yesterday,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.200]   I love how Redditors will get together
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.840]   and do these campaigns.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.680]   They, they, they, each, many, many Redditors posted,
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.000]   my member of Congress is X.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.040]   She received this many dollars
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.400]   in the telecommunications industry
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.200]   and voted against net neutrality.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.320]   And then the front, the entire front page of Twitter
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.360]   for a brief period of time,
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.640]   because they had then campaigns to vote
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.480]   those karma up on all those,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.360]   was one after another member of Congress,
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.680]   member of Congress, member of Congress,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.520]   member of Congress, member of Congress,
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.360]   the amount of money.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.720]   And it is amazing how inexpensive it is
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.480]   to buy a member of Congress.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.160]   - 24,000 bucks, you can have their vote too.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.240]   - Yeah, their vote and congressional votes are cheap.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.080]   - Yeah.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.920]   - It's really depressing.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.080]   Marcia Blackburn from Tennessee,
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.160]   if I remember correctly,
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.920]   her number two downer is Verizon
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.040]   and it was something like 60, $70,000,
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.160]   which is not that much in a congressional campaign.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.480]   It's really sad.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.040]   - Well, and not to veer off into politics,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.160]   but one of the stories behind the tax law
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.720]   that was passed in such a strange way,
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.680]   a couple of nights, or last night, was it last night?
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.520]   - It was Friday night.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.440]   - Friday night was the threat
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.360]   from both sides to members of,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.680]   Republican members of Congress
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.840]   that they would lose their seat.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.320]   From the right, people like Steve Bannon saying,
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.360]   if you don't vote for this,
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.280]   the Koch brothers saying, if you don't vote for this,
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.640]   we're gonna oust you.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   We're gonna get a better candidate
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.080]   and you're gonna lose in the primaries.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.160]   And from the left, people saying,
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.120]   we don't want this tax bill.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.080]   Republicans are gonna lose in 2018.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.200]   I don't know if you're a Republican member of Congress.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.080]   I don't know what you would do.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.120]   I think I would hope,
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.640]   one would hope you would do the right thing.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.240]   Do what your conscience dictated
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.640]   because you're gonna get screwed.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.800]   - Well, one would hope you would--
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.640]   - You're at least maybe follow the unheated advice
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.880]   of Senator McCain and follow regular order
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.240]   and have some hearings under this.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.400]   - Yeah, even just--
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.240]   - Can we read it?
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.080]   - Can we read it?
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.400]   - Yeah, I'm not scribbling in amendments
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.000]   on the side of the bill.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.560]   But even he voted for it.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.320]   - So it's meaningless.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.240]   - Really, the last person on the food chain is the voter.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.560]   I mean, you've got the lobbyists,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.520]   I'm not just talking about the tax,
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.560]   but let's talk about that in a trial.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.200]   The lobbyists pouring money into these election coffers.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   Other different groups with money, with different agendas.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.160]   And the last, the person that's the least important
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.600]   seems to be the voter.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.720]   I think we can fix that by voting.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.080]   I would hope.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.120]   - Yep. - I would hope.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.680]   Anyway, I didn't mean to get political,
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   but it's just mind-boggling how dysfunctional this has become.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.480]   Let's take a break and we will come back.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   Lots more tech news with the panel of,
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.600]   well, we'll be brand of woo

[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.840]   and Simone Abul-Samid from
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:15.800]   Senior Analysts with Navigant Research.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.400]   It's Rocket West and we are gonna continue
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.960]   in just a little bit.

[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.440]   And it is that time of year
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.920]   that you do not wanna go to the post office
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.440]   because it's amateur hour.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.560]   You get all the people, you get in line with all the people
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.120]   and they've got boxes and boxes.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.560]   They're gonna mail stuff all over the country for gifts.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.400]   That's fine.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.220]   But if your business involves sending stuff through the mail,
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.760]   you don't have time to do that.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.040]   You don't have time to go to the post office.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:45.960]   You do what we do.

[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.360]   Brown paper wrapped in twine with hand-licked stamps.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.320]   I guess you lick it with your tongue,
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.800]   but the hand's holding the stamp.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.280]   Hand-licked stamps.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.200]   Usually in excess of the amount needed,
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.600]   'cause well, who wants to send anything postage to?
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.160]   But sometimes with fewer stamps than necessary,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.240]   and I gotta pay, that is not a good,
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.480]   I got a PR package last year.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.080]   That was postage to.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.040]   And it's like, that is not a good introduction
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.080]   to your clients, to your customers.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.600]   which fixed that crash on December 2nd.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.640]   Anybody have that happen?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.200]   No, I've fortunately upgraded right before.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.560]   I guess it started.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.280]   One advantage being on the West Coast now.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.440]   Yeah, I get it early.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.120]   I am like three hours fine.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.640]   Oh, yeah, you know what?
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.600]   It's the East Coasters that got screwed on that one.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.440]   All right.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.280]   Yeah, but yeah.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.840]   People like in the earlier time zones
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.680]   started to get the problem.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.280]   Then everybody else was like, oh man, update.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.120]   So I saw that.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.400]   I was like, oh, yeah, no, I need to update.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   Okay.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.920]   I saw people in Australia freaking out about it.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.880]   So I headed off to, I was very happy about that.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.440]   Twitter, say, plus.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.280]   No December.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.120]   And you guys entered off.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.080]   So I never get in updates.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.520]   You don't get in updates at all.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.760]   Nothing to worry about.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.080]   I have a pixel like all of them.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.400]   I get in Google.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.280]   Nothing to worry about.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.160]   Actually, if you're using the new Pixel 2,
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.160]   Google did push out a beta, a public beta there.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.720]   And I think the last beta for 8.1,
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.800]   that this is wild.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   They had an extra chip in here that wasn't turned on yet.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.320]   A camera chip.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.360]   And with 8.1, it gets turned on.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.080]   And I guess it has something to do with their HDR plus.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.600]   I'll bet you that's not the last time
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.200]   that we're going to see a unit of Alphabet
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.560]   using that technology.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.000]   And not just in mobile devices.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.160]   Or in very larger, much larger mobile devices.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   Like cars, like Waymo.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.240]   Wouldn't be at all surprised.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.640]   Waymo beta.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.400]   Yep.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.240]   Interesting.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.680]   Imaging is a big part of self-driving.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.000]   It absolutely is.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Being able to recognize what all your sensors are seeing
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.920]   and detect what they are between their machine learning
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.440]   algorithms and chips like this imaging sensor
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.960]   or the simaging chip.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.360]   I think there's a lot of interesting potential.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.960]   Do you think we're benefiting from--
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.360]   that's interesting.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.720]   That in some ways, I think with Google,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.840]   you're a guinea pig.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.360]   Right?
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.040]   You want to upload all your photos to Google Photos.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.680]   It's because they want to train their AI.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.040]   When we're buying a Pixel 2, you're a guinea pig.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.400]   But you also simultaneously get the benefit.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.040]   Because some of the stuff they're developing for Waymo,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.240]   you is in there too.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:37.920]   Absolutely.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.560]   It's interesting.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.680]   I never thought about that.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.760]   I think from all the captures I've done,
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.960]   like helping identify strong signs.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.160]   Right.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.360]   I think at the first generation of terminators
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.000]   is just hunting street signs.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.200]   We're all kind of fine.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:51.720]   Street signs.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.240]   Is this the thing?
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.280]   Street signs, cars.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.080]   That's the new thing.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.240]   Store fronts and street signs in the capture.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.440]   I get a lot of those, right?
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:57.960]   Same.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.360]   Same.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.240]   Yeah, because they're trying to recognize everything
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.160]   in the street view for a while.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   It was street numbers.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:04.680]   It was numbers.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.800]   You remember that?
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:11.360]   It was a lot of funky old numbers, painted over 100 time
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:11.720]   numbers.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.400]   A lot of the captures that we're seeing from Google now
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.200]   are probably things that they're seeing each time they move
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.560]   into a new city with their Waymo test program.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.280]   The first thing they do is they spend a month or two
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.840]   just driving around generating high definition maps
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.520]   of everything in that city.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.000]   And so I'll bet a lot of what we're seeing in there
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.320]   is training the systems that are recognizing everything
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.960]   in those images.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.400]   When was Skynet born?
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400]   In the terminator?
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.560]   How are we already past that day?
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.880]   How weird we did.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.840]   Was it 2015 or something or 2014 or something?
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.680]   1999.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.240]   Oh, yes.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.920]   We're way past.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.680]   We just don't know it.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.240]   What?
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:54.800]   Skynet--
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.680]   And you guys, Google wasn't Google founded in 1998.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.320]   Oh, no.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.880]   Well, when would you say it's born?
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.440]   A conception--
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.480]   When it becomes self-aware.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.640]   A gestation when it becomes self-aware.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.880]   That's when Skynet's born.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.280]   Not when they start working on it.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.520]   Well, according to the new tax bill, it's all a conception.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.680]   I'm not joking.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   I know you're not joking.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.160]   You're right.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.680]   I know you're not joking.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   [GASPS]
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.200]   I have to tell y'all, like Boston Dynamics,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.400]   the robots that come out with are scarier and scarier.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.120]   And that's like a big deal for where it works.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.320]   I think it's even scarier when they try to make them look
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.600]   less scary like the latest.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   Oh, no.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:32.960]   Oh.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.480]   You're right it is.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.560]   It's like they have the dogs.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.680]   Like, oh, look.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.360]   The life like movement, I'm like, what are you talking about?
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.880]   This is the scariest thing I've ever seen.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.320]   But we painted it yellow.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.440]   Why are you still scared?
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.920]   It's a yellow dog.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.560]   How could you possibly be scared?
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.640]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.720]   Of a yellow.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.240]   Oh my god, Eric, come here.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.760]   It comes.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.320]   No, look at me.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.560]   Oh, it's looking at me.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.560]   Oh, god.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   It's terrifying.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.080]   It is.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.600]   Yep.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.360]   Don't look exactly the eyes.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.720]   I like the little-- it's called Spot Mini,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.200]   as if that would reassure you.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.160]   Is it bad health?
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:01.760]   It's like, no.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.440]   I mean, what would help is if you put a head on it, honestly.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.920]   If you put like a little robot head on it with blinking lights
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.840]   and made it more fit.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.320]   And to bring it back, I don't--
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.520]   I'm so excited.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.360]   I want to import one.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.480]   I just don't want to pay the monthly fee that I want to new IBO.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.560]   How expensive is it?
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.040]   Is it--
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.560]   Oh, so in particular, I think--
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.080]   1,200, I think.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:22.560]   --expensive.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.240]   And then what?
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.080]   And you have to pay a subscription fee.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   $20 a month or something.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.680]   A new IBO robot.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.440]   Let me turn off the audio on this.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:29.760]   Oh, wow.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.320]   So here's-- it's cuter than ever before.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   I think it's adorable.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.800]   I love the original IBO.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.960]   I had the second generation one, because when
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.840]   Sharper Image went out of business, I got it for like a song.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.880]   But as everyone else's, the battery has died.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.400]   Right.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.760]   So you couldn't do anything with it?
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.360]   Nope.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:46.840]   Where is it?
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.480]   Is it on your desk with the Uya?
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.980]   No.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.320]   It was my parents' house.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.440]   My parents' basement at some place.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.720]   What parents?
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.680]   Oh, god.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.800]   It's down there with--
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.840]   I have three Sawtooth Mac G4 Mac towers down there.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.280]   I don't know what to do with those great cheese grater
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:03.780]   towers.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.120]   They're the best thing ever.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.480]   Well, these were before the cheese grater.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.680]   This was the Sawtooth.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.160]   So it was like the Bondi Blue one.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.920]   But it had the opening.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.080]   It was like the first G4 tower.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.400]   They were nice.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.840]   Some of them are better than others.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.240]   I can't-- those aren't even my fault.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.080]   Those are Grant's fault.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.560]   When Grant and I first started dating,
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.200]   he had this habit of--
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.920]   Grant is my husband.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.720]   He's had this habit of--
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.840]   he was taking Ambien.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.720]   And he had a prescription.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.840]   Oh, this is not going to end well.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.680]   I can tell this anecdote is going to go to hell.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.480]   He would do bizarre online shopping.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:38.920]   Wow.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.440]   And not remember a thing.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.240]   Not remember it.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   So stuff would show up.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.520]   So he got three or four of these G4 towers off of eBay.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.640]   And at one point, he also--
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.760]   or from somebody like Craigslist, somebody local,
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:55.440]   he also got a 20-inch flat panel CRT monitor
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.520]   that weighed a million pounds.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.760]   So it was like, why did we buy this?
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.920]   We don't have room for this.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.800]   We don't need this.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.600]   He also-- he had a sun spark box
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.920]   because he'd always wanted one.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.600]   And that was really weird.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.200]   And then he found some other thing.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.320]   I don't even remember what it was.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.960]   But he thought it was some sort of terminal,
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.920]   some sort of computer terminal that he thought was really cool.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   He had no recollection when it came in.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.120]   And then it turned out it didn't even
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.000]   do what he thought or wanted to do.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.560]   So when we were moving to New York,
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.120]   we were going through all this stuff.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.880]   What I was calling all the Ambien tech.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.480]   And I was like, yeah, no.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.520]   It's Ambien tech.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.720]   Oh my gosh.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.920]   Christina, I have to say, you're fooling
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.320]   no one on this show.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.040]   I know you.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.240]   You're going to say, I'm not going to buy the i-bo.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.240]   And then you're going to buy the i-bo.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.600]   And you're going to pay the monthly fee.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.760]   And you're going to come out with the Rocha's i-bo.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.280]   Hey, Christina.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.040]   You're going to buy that too.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.160]   Just get Stephen Hackett's address
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.880]   and have your mom send it all to him.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.400]   He'll take care of you.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.360]   I was actually thinking about that.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.960]   I was actually thinking to send them to Stephen
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.640]   because he might appreciate them to go with some
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   of his collection.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.880]   And you're right, Bri.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.520]   I would totally pay the monthly fee.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   My issue is that it's only in Japan for right now.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.440]   So I'm not going to pay a monthly fee in Japan.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.600]   Like where I draw the line is getting the Japanese credit
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.960]   card and subscribing to some Japanese mobile service.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.080]   So I can try to have that.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.520]   I will try to--
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.440]   Just take an ambient.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.920]   It'll all make sense.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.400]   Just do that.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.840]   I think there'll be a great show this week in ambient tech.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.920]   Stuff I bought when I was unconscious.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.600]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.080]   You know what?
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   You married a good guy.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.880]   I now approve of your choice.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.640]   That's an excellent bias.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.400]   I always wanted to spark box.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400]   Why not?
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.400]   They're cheap.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.480]   Hey, at least it's not going to get you a speeding ticket.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.880]   True.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.640]   Yes.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.480]   Right.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.040]   By the way, a quick update on the Google emoji controversy.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.880]   Oh, god.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.200]   I love this.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.520]   Google has now fixed the beer emoji.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.400]   The beer goes all the way to the foam.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.040]   Good call.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.280]   It oddly did not.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.480]   And where's the cheese on the hamburger?
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.360]   Where it belongs on top of the meat.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.840]   Wait a minute, that's the old one.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.680]   There is the new one.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.120]   There you go.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.080]   That's Android 8.1 is going to fix that.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.840]   It's going to turn on the camera chip
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.280]   and put the cheese on top of the meat.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.040]   That's what matters.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.560]   People are still getting excited over the lettuce,
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.120]   the tomato placement, but at least the cheese
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.040]   is in the right spot.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.720]   Yeah, it still looks a little odd, doesn't it?
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.280]   Why is the lettuce on top of the tomato?
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.960]   I've been hearing all this controversy
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.200]   for the last couple of weeks.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.680]   It's like, it's an icon.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.360]   Who cares?
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.160]   Oh, I care.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:33.840]   I care.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.400]   I care.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.600]   It doesn't look right.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.000]   Doesn't that bother you?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.280]   No.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:37.720]   Yes.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.760]   Maybe I'm OCD.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.680]   OK, Christina, you and I are OCD.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.120]   No, well, and it's not just that.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.320]   But as we've discussed on the show many times, Leo,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.800]   like, emoji is its own form of pigeon.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.280]   It's its own form of communication.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.760]   So when it doesn't look right, it can alter your message.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   I mean, it's silly, but I'm glad they fixed it.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.080]   I feel like I learned so much about hamburger.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.400]   So the burger, like stuff I would never thought about.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.680]   Like, OK, if you put the lettuce underneath it,
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.880]   then the tomato juice will not drip down.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.960]   Like, I feel like this has been very educational.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.280]   But I don't see the little chunks of pepperoni in the burger,
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.840]   because that's something you got to do.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.440]   You got to slice the chopped chocolate chip.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:15.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.800]   Mix it in the butter.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.680]   It's good.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.160]   Wow.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:18.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.040]   I have the beer controversy.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.080]   And somehow, that one's even more egregious to me,
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.520]   that the beer didn't go all the way to the top.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.760]   But yet, there were suds at the top.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.400]   That was just weird.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.400]   That was just weird.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.200]   To me, that one is somehow more egregious than the cheese
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:30.560]   in the bottom.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.840]   The cheese in the bottom is still horrible.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.160]   But for whatever reason, like, the beer having such--
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.800]   That was kind of odd.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.880]   Having that air gap, of course, maybe it
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.640]   was some sort of security thing.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.120]   Who knows?
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:45.480]   Maybe.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.240]   Maybe some sort of magic beer, I don't know.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.080]   But that's odd.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:56.440]   Do we want to talk-- this is actually
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.640]   an interesting story.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.440]   And I don't know how we're going to quite get into this.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.640]   Uber-- of course, there's endless Uber stories.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.840]   Which one?
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.880]   Just say Uber and let you talk about your favorite one.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.520]   But what I thought was interesting
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.920]   is Uber a few months ago was started encouraging its employees
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.120]   to use auto-destruct messaging apps.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.040]   Oh, so bad.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.520]   And the judge is upset.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.800]   The judge is actually pissed off because that's--
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.840]   Yes, it should be.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.080]   The question is, so Reuters says,
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.720]   Uber's use of encrypted messaging may set legal precedence.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.880]   But I think Reuters is confusing encrypted messaging
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.560]   with self-destruct messaging.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.000]   No destructing.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.440]   Yes.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:47.940]   Yes.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.520]   Both of them are problematic.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.120]   But at least with encrypted messaging,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.560]   the message still exists so you could
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.680]   in serid demand be unencrypted.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.240]   The key.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:56.760]   Yes.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.920]   You could in theory say that as part of the discovery,
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.240]   you have to turn over the key to decrypt these messages.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.360]   The self-destruct part is what's more damaging,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.400]   especially in the--
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.720]   you know, in conjunction with this case.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.640]   And obviously, I mean, I think of all of us here.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.000]   Sam knows the most about this Waymo, Uber stuff, I'm sure,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.480]   and all the stuff it's over.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.720]   But this is insane.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.960]   Well, among other people, Corey Lewandowski
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.800]   was using it.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.240]   Anthony Lewandowski.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.400]   Anthony, not Corey Lewandowski.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.480]   Corey Lewandowski is a Trump guy.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.160]   Anthony Lewandowski was using it.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.760]   And so they were using something called Wicker,
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.360]   which I had never heard of.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.520]   So the issue was that, for instance, and the judges
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:48.040]   talking about this, he says, in fact, attorneys
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.960]   that counsel and future cases could be found in malpractice
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.320]   if they are unable to turn over evidence
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.480]   from specialized communication tools like Wicker.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.760]   For instance, Wicki would have been away for Lewandowski
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.760]   to communicate with other members of the engineers.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.360]   They could say, hey, Anthony, when you had--
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.720]   how did Waymo solve this problem with a trolley car?
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.080]   Anthony could respond, and that would, 30 seconds later,
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.440]   that whole conversation's gone forever.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.160]   There is a responsibility for companies
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.880]   to preserve this paper trail, especially--
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   when there's litigation going on.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.440]   If they're concerned that there's
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.960]   going to be litigation and they're deleting it intentionally.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.280]   I mean, most companies have retention policies for email.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.240]   And unless it's relevant to something you're working on now,
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.920]   if it's over a certain age, you're
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.600]   supposed to delete it and get rid of it.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.720]   But if there's ongoing litigation,
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.120]   and it's relevant to that litigation,
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.040]   then you're supposed to retain it.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   Right.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.120]   That sounds like this.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.600]   How long was-- this was 30 seconds that it was?
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600]   Well, I don't know.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.160]   They actually end up getting a wicker version that
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.560]   kept it for a year, the business version of wicker.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.120]   Depending on when they started using this,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.320]   if they're used predates, Lewandowski's arrival at Uber,
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.360]   you could, I suppose, make a case for that.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.720]   I'm not a lawyer.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.560]   That could be more of their attachment policy.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.960]   Dara, Kosovo Shoshahi.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.120]   Dara, Kosovo Shoshahi.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.160]   Kosovo Shahi.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.120]   Thank you.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.200]   I can't say your name either.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.560]   So it's good that you would help me with this one.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.400]   The new CEO said that-- he says, true,
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.240]   that Wicker Telegram were often used at Uber when I came in
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.200]   as of September 27th, and I directed my teams not
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.840]   to use such apps when discussing Uber-related business.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.080]   So I have a question kind of related to this.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.800]   Obviously, wicker and signal are one thing.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.000]   And we kind of know what those are.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.880]   But Slack, which is obviously a much more common tool.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.080]   And I think that people kind of raise their eyes
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.360]   and understandably so to say, why are you,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.720]   why are you using Wicker signal?
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.680]   And like you were saying, Sam, of course,
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.640]   you could make the argument that if the use predated
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.920]   of Love and Dowsky's hiring and an auto--
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.880]   or was it auto?
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.200]   What was the name of his company that was--
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   Auto--
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.200]   Auto--
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.440]   Yeah, an auto being acquired and becoming part of it,
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.760]   then maybe you could say, well, this was already
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.880]   kind of common practice.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.800]   But I think it would still raise eyebrows in any event
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.800]   that to do company business you're using,
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.320]   wicker you're using, signal.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.640]   But let's take Slack as an example,
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.360]   which is a very common business tool.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.080]   And Slack, even though they have retention policies
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.280]   and that most companies do them,
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.360]   you can also set things within channels,
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.080]   whether they're private or public, to auto-delete
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.560]   after a certain period of time.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.280]   So after three days, after a week, after 24 hours,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.360]   it'll delete.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.920]   I don't know.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.560]   Maybe one of you three does.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.760]   I don't know if what Slack's ultimate retention policies
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.920]   are like, are those--
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.200]   It's up to the user.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200]   It's up to the user.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.280]   And in fact, somebody in the chat
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.720]   I'm saying you can set Slack to delete direct messages
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.600]   after 24 hours.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.200]   Yes, you can.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.320]   And I say that what I'm saying is from a corporate level
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.280]   is that something that is a log still
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.320]   maintained going to the admin.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.840]   That I'm not sure about, because Slack is obviously
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.200]   used much more frequently than any of these other tools are.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.320]   And as someone who worked for a company that was sued
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.880]   and who's Slack and other logs were brought into litigation,
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.680]   I didn't work there at the time,
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.400]   but I have friends with people who were part of that.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.160]   I know that that can be really painful.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:29.360]   But you do wonder if you can delete those things,
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.400]   does that become a problem within discovery
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.160]   in a legal sense?
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.200]   Because wicker and signal are one thing,
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   but more traditional, more quote unquote legit
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.640]   collaboration tools, I think that the question becomes
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   sticky, right?
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.160]   Right.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.960]   Well, I think it's exactly as this piece suggests
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.480]   that if in the process of discovery
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.720]   you were using these tools to auto delete it,
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.360]   you were going to not have a presumption of innocence there.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.120]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.160]   This is federal civil court guidelines
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.320]   enabled judges to tell jurors that you can presume information
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   covered up by a litigate and now missing would have been negative.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.520]   So the presumption is, well, whatever it was, it was bad.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.120]   I think when we talk about police departments having body
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.880]   cameras, a lot of the time that footage ends up missing.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.040]   I think this is sort of a similar problem,
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.240]   that when that goes, I think we need
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.360]   to have this presumption legal in the legal sense,
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.240]   this legal presumption that something was there.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:35.000]   For my husband's profession, he does patent law for a living.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.800]   They worry about this a lot, data retention.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.840]   Because if you could legally prove that the person that you're
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.040]   suing for patent infringement knowingly
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.960]   infringed on your patent, then it's
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.360]   triple damages at that point.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.720]   So if you're talking about biotech,
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.720]   that's just a mind-bogglingly huge number.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.120]   So I think the important thing to really define here
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.080]   is the legal presumption that you have something
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.200]   to hide in this case, because you're never
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.720]   going to be able to go through and say, OK, you can use Slack,
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.720]   you can use Snapchat, you can use this or that
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.480]   tool.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.960]   I think it's got to be up to each individual company
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.440]   to very carefully keep their records.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.760]   And most big companies, their IT departments--
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.680]   well, let me drop the word most there.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:25.640]   A lot of big companies, their IT departments,
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.120]   they take into account things like retention policies.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:35.040]   For example, my company, we use exchange for email
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.320]   and Skype for Business for our chat, our internal corporate chat.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.240]   So we're supposed to use these tools.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.320]   And the IT department has whatever.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.400]   I'm not sure exactly how what their policies are
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.560]   as far as how long they keep it.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.040]   But they do have those kinds of policies in place.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.600]   And we've been specifically told not
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.200]   to use things like Slack for work-related communities.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.160]   Because it'll be comp preserved.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.440]   Well, because they don't have to--
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.400]   Because they don't have to--
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.880]   Voice conversation or a phone call, none of that's preserved.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.320]   If you really want to be private, talk in person
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.280]   or talk on the phone.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.320]   I think that's what people often do is--
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:15.840]   Yes.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.240]   They'll walk over and talk to somebody in person
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.760]   instead of writing an email or sending a text message.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.800]   Yes, I mean, I don't know about you guys,
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.200]   but I've done things that I don't think would ever
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.000]   be the--
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.640]   I've been in work situations where I don't think
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.440]   our conversation or anything about it would have ever
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.080]   been the subject of a lawsuit.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.760]   But we've been texting or iaming or emailing back and forth.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.200]   And we just--
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.880]   You want to pick up the phone or you want to walk over to X?
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.440]   Because it's just--
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.040]   Just don't leave a paper trail.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.720]   I mean, sometimes it's paper trail.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.520]   Sometimes it's actually just a lot easier to just walk over
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.800]   and you can hash things out a lot more quickly that way.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:03.280]   Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely a real concern.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.160]   Let's take a little break.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.960]   Having some fun with this panel.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.040]   Sam is here from Navigant.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.520]   He's-- Sam Aboule-Somid is an automotive expert,
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.240]   gave us a ride in the new Nissan Leaf.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:16.880]   Really liked that.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.960]   That was a lot of fun.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.880]   And actually, we should talk about the state of the art
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   in self-driving vehicles, electric vehicles,
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.360]   all the future of driving.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.000]   Since you've covered that on your podcast,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.640]   I'd love to spend some time on that.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:32.080]   Also, Brianna Wu from Rocket and Giant Space Cat
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.000]   and candidate for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   When's the primary?
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.160]   It's not set yet.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.640]   So in February, we have to--
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.840]   So my next step is in February, they will give me a ballot.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.120]   And then at that point, if I go out and get,
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.720]   I believe it's 2,000 signatures on it,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.720]   then the Massachusetts Democratic Party
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.280]   will agree to put the ballot with Stephen Lynch.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.160]   So that is my next step to wait for the Massachusetts Democratic
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.600]   Party to give me that.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   Good.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.520]   Well, we're going to believe me talked to you before then,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.160]   but we're going to stay in touch.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.320]   Whatever we can do to mobilize the Massachusetts 8th,
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.280]   the twit army in the Massachusetts 8th,
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.760]   there's got to be a few people there.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.880]   See, you're joking.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.280]   I have talked to so many people through being on Twitter.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.880]   It's always great for my campaign.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.200]   Good.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.880]   You'll be our first member of Congress
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.600]   that we've elected.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.040]   That's good.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Also with us, Christina Warren, who's the president of everybody's
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.760]   favorite '90s TV shows.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.120]   I don't know.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.240]   Senior Cloud developer, Abaca.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.840]   Microsoft, she's @film_girl on the Twitter.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.080]   How's the Microsoft thing going?
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.000]   You enjoying yourself?
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.600]   You're on channel 9 now.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.680]   I am on channel 9 now.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.880]   We're doing a lot of good stuff.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.080]   And yeah, no, it's been really good so far.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.200]   It's still really different, getting used to a new career.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.120]   But I'm enjoying it.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.320]   I work with some great people.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.680]   And there's lots of people in the West Coast.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.520]   Because I know that was one of the stopping points.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.280]   You really wanted to stay in New York with Grant.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.400]   I really wanted to stay in New York.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.440]   But he really, really likes it down here.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.200]   And he was always, I think.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.880]   He never loved New York quite the way I did.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.080]   But he really, really likes it out here.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.840]   So that's good.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.440]   Yeah, we have the same kind of problem.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.200]   I love New York.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.280]   I was born there.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.360]   We were just back there Wednesday and Thursday
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.640]   for my birthday.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.880]   First time I'd been there since I was a baby on my birthday.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.760]   I've been there, but not on my birthday.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.960]   It says Happy Birthday.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.040]   Thank you.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.920]   But Lisa's not a fan of New York.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.040]   She says, and this puzzles me because I think New York smells great.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.560]   She says she's like, I would smell.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.040]   Do you ever notice that?
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.280]   New York is a very alive city.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.120]   I love New York.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.080]   This is fine walking around Manhattan.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.200]   I get energy.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.880]   Listening to the sounds.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.680]   I was there in April for The Auto Show.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.880]   And just walking around the city.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.440]   I can't even fathom what that city would be like
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.760]   if all the cars were replaced by autonomous electric cars.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.040]   I mean, we just totally changed the character of the city.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:00.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   No, without the sound, you're right.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.920]   I don't even know how that would happen.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.600]   I was there two weeks ago for Microsoft Connect.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.320]   And I hung out with a bunch of people.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.720]   And I'm going to be there next weekend for a couple of days
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.520]   because a good friend of mine is getting married.
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.280]   But yeah, you're right.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.400]   So I don't know how it would be if the noise went away.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.040]   In fact, one of the weird things when we were in Bellevue
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.680]   for the first two months here, there wasn't,
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.600]   it was like being back.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.160]   It was so, yes.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.320]   - It's a struggle, it's crazy.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.160]   - I couldn't deal.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.000]   I couldn't deal.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.320]   So one of the reasons we moved to Capitol Hill,
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.640]   which is where I live now in Seattle,
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.760]   is because it is an actual city.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.720]   And especially a weekend, it gets loud.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.160]   And then for me, I was like, oh, finally I can sleep,
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.720]   you know, because, or I was like, what is this?
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.280]   I don't know how to deal without the sounds
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.440]   of the city around.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.960]   - Well, I have an app for the iPhone
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.080]   that will have its background noise for sleeping.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.080]   And it has not only, you know, wind and rain and wind chimes.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.880]   It also has loud street sounds.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.800]   And so I was using, we were using the wind and rain
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.320]   when we were, 'cause we stayed crazily.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.520]   I don't know why on Times Square.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.080]   So it was very noisy the whole time.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.000]   I love that.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.960]   I just, I feel like I'm at home.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.880]   I have to say though, there's 40,000,
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.360]   the cab he told us is 40,000 cab,
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.560]   40,000 medallions on the New York City streets.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.320]   And I don't know, untold numbers of lifts and ubers.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.160]   - Yep.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.480]   - Driving in New York, you just take the subway, right?
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.800]   You wouldn't drive somewhere in New York.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.520]   - I mean, I would take Uber's lifts, the cabs in subway.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.700]   I would do come in. - It's been prepared
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.240]   for a long drive.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.120]   - Oh yeah, no, totally.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.040]   I mean, and look, but I'll be honest, I mean,
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.600]   I calculated how much money I'd spent on Uber over,
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.200]   like between 2011 and I think 2016.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.600]   And I think it was 20, I think it was $24,000 I think.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.400]   - But that's cheaper than a car.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.600]   Without it out it is, but that's just Uber.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.520]   I'm not counting, you know, cab.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.360]   That was just Uber.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.800]   But even then still way cheaper than a car,
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.040]   because I had this problem and I gained a little bit of weight
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.960]   and I lost it all, but I think there were a few things
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.840]   that went into that and I think part of it was
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.880]   because the subway wasn't that close to my apartment.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.760]   I would just take an Uber in the morning.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.200]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.640]   - And that would work, but I would work in the back of the car.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.120]   See, this is why I can't wait for self-drive cars.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.040]   - This will make you feel at home.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:17.880]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.200]   (laughing)
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.040]   - Could've fallen asleep.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.480]   - They'll work in the back seat of the cab.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.320]   - Well, I do.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.400]   - That's a rainy city street, yeah.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.680]   - Rainy city street, that's still south.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.680]   - You need honking horns for all the cab.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.760]   - You need honking horns, yeah,
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.520]   you need people screaming obscenities.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.840]   - Yep.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.040]   - Got that, I have to have fire alarms.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.280]   - Yeah, fire engines.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.600]   - Fire alarm.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.280]   But you know, you need the cabby to just pull over suddenly
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.120]   and you don't know what's happening.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.360]   He says, I have to go to the bathroom
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.440]   and you're like, okay.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.000]   - That happened to be my first week in New York.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.200]   Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, there's a certain ambiance there.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.480]   But no, I know people, and I have friends who live
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.720]   in Brooklyn who own a car and I have people,
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   I know friends who maybe even live in the city
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.280]   and have a car, I never could, I would never do it.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.640]   - No, no, no, no, I could get more garage.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.000]   - Yeah, I mean, garage in Manhattan.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.360]   - I could cost you a thousand bucks a month.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.640]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.600]   - He's like, or he can cheat it, like I did.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.840]   When I first moved to Boston,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.680]   that's when I got my Honda CBR 600 RR motorcycle
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.000]   because you can park it for free.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.720]   Like at a, we parked it behind my first department building
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.320]   then traffic doesn't affect you
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.920]   because you can just drive like for staying still traffic.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.560]   Yeah, yeah, you just go between people, it's awesome.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.200]   - You're one of those lane splitting people, huh?
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.760]   - I am, I have good safety gear, so.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   - That worries me, I just feel very--
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.120]   - Even after all these years coming to California
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.760]   and driving here, I still get freaked out
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.600]   when a motorcycle comes in and has my show.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.600]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.680]   Wow.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   - I'm sure Seattle's bikes.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.200]   They're bikes everywhere.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.200]   And I see, like, and you know, they don't always follow
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.720]   the proper route things sometimes.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.960]   And so my husband will be driving and all of a sudden,
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.320]   like, you know, the same thing, like where you'll be surprised
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.000]   by motorcycle, but instead you've got a cyclist
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.600]   and you're like, oh, okay, okay.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.440]   Hold up.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.560]   - We had a great week this week on Twitter.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.920]   I skipped out on a Tuesday, skipped out early,
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.440]   but thanks to Robert Ballis there
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.360]   and Jason Howell who filled in for me.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.200]   Here's some of the things I missed.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.640]   You might have to watch.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:17.760]   - Previously on Twitter.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.120]   - Can you see how it is?
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.760]   - You can. - Yeah.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.920]   - My ears are too big.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.760]   Oh, there you go.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.480]   (laughing)
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.760]   - iOS today.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.760]   - This year we're gonna stay fit during the holidays.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.320]   This is called the MPAD
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.400]   and you stand on it and you can gamify your workout.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.280]   - The new screen savers.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.760]   You do this for fun, but now it's become a business for you.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.520]   - Yeah, it's really a hobby that's just completely
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.520]   gotten out of control.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.520]   - Yes, there's a Shikai Broraiser.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.400]   (laughing)
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.680]   And by the way, thank you for being very patient.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.840]   You can go to the bathroom now.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.160]   - To it, it's time to see Leo in the cat suit.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.480]   (laughing)
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480]   - Oh, this is great.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   - I noticed some.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.720]   (laughing)
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.720]   - You can see out of it.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.720]   - You can see out of it.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.560]   - Yeah.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.120]   - This is like, can you do an entire show like that, Leo?
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.760]   - Ah, sure.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.600]   - That's his red versus blue helmet.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.440]   - I don't think it's coming off.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.400]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.840]   Oh yeah, I don't think it's coming off.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.680]   - Uh oh.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.520]   - Well, anyway.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.680]   (laughing)
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.920]   - You can check in, but you just can't check out our show
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.480]   today brought to you by Jams.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.400]   J-A-M-F, if you're a Mac person, you're an Apple person.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.240]   If any kind, you probably know Jams, if you're an IT.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.520]   Absolutely, you know Jams.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.960]   The problem is, you know, if your business is small,
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.920]   as ours was when you first started out,
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.640]   you have a couple of iPads, the iPhones, a couple of Macs,
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.240]   it's easy to keep track, but as you grow,
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.960]   you buy more equipment for your employees and your staff,
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.920]   and it gets harder to keep track of everything.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.920]   Plus, you know, there's line of business apps
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.800]   you want to install, there's security.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.680]   What if they get lost, figuring out how to secure
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.040]   a lost iPhone or iPad?
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.680]   Well, Jams, now, that's the solution.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.120]   Everybody who's running a department
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.720]   with multiple Apple products has got to find out about it.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.080]   It makes management tasks so much simpler.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.200]   Deploying Wi-Fi passwords, securing company data.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.680]   Enforcing passcodes.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.960]   And now that you know really that a six digit passcode's
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.320]   not enough, you could say, nope,
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.000]   can have a longer password on your iPhone.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.960]   Simple, it's affordable too.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.840]   You can easily set up devices with exactly the same settings,
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.800]   accounts and applications.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:29.520]   No more passing a sticky note with a Wi-Fi password on it.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.920]   Remotely configure settings like Wi-Fi passwords
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.080]   and email account information,
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:36.920]   protect sensitive information, lock or wipe a device.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.320]   Jams now allows you to centrally deploy apps,
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.680]   view device details.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.040]   And of course get a 360 degree view of your inventory.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.200]   You don't have to be an IT wizard to use Jamf now.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   In fact, it's used by a lot of companies.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.120]   Instead of having an IT department,
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.400]   you can set up, manage and protect your Apple devices
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.480]   easily in minutes, focus on your business,
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.560]   but keep track of your assets.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.440]   Watch your assets, as they say.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.760]   Start securing your business today with Jamf now.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.040]   This is the new product.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.880]   Go to Jamf.jaf.com/twit, create your free Jamf now account,
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.240]   manage your first three devices free forever.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.320]   And if you need more, just add devices
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.920]   up to just $2 a month per device, very simple.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.320]   Easy flat right pricing.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.480]   Jamf.jaf.com/twit.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.440]   You gotta try the new Jamf now platform.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.240]   It's very easy, very fast, very affordable.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.200]   It's a must for apples in businesses.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.680]   Jamf.com/twit.
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.720]   I know a lot of our chat room folks use Jamf
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.360]   and our big fans of Jamf.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.400]   Does anybody, okay, so it was my birthday, right?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.720]   And a week before your birthday, Facebook says,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.880]   okay, what charity do you wanna donate to?
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.160]   Yes. Does that bug you?
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.000]   Yup. I did it this time.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.240]   I know you did. I saw that you did.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.920]   I didn't give you a cent.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.280]   That's fine.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.320]   But in much respect, what kind of bothered me about it
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.360]   was that I had relatives who wanted to do stuff,
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.040]   and then Facebook wouldn't let them,
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.840]   but there wasn't an easy way for them to donate
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.600]   without giving Facebook their credit card information.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.720]   They didn't have a PayPal account.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.640]   And so I was like, oh, well, that kinda sucks.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.480]   Like it would have been better
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.680]   if they could have just gone directly to,
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.680]   in my case, the ACLU's website,
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.920]   and donated to the ACLU.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.920]   But yeah.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.040]   Just send out an email to everybody you know and say,
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.000]   here's a link to the ACLU hours,
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   send money, whatever your organization of choice.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   I think I should find the bar.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.960]   Yeah, that's exactly what bothers me.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:30.960]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.800]   Go ahead.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.440]   No. After you, Brianna.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.120]   Okay, so I was just gonna say that's what bothers me.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.000]   It's another ploy for Facebook to get all this data
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.320]   in the name of charity.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.200]   And as long as we're talking about this,
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.200]   I'm always so frustrated that so many businesses in Boston
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.200]   do the same thing.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.920]   Like they've outsourced their corporate charity giving
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.280]   to the employees of the companies.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.120]   If you go to like a grocery store here,
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.840]   they'll ask you to donate to some Red Sox fund.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.920]   And 20 years ago,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.760]   that would be that corporation that would donate that money
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:07.000]   to the Red Sox charity.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.200]   Instead, they're outsourcing it for you.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.640]   And that bothers me.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.120]   And now to see Facebook using as another ploy
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.520]   to get Christina's grandparents data.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.840]   It's just obnoxious.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.840]   Don't you feel a little screwy criticizing it?
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.600]   Like, well, this is charity.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.440]   Well, you know what?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.280]   Instead of that.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.280]   That's what Facebook's up to.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.520]   Instead of taking the easy way out online,
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.840]   do what a friend of ours does.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.680]   Her birthday last year, every year for her birthday,
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:33.480]   instead of having a party and inviting everybody over
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.800]   and everybody's sitting around drinking,
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.720]   she picks someplace and goes and does some activity.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.400]   Like this year, for example,
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.880]   we had 20 people went to local women's shelter in Ann Arbor.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.720]   - Nice.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.720]   - Or a better women's shelter.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.760]   And we completely redid the laundry room.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.640]   We cleaned everything up, pulled all the machines out,
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.560]   repainted, patched all the holes in the walls.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.600]   We spent about four hours doing this.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.080]   So did some productive work activity
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.160]   and do something analog.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.720]   Instead of clicking, just clicking on something
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.080]   to send 10 bucks here or 20 bucks there,
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.000]   do something real for a change.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:11.820]   - I like it.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.040]   Work at a soup kitchen.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.520]   - Yeah, whatever it might be.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.640]   Go somewhere where they need some help.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.480]   - It's good for you too.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.520]   - And do something, yeah.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.200]   - So, okay, good.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.800]   So I don't feel so bad.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.080]   'Cause I didn't do it.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.240]   And you feel guilty if you don't do it.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.280]   - I felt kind of guilty to doing it.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.160]   And then I was just like,
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.840]   and our corporate giving campaign was a couple weeks
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.680]   before my birthday.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.520]   And so I gave money through that.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.680]   But I felt guilty, but at the same time,
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.720]   I figured I'd try it just to see.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.360]   I was like, yeah, I'll see if I could raise money
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.200]   for the ACLU.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.120]   But, you know.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.200]   - I give them 100 bucks a month just for fun.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.000]   I like those sustaining ones.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.320]   'Cause then you feel,
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.960]   I think it's good for the charities too,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.840]   'cause they know they have a kind of
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.040]   continual stream of income.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.600]   But I have to be fair, Brianna.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.120]   Every time when I was a kid,
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.320]   we went to Fenway Park.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.680]   There's always the little can for the Jimmy Fund.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.080]   That's a long-standing Boston tradition.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.640]   - Are you a Red Sox fan?
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.720]   - Hell yeah.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.080]   - Aw, awesome.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.240]   I didn't know that about you.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.680]   - Well, I grew up in Rhode Island.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.520]   I grew up in Providence.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.360]   That was the local team.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.200]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.320]   - Yeah. - Wow, wow.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.240]   - Remember the Jimmy Fund?
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.200]   Do they still do that at Fenway?
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.040]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:21.880]   - I think they did the last time I was there,
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:22.720]   which was a while ago they did.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.880]   - Have you ever seen the Pawtucket Red Sox?
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.440]   - Oh yeah. - They're the minor league team.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.840]   That is the best time
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.520]   that we love going out there.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.480]   That is amazing.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.040]   - We used to have a team in the area.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.120]   They were the crushes,
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.520]   'cause it's a wine country.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.920]   (laughing)
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.120]   And they were not,
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.000]   they weren't even single-A ball.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.600]   These guys were like carpenters during the day,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.640]   and then they would come in there.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.360]   But it was fun,
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.360]   and actually one of the great giants,
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.240]   Batter's, Kevin Mitchell, was the coach for a while,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.000]   till he threw a chair a little too hard.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.320]   (laughing)
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.160]   So maybe you should move on, Kevin.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.960]   But the fun thing about these minor league teams
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.040]   is the promotions they do in between innings,
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.960]   'cause they are so cheesy.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.800]   We always,
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.840]   they would have one where they'd get a bunch of kids.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.240]   It's just like between the fifth and sixth inning.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.360]   And they'd put a bat on home base,
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.560]   and they'd make the kid put his forehead on the bat,
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.360]   and spin around,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.840]   spin around, spin around,
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.720]   'cause he got really dizzy,
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.320]   and then see if he could run to first base.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.880]   That was the entertainment.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.720]   - Yup.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:25.560]   (laughing)
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.680]   - I'd rather watch that
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.640]   than most of the Super Bowl halftime show.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:29.480]   (laughing)
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.640]   - Yes, you're right.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.560]   - Great, great fun.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.000]   Those were the days, my friends.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.840]   All right, let's see.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:36.840]   What else is going on?
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.400]   Jeff Bezos, sad to say,
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.480]   no longer worth $100 billion.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.320]   We should now--
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.080]   - He's having a three-comma club though.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.120]   - Is he in the three-comma club?
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.680]   Yeah, he's definitely a billionaire.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.920]   - Jeez.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.760]   - That's all really matter.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.600]   - Jeez.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   - He's in the four-comma club.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.640]   You know,
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.240]   as long as you're in three, you're good.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.520]   - This is a great Tom McKay writing a gizmodo,
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.000]   your old stomping ass.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:58.840]   - Yes.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.560]   - A lot of his such a good writer.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.880]   - Alas, the brightest stars burn shortest,
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.000]   and this tale of hubris is collided with a tragic end.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.880]   A Wednesday wipeout saw Bezos plummet
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.280]   from his $100 billion throne,
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.240]   with a single day loss in Amazon shares
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.120]   of $2.5 billion.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.240]   Our sweet market destroying angel
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.880]   simply have to make two with his $97.5 billion for now.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:22.720]   - Oh.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.560]   - Oh.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.400]   - Oh.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.920]   - Okay, so it's poor guy, poor guy.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.840]   - Okay, Congress will make up the difference
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.680]   with the taxes.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.520]   - Yeah.
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.840]   - What do you think his tax break will be?
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.800]   See, that would drive Trump crazy though.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.640]   - I don't think,
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.200]   I don't think Bezos pays taxes.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.040]   - Yeah.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.920]   Nobody at that level pays taxes.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:39.760]   - That's why I'm telling you that's why.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.440]   - If you're a billionaire and you're paying taxes,
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.280]   you're doing so.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.840]   You need to hire better advisors.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.280]   - Leo, can we talk about that Bitcoin story there?
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.640]   - Because I have to thank you for that story,
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.360]   because Bitcoin hit $10,000 for Bitcoin.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.640]   And the last time, it was two times ago,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.520]   I was on your show.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.520]   And the author of the book about Silk Road,
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.760]   Nick Denton, Nick Milton, rather.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760]   - Nick Denton, yes.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.200]   - He was on here.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.440]   And I read that book, I absolutely loved it,
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.800]   I devoured it, we talked about it on Rocket.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.000]   And I, on a whim after I read that book,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.200]   I bought $200 of Bitcoins.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.520]   And now I have $2,000 takes to coming on your show.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.680]   - You're kidding me.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.240]   - Thank you very much, I am not.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.720]   - I would sell it quickly.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.560]   (laughing)
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.400]   - Do you think so?
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.240]   Do you think so?
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.360]   - By the way, Nick is now like,
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.280]   he'll never be on this show again, a superstar.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.800]   He's writing two movie deals now.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.160]   - He's got two, he's writing scripts.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.080]   He is, yeah.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.200]   He's like, he's Mr. Hollywood now.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.040]   - That's amazing.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.280]   - Yeah.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.640]   - And American Kingpin, which was the one,
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.520]   the book he had just published, I think is,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.200]   I think that's option, I know that Twitter book is optioned.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.520]   - Twitter book's an option.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.080]   I'm sure that the Silk Road book is optioned.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.680]   - I think he's writing that script.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.000]   He's the next Aaron Sorkin.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.600]   Good for you, Nick.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.680]   - He's great.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.920]   - So Bitcoin did cross 10,000, is it still that high?
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.760]   I can't.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.320]   - Then it crossed 11,000, and then Coinbase,
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.200]   and a few other things crashed.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.040]   - Wow.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.200]   - And it dropped.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.360]   - If you wanna hear a sad story, I'll give you a sad story.
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.400]   I have seven Bitcoin, but I don't remember
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.240]   the password wallet.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.080]   - Oh no.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.920]   - I wanna hear my sad story.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.520]   I bought Bitcoin when it was $10 a Bitcoin,
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.600]   and then I was forced to liquidate it
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.720]   when it was $800 a Bitcoin, which was still a look,
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.760]   a big profit, I'm not saying it wasn't.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.720]   But imagine now how much.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.320]   - How many coins did you have, do you remember?
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:34.160]   - Like 12.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.240]   - Jeez, Louise.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:36.080]   - Oh my God.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.880]   - I can top all of that.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.520]   Steve Gibson, the host of our security show.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.520]   We were talking about Bitcoin,
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.640]   and he decided to set up a Bitcoin miner.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.200]   This was some years ago, when anybody,
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.040]   it was easy.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.400]   You couldn't have to have a nuclear power plant next to you
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.480]   to do it.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.360]   And the first night, it drops 50 Bitcoins,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.960]   which would be worth $500,000 right now.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.120]   He also can't remember the password.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:03.960]   - Oh no.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.560]   - Well, I also think about the guy who made
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.760]   the original Bitcoin purchase,
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.440]   he bought the pizza and I think he paid like 20 Bitcoin
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.720]   or 50 Bitcoin or something.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.560]   - Oh yeah, the multi-million dollar pizza.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.720]   - You know, because he said that's how much,
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:16.560]   how much it paid for?
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.400]   - 20,000 Bitcoin?
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.240]   - Yeah.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.120]   - Yeah, I think he paid like 20 Bitcoin
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.280]   or 50 Bitcoin or something.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.120]   And anyway.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.040]   - 20,000 Bitcoins, Brian.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.680]   - 20,000 Bitcoins.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.160]   - 20,000 Bitcoins, oh my gosh.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.400]   - For a pizza.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.960]   - For a pizza, so that would have been literally.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.120]   - For two pizzas, all right, well that's different.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:32.960]   - For two pizzas.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.800]   - Oh my God.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.640]   - 10,000 coins.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.720]   - If it's good pizza.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.560]   - Well, that's a deal.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.400]   - I can't even do the math.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.960]   - That's 11,000 times 10,000.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.960]   I don't even know, that's like billions.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.480]   So one of the interesting things about Bitcoin
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.760]   is the number of Bitcoin that is,
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.560]   the amount of Bitcoins just disappeared.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.400]   - Yep.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.240]   - Yep.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.040]   - Because of people like me who've, you know,
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.080]   lost their wallets or forgotten their wallets,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.840]   stuff that's been stolen.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.120]   - Or I was gonna say the theft.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.200]   I mean, we all know Mt. Gox is the most high profile one,
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.880]   but there have been so many Bitcoin scams over the year.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.480]   And in fact, that was my original kind of on-tray
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:07.920]   into kind of getting interested in Bitcoin
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.280]   was the drama around like the Bitcoin scam artists.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.000]   If I'm being completely like candid,
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.160]   like that was the most fascinating thing is all the people,
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.120]   even before ICOs became like modern Ponzi schemes,
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.200]   there were Ponzi schemes happening in like Bitcoin funds,
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.120]   you know, like, you know, four or five years ago.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.280]   And it's a big guy, you're right,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.160]   it is really interesting to see how much of it
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.360]   has disappeared because people have either lost it
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.880]   or stuff has disappeared off of different wallets
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.400]   or, you know, exchanges have been hacked.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.200]   I mean, it's, there's no telling.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.360]   It's really interesting.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360]   - Among the Bitcoin law can presume to be lost forever
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.480]   is the billions of dollars in Bitcoin owned by its creators.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.120]   Satoshi Nakamoto, Nakamoto's kind of disappeared
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.040]   off the face of the earth.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.920]   We don't know if it's a person or multiple people,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.560]   what their real names are,
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.440]   or whether they still have access to those Bitcoins.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.240]   They've not really forgotten them in any way.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.080]   Maybe they forgot.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.000]   (imitates
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.520]   "Ooh")
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.760]   - Ooh, that would be bad.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.360]   A related story, of course,
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.320]   a coin hive, which is a website,
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.000]   and there are a number of these
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.960]   that offer JavaScript resources for websites.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.160]   - Oh God, these are so bad.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.400]   - That we want to mine Bitcoin on your browser.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.120]   - Mine Bitcoin on your browser, using JavaScript.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.320]   Typically, actually, they're mining, I think Ethereum.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.760]   - Yeah, yeah, you're usually doing Ethereum.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.840]   - I can't get in because my, thank goodness,
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.920]   my blocker is keeping me off coin hive.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.520]   - Have you set up your Tesla to mine some coin for you?
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.840]   - Could my Tesla mine coin?
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.840]   That would be awesome.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.040]   - Ah, I think I have a different opinion.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:44.880]   - I think I have a different opinion.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.440]   - A guy with a Model S that set up a mining rig.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.280]   - What?
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.840]   - In the back of his car and led into superchargers
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.920]   to use the free power from superchargers
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.920]   to run a mining rig.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.400]   - Okay, that's smart using the free power,
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.040]   because at this point, all the mining is happening in China.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.800]   So anybody trying to even do anything for,
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.280]   for anybody there, exactly.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.160]   - And they're mostly next to hydroelectric dams
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.080]   and ice is back run by quasai governmental folks.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:10.920]   - Oh, probably.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.120]   - Yeah, who are getting free power.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.680]   Otherwise, it makes no sense, yeah.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.040]   - But back in the old days, you'd buy X number of GPUs
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.080]   and you'd have to figure out how much does my power bill cost
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.280]   and how much is Bitcoin worth?
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.920]   And is it gonna be worth running all this 24/7?
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.200]   'Cause at one point, my husband was looking at
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.720]   getting into mining operations.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.360]   And I was like, you're never going to do it
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.480]   in quantities where it will matter
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.000]   and the Chinese are taking over anyway.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.920]   In retrospect, I mean, maybe I should have encouraged him
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.920]   to spend $600 a month on power to do it,
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920]   but who knows?
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.840]   Who's to say?
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.280]   - We have a friend, Steve Gibson,
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.040]   I have a friend who lives in Arizona
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.600]   where power is cheap and has made,
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.120]   kind of made a living mining Bitcoin in his garage
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.880]   with very fancy advanced asic machines and so forth.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.120]   But I think because of course, part of the way that this works
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.040]   and this is the brilliance of Nakamoto
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.160]   is as more because generated, it's harder and harder
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.240]   to solve these mathematic problems.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.960]   And so it requires more hardware, more power
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.120]   and that's how it's supposed to be.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.680]   By the way, it's not Ethereum, it's Monero,
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.960]   it's another cryptocurrency.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.680]   - I have to say, I have a different opinion
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.960]   than y'all do about this.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.080]   I think that websites have to find a way to monetize
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.240]   the stuff that they're putting out there.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.880]   And the current way to do that,
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.320]   like even huge sites like Vox do this,
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.640]   like they put all these ad trackers
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.040]   and they basically sell your data
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.800]   to whoever they can give it to and do it with that.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.520]   If I had to choose between using my computational power
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.120]   to like give them X number of cycles
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.760]   to like solve these cryptocurrency problems,
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.880]   I would so much rather do that
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.040]   than have like everybody and their mother
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.480]   spying on my browsing habits.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.360]   - Yeah, but to do, before you do that,
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:01.560]   you definitely want, they need to be upfront,
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.400]   they need to be candid about what they're doing.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:04.240]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:07.600]   - Just like in the days when people were running
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.840]   SETI at home or folding, protein folding,
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.000]   at least if you know what you're getting into, that's fine.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.880]   But I think the problem is these guys are being just as,
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:20.560]   they're doing this behind the scenes
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.720]   without telling you just like the trackers are.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.760]   - Right, and what's starting to happen too
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.440]   is that I've noticed this is that people are buying
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.600]   like WordPress plugins that have X number of installs
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.360]   and they're going to people and they're requiring them
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.120]   and saying, hey, I'll give you X amount of money.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.760]   And then they're updating the WordPress plugins
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.040]   to basically include this sort of thing.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.360]   So people are putting it on their websites
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.800]   and then unknowingly having these Bitcoin or not Bitcoin,
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.080]   but you know, having these crypto mining operations
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.120]   happening on their sites and then they don't know why.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.920]   Their sites are slower why people are complaining
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.440]   and have no clue that they're aiding all of this.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.080]   So I mean, I think that there's something to be said
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.440]   if you were making that part of your explicit business model
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.040]   that says rather than showing ads, we're going to be doing this
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.440]   and that's something that they use.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.160]   - Would it be okay if they said it explicitly
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.000]   and you agreed?
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:05.920]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:08.200]   - I mean, it would depend on the content at the site.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.040]   I mean, I don't know if I would agree with it.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.120]   But I mean, it would depend on the resources it would take,
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:13.960]   right?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.120]   Because in some cases, the resources on certain websites
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.240]   are so ridiculous, especially on level.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.080]   - Well, that's kind of it.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.400]   You're already just explaining if they had flash ads
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.000]   your CPU would be--
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.720]   - Right, and so it depends.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.920]   I mean, on the one hand, you could say,
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.320]   oh, well, if they were doing it in moderation,
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.240]   but of course, as we've seen with ads and trackers
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.920]   and all that, no one will do anything in moderation.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.280]   So I don't know.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.000]   I mean, I still think that what you'll have
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.920]   is there will still be a contention of people
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.480]   using blockers and whatnot.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.680]   I will say this though, and I know this will be really unpopular
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.760]   and I don't really care.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.240]   I have a problem with browsers like Brave that are,
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.600]   if you want to actively block ads
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.400]   and you want to make that part of what your browser thing is,
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.440]   do it, whatever.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.440]   But I have a problem with Brave who blocks the ads
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.080]   and then has people bought pain into its ICO
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.040]   and then says, oh, well, you can give money to websites
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.000]   and as long as they sign up for,
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.800]   as long as they tell us that they've signed up
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.800]   then we'll give them the money that you choose to pay on.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.280]   I'm not a fan of that.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.120]   - Why don't you like that?
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.200]   'Cause I thought that was a really good idea.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.000]   - Because I feel like that puts the onus on the site owner
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.920]   to have to then reach through a million hoops
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:24.120]   and sign up and say, here's my information
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.520]   and now you get payment.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.560]   I also, if I'm being completely honest,
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.080]   I have a problem with a company
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.840]   who's raising money through an ICO
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:32.200]   and then their main business model
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.240]   is to deprive revenue from other people.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.800]   - Yeah, I mean, what Brave was doing
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.000]   is not that much different from what's pocket originally
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.760]   back when they were still reading it later.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.800]   I mean, they had a similar kind of business model
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.760]   and other sites that have done similar types of things.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.040]   As Christina said, you're putting the onus
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.040]   on the site operator to reach out
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.160]   and go through all these hoops in order to get the money.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.880]   I prefer something like what Google was doing
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:02.960]   with the contributor. - Google contributor.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:03.880]   I like that. - Yeah.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.680]   You're just paying an amount of money every month
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.520]   and basically-- - I did this.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.480]   Yeah, I was doing it at two until--
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.720]   - Why did Google stop?
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.640]   I don't know.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.280]   I think-- - Enough people must not have been doing it
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.720]   is the only thing I can ever.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.560]   - Probably, yeah.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.560]   Or too many people were doing it.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.160]   - Yeah, I mean, I was doing 10 bucks a month
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.480]   for a contributor and seeing pictures of my dog pop up
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.640]   instead of ads.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.200]   I'd rather see my dog than most of these ads that pop up.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.040]   - I like that. - Yeah.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:30.320]   I mean, this is the problem is it's not a vacuum.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.840]   You're operating in a world where people
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.080]   are running ad blockers pretty routinely.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:34.960]   - Yes, far.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.800]   And so you're talking like-- - We're trying
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:38.000]   to find a way around that.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.720]   - Right, and that's fine.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.720]   And like I said, if you wanna have an ad blocker,
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.880]   I mean, I have the same issue with some of the adblock plus,
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:48.160]   which is part of an ad consortium
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.600]   and has the white list, right?
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.280]   Exactly.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.120]   It's like if you're gonna do that, do that.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.360]   But I have a problem if you're raising money,
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.880]   if you're raising VC funding and if you're raising an ICO,
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.480]   and the whole impetus of your product
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.760]   is to get rid of trackers, get rid of advertising.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.840]   And then you're saying, oh, well,
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.440]   even though we're depriving revenue from all these websites,
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.040]   we want our users to be able to give to them,
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.960]   but you have to jump through these hoops to get it.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.000]   Oh, and you have to have a minimum amount
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.080]   to get the money out and those things.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.240]   It rubs me the wrong way.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.640]   - Well, what's the alternative?
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.680]   I mean, more and more people are using ad blockers, effectively.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.240]   - I mean, I think I have it separate, I mean, exactly.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.640]   But I just, I feel like if you're,
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.800]   the whole point of your browser
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.040]   where you're raising funding and your hassle,
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.840]   you're making money, that's really where it comes to for me
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.960]   is you're making money off of depriving
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:31.800]   and come from other people.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:35.840]   Like you're making that choice and then saying,
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.000]   oh, but we're going to give the money back,
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.800]   but it's gonna require every single site
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.320]   on the world to sign up and go through all these.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.920]   Like it just, it doesn't pay off.
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:48.520]   And I doubt that the amount of money that they're collecting
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.320]   will ever be anything meaningful
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.480]   for even the biggest websites out there, even if--
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.280]   - I couldn't agree more on Christina.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.200]   And I think like you've really got to set the stakes here.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:58.880]   I mean, we saw another round
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.640]   of really devastating journalist layoffs this week.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.840]   That has consequences for our society,
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.200]   for how informed we are and the kind of, you know,
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.320]   non-clickbait news that gets made.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.960]   So, you know, these are really serious issues.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.120]   And I completely agree with what everyone's saying,
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.200]   like the informed consent that is the core issue here.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   I just think we're gonna have to find
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.520]   some alternative model for journalists
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.960]   and media content providers to get paid.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.440]   'Cause eventually, like we're gonna know so much
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.280]   about everyone, that the value of that YouTube
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.300]   is gonna be less and less and less.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:38.200]   - Supreme Court is going to hear a case
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.560]   that began with the armed robbery of a radio shack
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.560]   store in Detroit, just a couple weeks before Christmas 2010.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.240]   In the next three months, eight stores were in Michigan
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.920]   and Ohio were robbed at gunpoint.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.840]   The robbers took bags filled with smartphones.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:57.720]   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will consider
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.400]   whether prosecutors violated the Fourth Amendment.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.880]   That's the one against unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.360]   By collecting data from cell phone companies
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.880]   showing the movements of the man,
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.280]   they say organized the robberies.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:16.280]   So, aside from the guy, obviously, he's a crook.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:20.760]   But, this case, Carpenter v. United States
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:24.120]   is being considered by many, including Jeffrey Rosen,
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:27.280]   the president of the National Constitution Center,
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.600]   the most important electronic privacy case
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.960]   of the 21st century.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:34.800]   Effectively, it comes down to,
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.520]   should the police be able to access the GPS in your phone?
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.720]   And the way they do it, by the way,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.680]   is not through your phone.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.000]   They contact your cell phone company and say,
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.080]   and almost, I think all the cell phone companies
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.640]   have portals for law enforcement,
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.960]   where they charge a small amount,
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:52.920]   law enforcement can say, well, where was Leo Laporte
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.400]   on November 28th?
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.360]   Apple, Facebook, and Google,
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.280]   I'm reading from the New York Times article by Adam Liptech.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.600]   Apple, Google, and Facebook have filed amicus briefs
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.600]   urging the Supreme Court to bring Fourth Amendment law
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.440]   to the modern era.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.360]   No constitutional doctrine should presume
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.840]   that consumers assume the risk of warrantless
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.280]   government surveillance,
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.360]   just 'cause they use these technologies.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:20.800]   The court will decide by June.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:23.400]   The issue, I guess, is the Fourth Amendment
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.960]   is an 18th century solution.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.380]   This goes back to our conversation about encryption.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:33.640]   - And tracking, too.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.560]   - And tracking.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.720]   - And tracking. - Yeah.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:36.640]   - Yeah.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.040]   - Like, I say, Leo, like this is the most important story
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.680]   that we're talking about this week.
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:45.000]   I think everyone listening or watching a show would agree,
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.320]   we wanna get bad guys.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.680]   Like, we want law enforcement people
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.560]   to go and get a warrant, to be able to go before a judge,
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.960]   and get that information with pressure
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.800]   to law enforcement in putting bad guys in jail.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:00.000]   No one would disagree with that.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.680]   What this is about is the standards of proof
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:07.720]   that law enforcement has to bring before a judge
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.720]   to get basically huge reams of information about you.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.320]   So, yeah, this is very similar to the Apple San Bernardino case.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:22.320]   It's a situation where everybody wants the person
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:26.360]   to face legal consequences.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.560]   But if this decision goes through,
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.480]   the government will have the ability to go forward
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.240]   and present a very, very low burden of proof to a judge
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.480]   and be able to get all of your records.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.280]   - Is this what's called a pen warrant?
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.800]   - I don't know.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.280]   - So it doesn't, you don't need to go to a judge.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.640]   You don't need to get a warrant.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.880]   You need merely to go to the phone company,
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.640]   say, you know, I'm investigating a crime.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.640]   The cell phone companies turned over
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:59.520]   the defendant carpenters' cell phone records
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:04.520]   over 127 days, placing him at 12,898 locations.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:08.560]   Prosecutors could tell whether he had slept at home
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.600]   on a given night, whether he attended his usual church
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:14.800]   on Sunday morning, and in fact used that data
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.840]   to convict him and sentence him to 116 years in prison
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.400]   because that phone was nearby when several
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.960]   of the robberies happened.
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:25.720]   - And this is actually a really important case
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:29.040]   because this is gonna expand dramatically
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:32.280]   going back to my autonomous cars and connected cars thing.
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.960]   It's gonna expand dramatically because
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.920]   when you get into autonomous and connected cars,
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.680]   you're not gonna be buying those cars.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.880]   You're gonna be either subscribing to them
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.000]   or paying Alacarte.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.680]   They're gonna be available through mobility
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.040]   as a service models.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:48.280]   - Well, if I buy it, Elon knows everything I do in my car.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.880]   - So in the next couple of years,
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:55.520]   virtually 100% of new vehicles that are sold
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.800]   are gonna be equipped with telematic systems.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.600]   So you're gonna have a cell modem in virtually every new car.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.560]   And as you get into autonomous,
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:08.920]   there's gonna be monitors inside the vehicle
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.920]   that look at who's in there, who's riding around in there.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.280]   So there's gonna be way more information
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.960]   than we have even now, which is tracking a phone
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:19.880]   because there's gonna be cameras inside the vehicle
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.840]   that can see who's in there so they can know who to bill,
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.640]   who to authenticate.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.800]   And it's gonna, if with the phone,
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:29.800]   you don't know who's actually carrying that phone
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.600]   unless you have eyes on that individual carrying that phone.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.120]   But once you hop into an autonomous car
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:38.960]   to go for a ride across town,
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.040]   they're gonna know exactly who's in that car
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:41.880]   and where you're going.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:42.720]   - And we're not saying law enforcement
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.540]   shouldn't have access to this.
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:45.200]   We're saying they should have to go to a judge.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.320]   - Right, get a warrant.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.160]   - Exactly.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.920]   - They don't need to right now.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.240]   It's called a pen register.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.640]   And it comes from, I didn't know this,
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.080]   but a previous Supreme Court decisions
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.960]   like the 1979 Smith versus Maryland.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.560]   Supreme Court ruled a robbery suspect
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.920]   had no reasonable expectation to privacy,
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.960]   extended the numbers he dialed from his landline phone.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.880]   The reasoning is, well, you turned that information
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.840]   over to a third party, the phone company,
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.080]   when you dialed the phone.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.840]   So we can ask the phone company
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.040]   and you have no reasonable right to privacy there.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.640]   You will gate, this is the third party doctrine
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:24.640]   and governments and the government and courts
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.720]   have used this to justify seeking data
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.400]   from a cell phone company showing users movements.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.600]   So I don't think it's unfair and unreasonable to say,
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:36.400]   nah, this is really a lot of information
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.880]   you should need a warrant for it.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.720]   - Right.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:40.880]   - We don't know what the Supreme Court will do, however.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.720]   - Yeah.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:42.560]   - No, we don't.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:43.840]   And I think it's important too to point out,
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.720]   because some people say, oh, well,
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.120]   don't you wanna catch the bad guys?
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.200]   And why are you trying to, you know,
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.760]   fury what law enforcement's supposed to do?
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.440]   And it's important to remember that,
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.040]   like the Miranda case and many of our big,
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.720]   you know, fourth-minute cases,
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.360]   Miranda was not a good person.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:00.160]   That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be by your rights.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.760]   Just because someone is a robber
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.120]   and doesn't think terrible doesn't mean
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.040]   that if the government overstepped,
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.120]   that it's not important to put that in perspective
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.240]   because the consequences of allowing that to go forward
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.760]   could be much, much worse.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:19.760]   - So there is some encouraging precedent in this.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.960]   There was a case a couple of years ago,
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:24.120]   Riley versus California.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.800]   The court said police must generally have a warrant
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.840]   to search the cell phones of people they arrest.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.240]   Chief Justice Roberts wrote,
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.080]   modern cell phones are not just another technological
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.960]   convenience, even the word cell phone is a misnomer.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.640]   They could just as easily be called cameras,
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.600]   video players, rollodexes, calendars,
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:43.360]   tape records, libraries, diaries, albums,
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.000]   televisions, maps or newspapers.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.280]   So that's good news.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.880]   There's some understanding there
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.320]   of this kind of higher level of information
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.280]   that a cell phone provides.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.320]   There's another case, US versus Jones from 2012.
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.280]   I remember talking about this on security now.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:03.720]   The police attached a GPS tracking device to a suspect's car.
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.640]   They tracked him for 28 days.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.040]   And the court ruled nine to nothing
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.040]   that that was problematic under the Fourth Amendment.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.800]   The majority said the police were not entitled
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.560]   to place the device on private property.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.000]   Five justices who did vote against it,
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.520]   but they voted in saying it was problematic,
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:24.720]   but they said their problem was the government's ability
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.080]   to vacuum up troves of private information.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.200]   So there is some good news that even both the conservative
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.040]   and the liberal wings of the Supreme Court
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.120]   have had some discomfort with this kind of
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.600]   overreaching collection of information.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:44.960]   So cross your fingers, we'll find out in June.
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:47.160]   - I think that it's really important
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:51.520]   that we have new laws passed that kind of set these standards.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:57.000]   We've got to look at what privacy is like in 2017.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.480]   Because so many of the presidents for our law
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:05.480]   were set back when the internet was first being invented.
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.680]   When you look at harassment law,
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:10.680]   this is all based off the Communication Standards
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.000]   and Decency Act, which was when the internet
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.360]   was just a baby.
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:17.520]   So we've got to go through and we've got to have people
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.320]   to understand these issues that can define privacy
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:25.440]   and can give consumers a wider set of rights.
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:28.520]   Because right now we're just at the mercy of Facebook
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.360]   and Google and for the goodwill of a lot of these systems.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.280]   - Somebody in the chat was pointing it out,
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.920]   well, you bought a Samsung TV, Samsung knows what you watched,
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.560]   anybody should have access to that,
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:42.920]   you gave up the right to privacy.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.720]   That's a be another example of the third party.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.520]   - It's another click through agreement though.
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:47.520]   - Yeah, no, no.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:48.520]   - Exactly. - No.
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:49.760]   - Yep. - Nope.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.600]   - Let's take a break.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:52.280]   We'll come back with more and want to talk cars
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:56.320]   and this Elon Musk tweet from yesterday.
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.920]   He's talking about putting his Roadster in space.
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:01.920]   (laughing)
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.000]   I think he was joking.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.440]   - Oh. - Never change Elon,
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.520]   never change. - Never change.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.440]   Don't ever change.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.800]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.440]   First word from ITProTV.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.520]   Love these guys, they've been with us since practically
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:14.080]   the beginning of ITProTV.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.680]   In fact, Tim and Don who founded it were IT trainers
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.400]   who say, and I believe them,
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.400]   that they went to a presentation,
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.600]   I was part of it, NAB, and they got the idea,
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:26.000]   why don't we do what Leo does with Twitch,
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.560]   but do it for IT training, for IT professionals,
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.240]   to help people get the certifications
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:33.160]   they need to get the jobs they want,
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:36.440]   to help people keep those jobs by getting extra skills
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.760]   and polishing up their existing skills.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.960]   And now ITProTV is completely eclipsed us.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:43.880]   They have five studios.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.040]   They make 125 hours of new content every week.
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.280]   Thousands of hours of on-demand content,
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:52.880]   covering every area of IT.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.320]   And you can watch on your computer, on your phone,
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.320]   but you can also watch on your big screen TV,
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.480]   on your Chromecast, on your Roku.
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:03.440]   There's a great ITProTV, Roku channel, FireTV.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.000]   They have an Apple TV app, iOS and Android apps.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.720]   This is a great for an individual who says,
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:13.200]   "I want to be an IT, but I need those certs."
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.480]   Maybe get that certified ethical hacker cert.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:16.320]   I love that.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:19.000]   Learn how to use Cali Linux or Linux security techniques
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.880]   or ITIL, ISC squared security certs.
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.520]   Get the CRIS, the CRIS, the CISSP, the SISM,
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.200]   the SISA, the CEH.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.640]   I love the acronym soup that these certs have.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.560]   You can learn all the skills you need
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.560]   to prepare for the certs you're interested in
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:38.920]   at a very low cost.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:42.360]   And if you manage an IT team, Harvard did this.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:45.640]   Harvard University, they bought ITProTV for the whole team
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.120]   so that they could get new skills
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.080]   and polish the skills they had.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.520]   And with the team solution, you get group pricing,
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.360]   you get access to a supervisor portal.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:57.400]   It lets you control your team's training schedule,
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.440]   create custom groups, training assignments.
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.960]   You can see individual analytics, group analytics,
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:06.040]   view logins, viewing time, view downloads,
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.560]   track course completion, everything you need
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.240]   to keep your team on top of things.
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.240]   Now more than ever, you know, the estimate is
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:18.240]   that there will be one million security jobs open
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:23.880]   this year, 2018, and mostly unfilled.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.680]   These jobs have been hanging around for a couple of years
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:29.720]   now because there just aren't enough IT pros out there
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.800]   with these security skills.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.480]   Get those skills, get that great job at ITProTV.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.440]   Find out how ITProTV can offer you
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.800]   or your team the best IT training solution.

[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.720]   Are they doing anything without a motor cybersecurity yet?
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:19.800]   That's a great question.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.520]   That's got to be a hot topic.
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.480]   I would be surprised.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:24.160]   They're really good on this kind of stuff.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.280]   And yeah, we had a hacker on here.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:32.280]   He was he's chief of security at DEF CON works at,
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:35.000]   what you gonna call it?
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.600]   Gosh, no, it's escaping me.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:39.680]   Anyway, he was on triangulation.
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.320]   He is the guy who act the test, he says running Linux.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.360]   It's running, I can't remember which version of it.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:46.880]   - There's a lot of Linux in vehicles.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.720]   - Sure there is.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:50.600]   But I would think more real-time operating systems.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.440]   - A lot of Q and X.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:52.520]   - Like Q and X.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.600]   - Yeah, most vehicles are running Q and X,
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:58.560]   especially for their infotainment systems.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.560]   But there's also a lot of Linux that's being used
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:04.600]   in the microcontrollers to run the digital instrument clusters.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.440]   - Interesting.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.280]   - Things like that.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:09.040]   - Yeah, when I reboot my big screen, that's a Linux screen.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.040]   - Yeah.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:14.120]   - So Elon on Friday said he's talking about the payload
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.800]   on his rocket to Mars.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.280]   The payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.920]   playing space oddity.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.840]   (laughing)
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:25.680]   - Nice.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.240]   - Control to major Tom destination Mars orbit
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.960]   will be in deep space for a billion years or so
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:33.960]   if it doesn't blow up on a cent.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.640]   Elon says that's a joke.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.200]   - Yeah, well, I mean, unless he shoots it off,
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.480]   you know, out of the solar system,
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.440]   it's not gonna be in deep space for,
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.880]   it's not gonna be out there for a billion years
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:46.040]   because it's gonna fall.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.040]   Mars' gravity is gonna pull it in.
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:49.120]   - He did the next day say,
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.400]   "I love the thought of a car drifting apparently
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:54.280]   "envestly through space, perhaps being discovered
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:57.640]   "by an alien race millions of years in the future."
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:59.280]   But remember, this is the same guy who says
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.880]   we're living in a simulation, so.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.600]   - Yeah, I was gonna say he likes to troll us,
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:04.920]   but I won't whatever he's drinking.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.800]   - Whatever he's having.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:07.720]   - Exactly.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:10.720]   - The Falcon Heavy rocket, that's the one he wants to do.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:12.000]   He's also wants to build.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:12.840]   - Let's watch next month.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:13.680]   - Unly.
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.520]   - Really?
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.360]   - Yeah.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.240]   - He also wants, if they don't go bankrupt between now and then.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:19.600]   - Well, SpaceX is a separate company.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.440]   - Oh, okay, go.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:21.280]   - All right.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.320]   He also wants to build a high speed underground
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.600]   loop in Chicago, the boring company.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:28.080]   This is another tweet.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:28.920]   - Focus, Elon.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:29.760]   Focus.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.360]   (laughing)
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.200]   - Meanwhile, the Gigafactory's got problems
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.120]   with battery production.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:37.720]   The Model 3 is kind of dribbling off the assembly line.
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:39.600]   And what I heard that they're hemorrhaging,
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.520]   Tesla's hemorrhaging a billion dollars.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.840]   - They burned 1.4 billion in the last quarter.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:49.840]   And they're burning, I think about $8 million an hour.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.320]   (laughing)
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.800]   - Wow, it's crazy.
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:54.040]   - But they should.
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.120]   - I'm all in on Tesla.
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:55.960]   I don't care.
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:59.440]   You know, I already put my deposit down for another one.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:01.200]   - I have said this many times.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.600]   I think Elon is, and I've interviewed him a couple times,
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.280]   I think he's an incredible visionary.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.160]   And I think what Tesla has done
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:12.520]   has really inspired the auto industry to move forward.
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:17.520]   Because they really have not done much.
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:21.000]   They were not doing much with lithium ion batteries
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000]   until actually Martin Eberhard and Mark Tarponning's partner
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.040]   really got Tesla going and then they brought in Elon
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.040]   with the funding.
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:33.640]   But it wasn't until that really started to gain some steam
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:36.080]   that the rest of the auto industry
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.160]   really started paying attention.
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:39.280]   And that's when you got cars like the Chevrolet Volt,
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.760]   the first generation Leaf.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.800]   And now, over the next couple of years,
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.880]   we'll get to see a whole slew of long range,
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.960]   affordable EVs coming to market.
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:49.280]   - I almost feel like,
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.160]   while Elon would never admit that,
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.080]   he wouldn't be completely unhappy if that's what happened.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:57.920]   - Well, he has said that he would be fine
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.120]   with everybody, I mean, he's,
[02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:02.400]   I don't know that he actually believes that part of it,
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.400]   but he has said that he would be fine
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.960]   if everybody else would just abandon internal combustion
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:08.680]   and just go all electric.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:13.160]   And he said, he'll make his patents available to anybody to use,
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:14.280]   which is fine.
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:18.000]   And he said, I think I admire Elon's vision.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.040]   And I think he is an incredible visionary.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.440]   What he's not though is a good manager.
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.880]   He's a terrible manager.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.600]   He's terrible at running the company.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:31.600]   And I think he has picked up a lot of Steve Jobs's worst traits
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:36.640]   without the best traits.
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.000]   So he's got the vision,
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.080]   but he doesn't seem to have the self-awareness
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.560]   to realize that he's not the guy
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.320]   to be handling the day-to-day operations.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:50.440]   He wants to retain total control
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.240]   of what's going on at the company.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:55.360]   And what he needs to do is he needs to bring in
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.360]   his own Steve Cook.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.080]   He needs to step aside from the CEO role,
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.040]   be chief visionary officer,
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:05.360]   and get somebody that can actually execute on that vision
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.880]   and make that a reality.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:09.480]   And more importantly, make it a profitable reality
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:11.240]   because if you can't turn a profit,
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.040]   then the company's not gonna survive
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:16.400]   and that vision goes away.
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.880]   - I wanna really agree with what you're saying there
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:20.680]   on two points.
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.520]   Like first, I think you're dead on everyone of my friends
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.480]   that works for Tesla says exactly that.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.880]   That when Elon is focusing on your division
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.120]   when he's thinking about your problem,
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.400]   like money is coming,
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:35.160]   leadership is coming, problems get solved.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:40.120]   When you're not, things get lost in limbo forever,
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.680]   which is why we've seen very slow iteration
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.160]   on some of Tesla's features.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.080]   I think the other thing I would say is,
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:50.160]   a lot of the time when we talk about EV technology,
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:54.320]   we talk about all respect these more boring,
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.160]   environmentally friendly cars.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:00.120]   And I think what the average consumer doesn't know
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.500]   is just how much EV technology is critical
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.320]   in supercars these days.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:09.240]   Like the Acura NSX just came out.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:10.920]   It has a combustion engine.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.360]   And that also has amazing car, a freaky amazing car.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:18.600]   But it also has this EV engine built inside of it,
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:20.000]   which is why I can get to the,
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.960]   what's the zero to 61.9 is just ridiculous.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.560]   - Well, no, that's the new roadster.
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.560]   - That's the roadster.
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.520]   - The NSX is about three seconds.
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:29.960]   - Yeah, but it's still,
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:33.360]   - I ran a quarter mile in an NSX at 11.3 seconds
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.000]   and a hundred and 22 miles an hour.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:35.920]   - Oh, geez.
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.840]   - I mean, it's phenomenal.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.000]   - Wow.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.920]   So yeah, I mean, and you start talking about motorcycle,
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:44.320]   some of the most exciting things have happened
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.880]   in motorcycles in a long time,
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:48.080]   or the same technology.
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.600]   Batteries, 'cause you can go zero to 60.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.760]   If you can go that fast in a Tesla,
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:54.280]   and that's how much faster you can go
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:58.080]   in something, it just tests two wheels in that little engine.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.640]   This is, it's really exciting
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.360]   for like the future of a motor sport.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:03.200]   - Yeah.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.200]   So I feel like winter lose, succeed or fail.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.120]   Tesla jump started something.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:10.960]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.280]   - And really, if it's gonna fail,
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.760]   it fails because GM and everybody on Ford,
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.360]   just says, "Oh," and Audi folks wagon says,
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.200]   "Oh."
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.920]   - Or, "We should be making these," right?
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.320]   - Or because it's hard to make a mass market car.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.640]   I mean, you know, I don't have any experience.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.920]   I think it's my wife said,
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:33.160]   "I want a company that knows how to bend steel."
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.000]   - Yeah.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.480]   - You know, these companies have been making cars
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.480]   for a hundred years and know a little bit,
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:40.480]   I think about making cars.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.800]   - Yeah, it's an incredibly complex process.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:47.240]   You know, it's a ballet of all these thousands of pieces
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:49.160]   that have to show up at the assembly line
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.640]   at just the right time, at the right position
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:54.480]   and have the people there with the right tools
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:55.480]   to put it all together.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.640]   - He has solved these logistic issues though
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:59.800]   with the Model S and now with the Model X.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:01.320]   He's having problems with the Model 3.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.880]   - Not from what we've heard of, you know,
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.880]   what, I mean, from the reports we've heard
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:07.560]   from people who have actually toured the Fremont factory.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.200]   You know, we hear reports, you know,
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.760]   racks and racks of parts, you know, everywhere.
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:15.760]   It's like, no, that's not the way you build a--
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:16.600]   - It's supposed to be just in time.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:19.640]   - Yeah, you don't want huge quantities of inventory
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:21.480]   sitting there doing nothing.
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:23.760]   You know, everything needs to be made
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.480]   and just delivered at just the right time
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.280]   and put together in the right sequence, you know,
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:32.320]   in the right combination so you don't have
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.360]   four different colored seats in the car.
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:35.600]   - Can we trust GM though?
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:38.400]   - Well GM killed the EV one, they killed the electric car.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:41.160]   - Can we trust them now to make electric cars
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.520]   and not kill them?
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.680]   - Well now it's their savior.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:45.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.640]   - I mean, you know, like, like, killed it before
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:50.120]   because the gas industry and, you know,
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.400]   and combustion engines was the bread and butter.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:54.080]   I mean, things have changed.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.760]   They also have, I mean, I think it's important to note too
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.600]   that the CEO, the board of directors,
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.800]   the entire company is very different now than it was.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.960]   - Yeah, it's a very different company today.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:07.680]   And, you know, the reasoning behind the end of the EV one,
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:12.440]   I mean, the EV one was a unique one-off product at GM
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.080]   and all the parts in it were completely bespoke.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:17.440]   You know, there was, they didn't use any off the shelf parts
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.880]   from other vehicles.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.680]   And, you know, legally, you know, for liability reasons,
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:26.800]   they had to, they had to support that vehicle
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:28.040]   for an extended period of time.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.680]   It would have been incredibly costly to do that.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:34.240]   And certainly, I think from the way they communicated it all
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.920]   of it, they did that very poorly.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:39.480]   But, you know, if they had done that better
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.720]   and gone directly from that into, you know,
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:45.520]   and already been working on a new EV program,
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.400]   then, you know, you never would have had this issue.
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.200]   But, unfortunately, they did drop the ball there.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.680]   And, you know, because the technology
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.160]   was not commercially viable.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:56.560]   And, you know, for the same reasons, you know,
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.200]   that, you know, why Tesla may or may not actually survive,
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:04.240]   you know, if they had focused too much at that time on EVs,
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.000]   then they would have been in trouble
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.320]   with Wall Street as well.
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.440]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:09.280]   Yeah.
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.520]   - All right.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:14.600]   So, I'm still rooting for you on.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.040]   - Yeah, well, I think, you know, what's that?
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:18.720]   What's the thing that can root for?
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:19.720]   - I think it doesn't mean anything to me.
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:20.920]   - I think it's actually like putting my money
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.680]   where my mouth is after all, right?
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:24.520]   - The thing that's actually likely to make EVs
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.320]   really commercially viable is actually autonomy.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.640]   - Yeah.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.720]   - Driving automation.
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.200]   Because, you know, EVs are still more expensive.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.960]   I mean, the cost has come down, but they are still more expensive.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.640]   And for the way most average people drive their vehicles,
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.400]   the payback time with the lower operating costs of an EV
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.800]   stretch out so long that they can't wrap their heads around it.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:51.200]   But for fleet operations, for autonomous mobility services,
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.880]   now, you know, the operating cost is much more important.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.080]   You've got vehicles instead of them being driven
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.720]   10 or 15,000 miles a year.
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:00.920]   They're running 100,000 miles a year.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.320]   And automated vehicles need the electricity,
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.720]   need the electrical power to drive everything.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:11.800]   I was with GM last week and they showed us their autonomous
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:13.760]   bolt that Cruz is working on.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:16.880]   And the first prototypes that were just the autonomous system
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:19.600]   was drawing three to four kilowatts of power.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:22.720]   So, you know, 10 hours of use, that thing's going to draw
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:25.240]   down half the battery without even moving.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.080]   - Yeah.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.080]   - So, you know, I think autonomous mobility can really be
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.200]   the thing that gets many, many EVs on the road and gets people
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.600]   using them and really starts to get critical mass.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:39.200]   - I also think there's another story we didn't get to get
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.760]   about Samsung and they finally managed to get a commercial
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:45.800]   application of graphene in their batteries to make it
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.320]   charge that much more quickly.
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:52.720]   You know, for a lot of biotech companies around Boston,
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.760]   you can go there and you see they've, you know,
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:58.360]   installed juice bar where you can like charge your car.
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.840]   I think once graphene in this new battery technology
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.440]   starts making its way into electric vehicles,
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.240]   when you have something about that, you know,
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.760]   super capacitive and super conductive,
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:11.640]   that means like this range problem is obviated
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:14.240]   because you can fill up in electric vehicles quickly,
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:16.360]   you can fill up a combustion engine.
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.920]   So, I think those two technologies together
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:22.000]   are really can guess on the right track.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.720]   - Still, there's still the issue though of actually being
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:26.640]   able to mass produce those graphene batteries.
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.480]   - Yep, huge.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.560]   - There's been a lot of very interesting breakthroughs
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.040]   in batteries over the last 10 or 15 years,
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.160]   none of which have, they've managed to actually
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.840]   figure out ways to mass produce it.
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:38.640]   And if Samsung can do that, I mean, Samsung actually does
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:40.760]   some very good battery technology if they can do that
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.720]   with these graphene batteries.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.040]   Well, besides that-- - You see, you don't think
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.680]   of Samsung in good battery technology.
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:47.040]   - But did you, did you take off?
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:48.880]   - It's a big battery. - That's the big battery.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.760]   - Yeah. - That enormous battery
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:53.800]   plant that Tesla just assembled in South Australia,
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:56.840]   that they just launched last week or the week before,
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:58.400]   that's actually using Samsung cells.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.080]   It's not-- - Oh, it's not Panasonic anymore.
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.640]   - Oh, interesting. - Because Panasonic
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:03.880]   couldn't supply the cells that they needed for that thing.
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:07.360]   So Samsung, they launched a Samsung for the cells for that.
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:10.880]   - Final story, net neutrality.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:11.920]   We haven't said anything about it,
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:13.000]   I guess we probably should.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.360]   The good news is we now know who's to blame
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:20.600]   for all of the, all of the agita around,
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.960]   agit pies decision to dump net neutrality.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.920]   It's shares fault.
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.160]   - Yeah, Twitter's fault. - Twitter.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:29.400]   - Twitter is shares fault. - Twitter.
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:31.280]   - Melissa Milano, yeah. - Yeah.
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:33.640]   - Well, actually I think it's actually pretty reasonable
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.800]   to blame Twitter, given their role in promoting
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:38.560]   certain candidates in the election.
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:41.040]   - Yeah, but the big-- - That's not what agit pie
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.440]   is saying by the way. - But if that candidate
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:45.160]   had not been using Twitter in that way,
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:46.680]   he might not have gotten elected.
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:49.440]   - What Pie is saying is that the tech giants
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.560]   are the ones that are a threat to net neutrality,
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:55.720]   not the ISPs and the kids. - And she's not angry
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.480]   about Twitter promoting certain candidates.
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.280]   He's angry that the Twitter bans Nazis sometimes.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.360]   That that's what he's angry about is that people
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:09.960]   who are conservative apparently are treated poorly.
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:11.760]   That's his argument against Twitter,
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.440]   not the Russian-- - She says, "Now look,
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:15.680]   "I love Twitter, but let's not kid ourselves.
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:17.400]   "When it comes to a free and open internet,
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.760]   "Twitter is part of the problem.
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:22.200]   "The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.800]   "to discriminate.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:25.880]   "Unfortunately, Twitter is not an outlier."
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.520]   And by the way, he's speaking to a friendly audience here
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:30.640]   'cause if he were speaking to anybody else,
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:32.800]   they'd go, "What the hell are you talking about?"
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:34.840]   Indeed, despite all the talk and all the fear
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.320]   that broadband providers could decide
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.280]   what internet content consumers can see,
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:41.600]   recent experience shows, it's the edge providers
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:43.760]   that are deciding what content they see.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.480]   - Oh, hi. - These providers routinely
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:48.120]   block or discriminate against content they don't like,
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.680]   here's the fear I have.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.800]   This is the first shot in the, now we know
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:56.800]   what the position is gonna be from people
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.560]   who are really carrying water for Comcast,
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.520]   for Ryzen, the big companies.
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:04.680]   Because that's what Comcast and Verizon would like you,
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:08.400]   the voter to think, is, "Oh no, it's not us.
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.920]   "We're just nice people bringing you the internet."
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.840]   It's those people at Google and Twitter,
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:16.040]   they're the problems-- - They're the problem.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:17.760]   Facebook, it's all their fault.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.160]   It's not that Comcast refused,
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.640]   wouldn't let people use BitTorrent in 2000.
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.920]   - Not an AT&T blocked FaceTime,
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.840]   that's nothing to do with us.
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:33.160]   No, this is-- - There's no way
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.840]   that Comcast is going to give higher priority
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.840]   to NBC Universal content versus 21st Century Fox content.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.920]   - AT&T would never block Skype.
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:45.760]   - Comcast would never say, "Oh, well,
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:47.440]   "as long as you're accessing our apps
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.640]   "and our tools that won't count against your data cap."
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:54.080]   Oh wait, they already do that, even now, yeah.
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.880]   - So I think that what this is,
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:58.480]   this is basically,
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:02.040]   AgitPy has now outlined the government's position
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:05.440]   about all this, that those evil folks at Twitter
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.080]   and people like Sharon, Alyssa Milano, the liberal elite,
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.440]   that's what they're saying, it's dog whistles, it's code word,
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:16.920]   the liberal elite is really the problem in this country
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:19.520]   and that the ISPs are all about free speech.
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.840]   - The ISPs are all about free speech,
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:24.560]   you know, as long as you can pay for it.
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:26.160]   - Pay for it, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:28.960]   You know, I'm not gonna say anything about net neutrality
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.520]   because this is a family show
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:32.400]   and I don't want to use the language.
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:34.240]   - Are you a little upset about that there?
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.040]   - I'm pretty upset about it, I'm pretty upset,
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:37.720]   but I will say this,
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:41.840]   I know Al Franken is somebody that hasn't had the best month,
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:45.200]   but he had, in his last book, he had a chapter,
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.040]   it was very, very relevant to this,
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:52.040]   where he talked about when Comcast went through their last,
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.440]   you know, acquisition and they went before his committee
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:57.920]   and they tried to, you know,
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:00.840]   they were trying to get basically anti-trust permission
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:04.080]   to move forward and he talked about how he fought
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:09.080]   to force clauses in there where Comcast would have to
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:14.160]   basically give internet access to lower income people
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.600]   and they absolutely, they went before Congress,
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:18.960]   they said what they'd have to say
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.840]   and they completely lied about it,
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:23.720]   just didn't follow through at all.
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:26.440]   So I think like you've really got to look
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.920]   at these companies history when it comes to regulation,
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.560]   like they're PR people saying, we're gonna do A, B and C,
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:37.800]   it doesn't, it's not legally binding, you know,
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:39.560]   there's no reason to believe that.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.560]   Companies are gonna do what is in their best interest.
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:46.840]   - Of course, interesting article,
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:50.680]   which was unfortunately titled by Ben Thompson in Stratecary,
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:53.600]   his original title, Why Adjut Pai is Right,
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:57.800]   and really wasn't, I hope, what he meant to say,
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:01.840]   what he is saying, I think, and it's as usual with Ben,
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:06.680]   it's a lot of very erudite writing,
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:11.680]   but what I think he is saying is maybe title two regulation,
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:14.840]   he says I'm for net neutrality,
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.000]   I believe-- - He's not for title two--
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.400]   - Fostering innovation, I think the net neutrality
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.200]   is the only way the internet can function at scale
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.520]   and innovation is how we survive
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:24.160]   the internet driven transformation,
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:28.720]   that's only just beginning, but he says title two regulation
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:32.200]   is not the way to do it.
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:33.680]   - I just, I mean, I love Ben,
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.040]   and I think he's incredibly smart,
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.760]   I do disagree with him on that point.
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:39.280]   I mean, I think he wrote a compelling
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:42.480]   and an argument that could sway a lot of people,
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:44.480]   I personally disagree with it.
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.680]   - I can't disagree with the idea
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:48.280]   that the government should execute a light touch
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:49.800]   and what we really need is competition,
[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:52.600]   the problem is what we don't have is competition.
[02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:54.040]   - Well, this is the whole point,
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:55.240]   is that we don't have competition,
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.560]   we haven't ever had competition,
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:58.640]   and there's nothing being done to increase that.
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:00.440]   And in fact, when those things do happen,
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:03.400]   you see companies, I mean, even in the case of Google Fiber,
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:05.320]   when they were attempting to come into different places,
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.600]   now obviously Google has backed off of that plan,
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:12.120]   you would see the behavior on behalf of Comcast and Verizon
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:14.120]   in those areas, you know, to do everything they could
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.360]   to stymie Google from getting, from even starting there.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:20.720]   So we, I would be with you,
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:22.800]   light touch would be great, assuming we had competition,
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:26.200]   but we don't, and in fact, most people don't even have a choice
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:27.840]   between, on who their ISP is,
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:28.840]   it depends on where you live,
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.360]   and you probably have one choice.
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:33.320]   If you're lucky, you have to, if you're lucky, have to.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.000]   - And I would submit, I don't know why Ben
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.880]   isn't mentioning this, but that this,
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:40.440]   that what actually Ajit Pai has done is the antithesis
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:42.600]   of light touch and encouraging competition,
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:46.160]   because he's banned the states from,
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:49.360]   from in any way interfering with net neutrality,
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:53.880]   and he's allowed to go forward the efforts by ISPs
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.760]   to prohibit public broadband, municipal broadband.
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:57.880]   - Exactly, I was going to say,
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:00.000]   because that's where competition could happen.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.200]   - Right. - And the FCC
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.280]   and the ISPs are shutting it down.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.000]   - Yup.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.200]   - Now, let me say another thing that's gonna,
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:10.280]   I'll take all the arrows now.
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:15.120]   I'm not sure, I'm not sure that I,
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:18.680]   that we need to worry about Comcast and Verizon.
[02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:21.520]   I know we've seen bad behavior from them in the past,
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:24.320]   but I think all eyes are upon them,
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.200]   and I think that they are going,
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:27.200]   one thing we know for sure,
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.520]   they're gonna act in their best financial interest.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.160]   That's how these companies are constructed,
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.320]   that's what they should do,
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:34.160]   their capitalist enterprises.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:38.600]   And because I think they would get so much heat
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:41.920]   if they were to throttle Netflix again,
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.200]   that that may not be a real threat,
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:46.320]   in at least in the months to come.
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:47.960]   Do you think? - Maybe, maybe not originally,
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:51.200]   but again, okay, so they get blowback.
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.240]   But what is your choice as a consumer?
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:56.000]   Okay, so it's because if Comcast is the only person
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.720]   I can get as my ISP,
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.040]   and they decide to throttle Netflix
[02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:01.840]   unless I pay them an extra $10 a month,
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:03.040]   I don't have any recourse.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:04.600]   I can't go to another ISP.
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.360]   I still have to do that.
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:08.640]   And I think that, but I'm with you,
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:11.440]   I think optically they might refrain from doing that instead,
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:13.040]   but I think they'll probably going to do.
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:14.920]   And I think in some ways this is more insidious,
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:16.920]   and we've already seen this happening,
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:18.040]   with wireless companies,
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:20.800]   which already weren't being held
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:23.000]   to the same net neutrality standards
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.080]   as traditional ISPs,
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:26.760]   is an increase in zero rating,
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:28.800]   and zero rating on its face
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:30.800]   can be very good for consumers by saying, oh.
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:32.440]   - Soers won't complain about that, yeah.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:33.280]   - Soers won't complain about it,
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:34.840]   'cause I'm getting this for free,
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.480]   or I'm getting this more stuff.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:38.320]   But that to me is actually more insidious
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:39.960]   because it is giving preferential treatment
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:40.840]   to certain services,
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.480]   and it is giving certain places an advantage
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.760]   and a lack of because of their business relationship,
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:46.880]   or because of something else.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.840]   - What if we, instead of putting pressure on AgitPy
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:52.160]   to not, by the way, they haven't voted yet,
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:55.440]   December 14th, not to preserve net neutrality,
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.880]   but instead put strong pressure on the FCC
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:01.800]   and Congress to foster competition,
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.680]   to make rules, instead of make rules that are anti-competitive,
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:06.560]   make rules that are pro-competition
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:08.400]   that encourage small ISPs,
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.560]   'cause if there is an alternative
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.920]   and companies behave badly,
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:15.120]   consumers will move to the alternative.
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.320]   - Well, in theory, that's great,
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:19.080]   except that there is no alternative today.
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.080]   - But that's why they need the government
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:22.880]   and the Congress we have made.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.200]   - The Congress we have today isn't gonna do anything at all.
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:25.360]   - No, it has to be quite like that.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:26.240]   - It's pretty clear that they don't care
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:27.600]   what anybody thinks.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:31.360]   - Yeah, at least not the majority of the people.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.560]   - I mean, what is net neutrality competition?
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:36.320]   - I do think you're dead on the Leo.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:39.440]   Like the answer here is we've got to roll back
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.080]   these huge mega mergers.
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:46.080]   So we have basically two, essentially ISPs
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:47.640]   throughout the whole country.
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:49.760]   Like we've gotta roll that back.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:53.560]   I also think rather than leaving this up for the FCC
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:56.680]   to interpret, I think it would be much better
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:01.080]   if Congress would just pass a bill, ensuring this.
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:02.800]   I think that's the way to do this.
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:04.640]   - Well, that's your job, Brianna Wu.
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:07.880]   When you get into Congress in 2018,
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:10.600]   you're gonna step up there and you're gonna say,
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:13.360]   the, I think we'll make up a nice acronym for it,
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.920]   but the act to foster competition
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:19.480]   among internet service providers,
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:21.840]   and we're gonna get that bill passed,
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.360]   and it's gonna be something everybody can get behind.
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.040]   And that is better than anything.
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:28.600]   Let's not have government regulation,
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:30.600]   let's foster competition.
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:32.480]   And if true competition were out there,
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:34.920]   then I wouldn't really be worried.
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.560]   - You know, increasingly, as I see what's been happening
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.720]   over the last several years, you know,
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:43.960]   I'm more and more inclined to like the idea
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:47.040]   of setting an expiry date for corporations.
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:48.160]   - I love that idea.
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:49.600]   - What?
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:50.440]   - 25 years.
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.280]   - I love this idea, that's it.
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:52.760]   - Then you liquidate, and you move on.
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:54.400]   - Start over again, see you later.
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.560]   'Cause frankly, let's face it, Facebook, Google, Amazon,
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:01.200]   these companies really like,
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.920]   they would love to get rid of net neutrality.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:06.440]   That is true, because they are incumbents.
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:10.520]   It's the companies in power that will stay in power.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:14.680]   It's the little small, innovative competitors
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:16.000]   that are gonna be disadvantaged
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.280]   if we throw out net neutrality.
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.240]   And so truthfully, I don't think Google's
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:21.120]   fighting the fight for net neutrality.
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.240]   - First they're not, I mean, 'cause, yeah, it'd be.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:25.160]   - Yeah.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.360]   - So we gotta figure out, you know what,
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:27.680]   this is all comes down to,
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:29.560]   we gotta get money out of politics,
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:31.640]   we gotta get people who understand technology,
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.680]   understand these issues into Congress,
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:36.360]   and that means each and every one of us
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:39.000]   has a job to do over the next 18 months,
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.120]   a big job to do.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.280]   Job one, if you're in the Massachusetts eighth,
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.920]   let's get, sign that petition
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.280]   when Brianna comes knocking at your door,
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:47.880]   let's get her on the ballot,
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.480]   let's get her into Congress.
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:51.000]   It'd be nice to have some leadership on this.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.120]   Brianna Wu is co-founder of Giant Spacecat,
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:56.360]   she's Spacecat gal on the Twitter,
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:58.200]   and she of course is running for Congress
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:01.120]   in the Massachusetts eighth, Brianna Wu 2018.com
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.280]   if you wanna find out more.
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.480]   And she and her colleague to her left,
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.080]   Christina Warren, along with Simone de Roche for,
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:14.760]   are on the fabulous Rocket podcast,
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:17.440]   which Sam says he listens to religious.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.280]   - Every week.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.120]   - I'll forgive him.
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:19.960]   - Yay!
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:20.800]   Thank you Sam.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:22.200]   - You should come on as a host sometime.
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:23.040]   We'll have you over the afternoon.
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.400]   - Yeah, we'd love to have you.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.760]   Relay.fm if you wanna know more.
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:32.520]   Christina is at Microsoft where you could find her
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:35.440]   working hard at Channel 9,
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:38.840]   and she is Senior Cloud Developer Advocate there,
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:42.120]   and she's still at the Twitter @film_girl.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:43.640]   And do you, I didn't ask you,
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:46.080]   but do you have other podcasts you wanna plug, Christina?
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.440]   - No, Rock is the main one.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.920]   I also do a show called Over Tired,
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:51.200]   but it hasn't been regularly done in a while.
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:52.120]   - You're tired to do it.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:52.960]   I know, I understand.
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.640]   - It's really good though, with Brad Terpstra.
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:55.480]   I love that one, man.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:56.320]   - I love Brad.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.720]   I mean, rare occasions when it comes out, but yeah.
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:01.360]   - I love that you listen to it.
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:02.320]   That's amazing.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:04.440]   No, we were supposed to record an episode this morning,
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:06.480]   and I like totally bales, so we're gonna record it.
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:07.920]   - I'm just kidding.
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:10.120]   - Okay, I think the name is the problem.
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:10.960]   I'm just saying.
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:14.720]   You're living up to the name of Over Tired.
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.800]   - Yeah, that's true, this is true.
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:19.560]   - Maybe you need a nude podcast name like Energized.
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:25.040]   And Sam Abul Masamid is also a podcaster.
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:26.520]   His show is--
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:28.680]   - Wheel bearings at wheelbarings.media.
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:30.240]   - I don't know why I blank that out.
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:32.920]   Wheel bearings, and it's all about cars.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:34.720]   - It's all about cars and transportation
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:37.640]   and automotive technology, and kind of where things are,
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.400]   are and where it's going in the future.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:40.760]   - Oh, it's a must listen to.
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:42.760]   And of course, Sam works at Navigant
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:44.200]   where he's a senior analyst,
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:46.960]   and covers automotive stories at Forbes,
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:48.320]   and other places in fact.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.440]   - Forbes, and I have a column
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:51.080]   in Automotive Engineering magazine.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.120]   - Nice.
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:54.320]   - And he's gonna be on this new screen savers
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:56.640]   next week talking about electric cars
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:00.280]   as we test drive the new Nissan Leaf.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:03.640]   - Leaf, the new 2018 electric vehicle.
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:06.000]   That's fun, we did that right before the show.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.640]   - Everybody, thank you so much for being here.
[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:09.080]   I think I'm gonna guess I'm betting
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:10.920]   if you're still listening, you're glad you were here.
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:13.300]   This was a great conversation, a great panel.
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:16.120]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m.

[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:25.200]   But don't we leave it all in.
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.240]   Why not?
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:29.600]   How else do you get a two and a half hour podcast, right?
