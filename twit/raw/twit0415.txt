[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.560]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.760]   to show the covers of the week's Tech News.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.280]   We've got a wonderful and well-fed studio audience
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.440]   here, thanks to Jolio Dell, who has once again
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.600]   brought cupcakes.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.360]   These look very unusually beautiful.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.480]   They're muffins, sir.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.640]   They're cinnamon coffee cake muffins.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.760]   What is the difference between--
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080]   I think we talked about this last time.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.560]   The difference between a cupcake and a muffin.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   Well, that you can just--
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   How easily he's distracted.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   Muffins are technology.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   Delicious technology.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   Oh, hey, that's Mr. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   also joining us.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   The poor guy is from-- everybody else is in studio,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   and poor Dwight is on Skype, so he doesn't get any cupcakes.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   I'm so sorry.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   My wife has got chocolate chip pecan oatmeal cookies
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   downstairs.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   Oh, I'm so sorry for you at all, my friend.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   And allegedly, there'll be crawfish ravioli when I get down
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   there.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   Holy moly!
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   She's an awesome cook.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   She's an incredible cook.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   Houston the land of frost.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Y'all are invited.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   Y'all are invited anytime.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   All right, let's all fly down to the Gulf.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   Hello.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   With a vintage laptop.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Yeah, they've set me up with this crazy thing.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   That is Data Mansor's steampunk laptop.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   It's a wooden case.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   It's actually an Asus Windows 7 laptop, but it's got a wood case.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   Leather wrist guards.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   Handcracks.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   I have to keep cranking that thing every so often.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   Everyone's having a sad time.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   Everyone's having a sad time.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   Turn it on.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   Good to have you, John, from channeldevorak.com.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   And some of you, we haven't seen in a long time, but who has gained
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   some notoriety this week.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   Mr. Kevin Rose.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   Hello.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   Google Ventures.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   I don't know if I wanted to have this notoriety.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   Our timing couldn't have been better.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   We booked you before.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   Yeah, like four weeks ago or something like that.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   So don't think that we're capitalizing on the incident.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   And don't think that Leo put that raccoon there.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   He's part of an harassment policy.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   He planted that.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   So almost a million views now on the YouTube video that you posted
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   just what yesterday?
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   Yeah, yesterday.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   That's going to pass up my Barney for sure.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   I would show this video, but I'm afraid of getting, you know,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   when we show YouTube videos, sometimes we get pulled down.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   So we thought we'd reenact it.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   Right?
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   Can we do a raccoon in the house?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   Don't throw it down.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   There's a stairwell.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   I'm just going to show you what Kevin did.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   I have to get up to this.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   This is amazing.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   I had no idea this was happening.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   Is my dog at the bottom of the stairs?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   All right.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   Okay.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   So we're going to reenact it.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   So Leo says there's a live raccoon down there.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   He's taking on Leo.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   That would be amazing.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   He's going down.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   I have a little bit of the raccoon came and did an interview with you.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   Like all 10.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.560]   There is a Twitter account for the raccoon now, apparently.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   Right.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   Of course there is.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   Oh, it looks like there we go.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   Did you scream like a girl when you did it?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   I didn't scream like that.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   No.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   It's a Leo original there.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   There's no raccoon.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   He could just show.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, that's show business.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   This is my great radio.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   And now he's looking at the studio.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   He's locked out.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   He's locked in the bed.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560]   Okay.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.560]   Kevin, you're going to be the host today.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   This had been planned for about 15 minutes.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   Do we introduce Joliet?
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   Oh, no.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560]   Here he comes.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   There he is.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   [applause]
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   Why can't you show videos on the show?
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   No, I can't.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   I was going to say.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   Unfortunately, my dog was here.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   We should have borrowed yours.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   What did you throw down the stairs?
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   That was a raccoon.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   Bring me the raccoon.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   He keeps a dead raccoon in the place.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   So what happened?
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   You let toaster out?
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   Yeah, so we had gone out for dinner.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Let's start.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   Let's start at the beginning.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   Why did you name the dog toaster?
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   Have you not seen Battlestar Galactica?
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   He named it after the Instagram filter.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   No.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   Toasters are the evil, like--
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   You're talking about the sign name for a call.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   Oh, it's the second iteration of the show.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.560]   I hate it.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   I watched one episode and I wrote it in the last year's game.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   Does his light go up and down in Spine?
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   Why did you--
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   No, he does not have that.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   I know he named toaster after a sign loss.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   Yeah, Jarya came up with the name and--
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   That's just terrible.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   We thought it was awesome.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   He looks like burnt toast when he--
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   It's much more cuddly than a silon.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   He's like a little cute little cuddly curly dog.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   Did he get bit?
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   He got hit in the arse.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   Wait, pause that there.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   Well, he's the one who's there.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   Pause that there.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   Go back here.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   So you let him out of the house to pee.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   Yeah, it's like 1 a.m.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   We're getting ready to go to bed.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   You know, we got home from a late dinner.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   Pause it.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.560]   And you know, you let the dog out and he always barks a couple of times when he goes down because it's like he's kind of scared.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   Well, we've had raccoons in the house before.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   No, Ozzy does that too.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   He's kind of clearing the way.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   Clear in the way.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   And so I hear a couple of barks and then I hear that kind of like--
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   Ooh, he's a--
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   Yeah, like--
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   Exactly.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   Pretty much.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   Pretty much.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   It was just chaos.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   It was like clearly something went wrong.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   Scrabble, Scrabble, Scrabble, or whatever.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   And he's yelping at that point.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   Like he's like really getting hurt.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   So show the video.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   So daddy did the rescue because you just--
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   Well, I ran down the stairs because I was like, what the hell's going on?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   I see a raccoon there.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   But that way of a pause it again.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   Normal reaction to this point is to get a stick, a bag, or start kicking.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.560]   No, that's adrenaline.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   That's hurting his pup dog.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   Well, at this point at the very-- if you look at back at the video, at the very in there,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   he had actually flipped over and he was on top of toaster.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   And toaster was on his bag.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   And he was clawing at his eyes and like trying to like basically kill him.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   So fight or flight here?
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   Yeah, so I mean--
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   He decided to fight.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   I would have run.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   Worst case, the thing is going to like bite you or claw at you.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   Wow, that could be a bad case.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   I mean, it's going to hurt, but you know that you're strong enough to like--
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   You know, deal with the animal.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   Show the rest of it.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   I'm sure you've got complaints from PETA already, because he actually picks up--
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.560]   Oh my gosh!
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   Holy--
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   Wait a minute, pause it again.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   Well, there's a better camera view.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   You picked it up.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   Yes, I grabbed it by its back and just picked it up and pulled off of toaster.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   You picked it up.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   Yes, I grabbed it by its back.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   Are you watching the show?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   No, I'm trying to get into the chat room, but I can't figure out how to turn the volume down
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   on this crazy thing.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   Sometimes you laptop it lags a little.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   We're going to wait while John watches what just happened.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.560]   Let's see here.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   There's a thing that--
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   That's what I'm watching.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   That's what it looks like being on Skype, isn't it?
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   He just wants to be with you, Joey.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   Usually.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Usually doesn't have the sound turned up to the max.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   That's true.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   That's true.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   There are other ways.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   We'll help you get in the chat room next time.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   Anyway, so, was it heavy?
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   It was about 25 pounds or so, and it felt very--
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   But it felt very--
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   It felt very--
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   You're in good shape.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   I'm in good shape.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   It felt very greasy.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   It's not that heavy.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   It's all got a bunch of garbage.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   Garbage, oh.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   Garbage is not--
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   Oh, Rick's ones are clean.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   They watched their food before they eat it.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   With pee.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   Yeah, it was--
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   Right.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.560]   So continue with the video.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   So, this is a--
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   Wait a minute, pause it.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   This is security camera.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Yeah, we have cameras around the house, obviously, to guard against weird things.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   So this is good.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   You recorded your own hard drive, so you had action.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   It just goes to cloud instantly.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   Oh.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   It's like drop camera or something.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   Yeah, it's similar to that.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   Okay.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   All right.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   So finish the video.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Yeah, it's motion--
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   Because the other angle is good.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.560]   Yeah, and then I have another camera that gets together and gets together and gets together
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   and gets together and gets together and gets together and gets together and gets together
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   and gets together and gets together and gets together and gets together and gets together

[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.060]   and gets together and gets together and gets together
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.060]   and gets together
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.060]   and gets together
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.060]   and gets together
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.060]   and gets together and gets together
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.060]   and gets together
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.060]   and gets together
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.060]   and gets together
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.060]   and gets together
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.060]   and gets together
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.060]   There's so desperate in Hollywood
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.060]   Still cabinet
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.060]   You say you have video of it in the cloud
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.060]   Were you able to go back
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.060]   and see the initial encounter between your
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.060]   dog and the raccoon?
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.060]   No, that was the first because the second it detects motion
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.060]   it takes like a second or two for a start recording
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   The first thing you see is the first that I saw
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   So what we don't know and we'll never know
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.060]   Who started the fight?
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.060]   Yeah, yeah
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   You don't know
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   Doesn't make any of you shouldn't be raccoons on your steps
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.060]   Do you have doggy stand your ground laws
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.060]   and uh
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   Yeah, it's uh
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.060]   It's a scary scary thing more than anything else actually
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.060]   Yeah, yeah, I just think it's interesting
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   and it's telling that
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.060]   your first reaction, I think this is
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.060]   postive of this generation is
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.060]   Oh, I better tweet that
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.060]   Post it, post it
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   It's the first reaction and Dari had said
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.060]   Yeah, post it. I was thinking
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.060]   when I told Dari, I went up back up the stairs
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.060]   and I was like I just tossed a raccoon in the air
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.060]   She's like what?
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.060]   I understand, you're full of crap
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.060]   Yeah, it sounds like something
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.060]   and then when I had the video footage
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   it's like you gotta show your friends that stuff
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.060]   This is crazy
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.060]   So now almost 900,000 friends have watched it
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.060]   You're definitely gonna cross 5 million before the end of the week
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.060]   I mean this is huge
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.060]   You've got the ad deal going on with the
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.060]   YouTube so you can pick up some money
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.060]   Come on, put some ads on there
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.060]   He doesn't even need money, he's a venture capitalist
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   I love that we're quite a few jokes along those lines
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   Like I just showed you my elevator pitch raccoon
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.060]   Stuff like that
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.060]   Oh really?
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.060]   Yeah, it's terrible
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.060]   I know, it's funny
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   Anyway, congratulations on killing that damn record
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.060]   It survived
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.060]   Well, it went off to lick its wounds
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.060]   We don't know, I think you're probably right
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.060]   Recoons are resilient, right?
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.060]   It seemed like it bounced kind of
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.060]   It was more of a bounce
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   Well, you know how like they're furry
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.060]   and they're like little balls or
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   Yeah, I think it just bounced
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   And claws and teeth
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   And claws?
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.060]   Well, there you go, that's the tech
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.060]   That's the big tech story of the week
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.060]   You know that he has a Twitter account
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   He does, he was tweeting at me and I've heard of it
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.060]   No, somebody, there's multiple Twitter accounts
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.060]   Oh, that's our raccoon
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.060]   So now, but there's another one
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.060]   There's another raccoon that's raccoon
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.060]   Tossed raccoon
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.060]   You mean there's more than one?
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.060]   Yeah, there's a few of them that's throwing out
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   Boy, Twitter
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   Some people, there were a few people that were pissed
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.060]   They were like, why don't you throw it?
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.060]   You should have like, you know
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.060]   Even on the Reddit, by the way, the way this took off
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.060]   Was on Reddit, it became huge
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.060]   It was a hole, it's getting so...
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   Yeah, I made the top of Reddit
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   I think anybody who lives in an urban area
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.060]   knows that raccoons are a problem
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.060]   But on the other hand, we did move into their territory
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.060]   Yeah, they look so cute too
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.060]   And you like see them actually?
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.060]   People feed them at parks
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.060]   By the way, you're the number one
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.060]   Search result for raccoon on Twitter
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.060]   And for misspelled raccoon too
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.060]   There you go, that's internet fame
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.060]   Yeah, if Zuck had chucked a raccoon
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.060]   it would have been an international scandal
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.060]   Says, uh, drew all enough
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.060]   Jason Calicanis says
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.060]   There's no such thing as an association against raccoon cruelty
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   As he said, they were suing me
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.060]   He was joking, obviously
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.060]   Um, wow
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   You are certainly
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.060]   the star of this
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   Well, if that's the one thing you think
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   when you think Kevin Rose
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.060]   Right, raccoon tosser
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.060]   John Gruber says, how sure we are
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.060]   Are we that the thing at Kevin Rose's house
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.060]   is a raccoon, look more like a blogger
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   from a alleyway
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.060]   Oh, oh, oh
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.060]   Wow, so what is it?
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.060]   What is it tossed raccoon? Is that the
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.060]   That account has been suspended
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.060]   Oh, that's a shame
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.060]   You didn't complain about that
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.060]   That's a shame
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.060]   They couldn't get the check mark, I guess
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.060]   You said that's kidding
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.060]   Why would you care?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.060]   Why would you care?
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.060]   Well, that's a shame
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.060]   And so you posted the video on YouTube
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.060]   and you tweeted it
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.060]   And then you went to bed and the next morning
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.060]   It blew up
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.060]   CNN called?
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.060]   CNN has not, no, it was on
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.060]   SF Chronicle, Boston,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.060]   Atlantic, CNET
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.060]   It would have to be by Wednesday, otherwise there's going to be a dead story
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.060]   Tech crunch, I don't know why Tech Crunch said
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.060]   Is this about you, how this kid?
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.060]   Yeah, Ryan Lawley
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.060]   How this kid is this week?
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.060]   There's a time by this business week
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.060]   cover that said how this kid made
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   Oh, I get it
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060]   It's a plan on the business week
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.060]   I get it now
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.060]   Oh boy, this is hilarious
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.060]   Anyway
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.060]   Here's a video
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.060]   Well, this is one of the gorilla
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.060]   tossed raccoon is what that video is
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.060]   There was another video
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.060]   I'm competing with that one for top
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.060]   tossed raccoon
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.060]   No, you should win that
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.060]   Oh, yeah, the gorilla
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   I don't actually want to show that one
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   It's kind of horrendous
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   All VCs claim they have your back
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.060]   but only Kevin Rose will wrestle a raccoon for you
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   How is the VC biz?
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.060]   It's good
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.060]   So are you getting to talk to founders
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.060]   and coach them?
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   Is that a lot of what you do
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.060]   given your experience with TV?
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.060]   I mean, if it's kind of sitting down
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.060]   and drinking a lot of coffee
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.060]   meeting a lot of founders
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.060]   talking about ideas
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.060]   and then occasionally
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   investing in one of them
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.060]   But that's not a big part of what you do
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.060]   Where is it?
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.060]   As far as actually mentoring and things
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.060]   Are you looking for people to give money to?
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.060]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.060]   You are
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.060]   So I probably do
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.060]   10 to 15 deals a year
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.060]   and
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.060]   Just actually a lot
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.060]   That's almost one of months
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.060]   Almost one of months
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.060]   But that's a lot of saying no actually
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.060]   You're doing several meetings a day
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.060]   And
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.060]   What do you look for?
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.060]   An entrepreneur?
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.060]   What are you looking for for you to put money in?
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.060]   I mean, obviously
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.060]   You're not going to put money in a variety
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.060]   A lot of things that aren't in your wheelhouse
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.060]   Sure, so for me it's a consumer Internet
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   Mobile, things like that
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   But it has to be something that's just not
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.060]   another MeToo product
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.060]   I like really original entrepreneurs
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.060]   I remember the first time I met
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   You know, like the vine founder was the one that was
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   most recent
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.060]   Were you on vine for the get sold?
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.060]   So Jack Doris, you got to hold to him
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.060]   Just as I was about to invest
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   So I didn't
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060]   It's fine
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   It's got to kill you
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.060]   But it's one of those things where you see
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.060]   Like someone approach something from a new angle
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.060]   From a kind of original thinking
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.060]   Is what you're looking for in an
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.060]   Not just another Pinterest for this or that
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.060]   Or so
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.060]   Right
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   There are probably a lot of
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.060]   Pinterest
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.060]   There's a lot of clones
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.060]   Facebook's
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.060]   I mean, anytime there is something
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.060]   Especially like there's an event
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   Like, let's say, mailbox gets acquired by drop box
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.060]   For $100 million
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   Right
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.060]   Six months later, I'll see
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.060]   You know, 50, 75
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   New, I can fix mail
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.060]   In box zero
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.060]   Yeah, exactly
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.060]   And so, anytime there's success
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.060]   You see just see a lot of copycats
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.060]   And sometimes they do really well
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.060]   Like, I think
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.060]   The best example of that that I can recall
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   Is Yammer
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   Yammer took Twitter's concept
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.060]   Made it for the enterprise
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.060]   And did quite well
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   Right
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   That was an unusual idea
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.060]   Do you have a trap door in front of your desk
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060]   Just press the button
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.060]   And have them fall?
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.060]   Or ejector seat
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   Would be better
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.060]   Or do amazing
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060]   If the delegation opens the roof
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.060]   Fires them out
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.060]   Well, that'd be good, so
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.060]   Such an thing that comes down
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.060]   Oh, that's good
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.060]   John and I would be better at
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.060]   Rejecting than
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.060]   Yeah, because it'd be funnier
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.060]   You try and pre-qualify
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.060]   I'm a little bit
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.060]   Try and bet I'm a little bit
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.060]   Before you even go and have a coffee
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.060]   So do you have your Moto X with you?
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.060]   I do not have Moto X with me
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.060]   Oh, okay
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   I do not
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   Tried
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   There you go
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.060]   I tried
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   I still have an iPhone
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   I'm just telling
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.060]   Not an Android guy yet
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.060]   I've played with Android quite a bit
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.060]   I'm Android curious
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   It's, you know, I can say some things
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.060]   Like things I like, things I don't like
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.060]   Well, don't you like
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.060]   The fit and finish
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.060]   I still don't think it has the
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060]   Who's there all different?
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.060]   We're talking about the inside
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.060]   We're talking about the butter
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.060]   We're talking about the butter
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.060]   You don't think butter did the trick
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.060]   I don't think butter did the trick
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   I think butter improved a lot of like
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.060]   Little things
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   But I still think they have a ways to go
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.060]   Now have you tried Windows Phone 8
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   Because I find for
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.060]   Lots of butter
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.060]   For polish
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.060]   And just the pure joy of using it
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.060]   All the little pops and
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.060]   You've got a phone
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.060]   I sure do
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.060]   An 8X?
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.060]   Yeah, it's
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.060]   Microsoft gave me that to test it out
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.060]   And I'm going to go to the store
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.060]   Like next week and buy one
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.060]   I love it
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.060]   I love it
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.060]   I hear that, though
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.060]   I hear that, though
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.060]   I hear that one night
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.060]   You want to take a look at that?
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.060]   Why don't you play with my telephone
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.060]   He's playing with this, I'm sure
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.060]   That's a great you have it
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.060]   That's probably the best one
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.060]   I like the 8X, although
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.060]   I would be very tempted
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   By the new Lumia
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.060]   Which has a 41 megapixel
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.060]   Camera in it
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.060]   I'm not going to read your email
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   I'm just going to go there
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   That'll come in handy
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   I have no secrets
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.060]   Oh, have you seen the images?
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060]   Yeah, I saw the images
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.060]   Oh, the images are dramatic
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.060]   Yeah, but this is still limited to the
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.060]   There's no zoom
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.060]   Right
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   Well, what Noki's idea is
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   I think
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.060]   His computation
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.060]   And dynamic range is not
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.060]   The computational photography
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060]   So all we need to do is
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.060]   Get something like an image
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.060]   And we're going to use
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.060]   Cockpit's target
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.060]   Well, you're going to
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   End up going to Photoshop
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.060]   It's all software
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.060]   Yeah
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.060]   So big story
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.060]   I think the week is a Microsoft
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   Thursday on its quarterly
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   Earnings call announcing that
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   They're going to take a $900
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   Hit on Windows RT
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   The Surface RT is going to cost
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   Almost a billion dollars
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.060]   Six million of them in the
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.060]   Warehouse
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.060]   You said $900, 900 million
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.060]   Almost a billion dollar hit
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.060]   Yeah, almost a billion dollar hit
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.060]   How many billions did they have
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   For revenue in that quarter?
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.060]   Well, they can afford it
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.060]   About 50, but they can afford it
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   Fifty billion dollars
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.060]   Why didn't they say that
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.060]   It's like ballet change, you know
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.060]   It's not that they can't afford it
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060]   But it's kind of, first of all
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.060]   Maybe you can help us with this
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.060]   Kevin or any of you
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.060]   Why would a company take a
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   Take, just say, okay, you know what
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   Why wouldn't they dribble it out
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.060]   Over a few quarters
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.060]   Why say we lost a billion
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.060]   It's over
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.060]   Probably for the bookkeeping reasons
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.060]   Yeah, there's something
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   They need to write it on this
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   They have to write it down
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.060]   Or they want to write it down
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]   Clearly they're going to
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.060]   Continue to lose money on this
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060]   Because they see it as the
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060]   Future of PCs
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060]   So they're not going to back down
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.060]   No, they're not going to back down
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.060]   I think they'll abandon
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.060]   The sequel is probably coming, I suspect
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.060]   Maybe
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   You think?
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   Yeah, I think they're going to do
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   Another one and try to do it better
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.060]   So the story was, I think that
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.060]   Because they're taking the right off
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   Because they dropped, they had to
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.060]   Drop the price to 350 bucks
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.060]   On the basic, the base 32 gig model
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   That's 150 bucks less than list
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.060]   And probably significantly less than cost
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   So they're going to take the
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.060]   Loss on it, but you don't think that
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   That's an abandonment of windows
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.060]   RT that they're going to stick with
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.060]   RT
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.060]   Or, see, I think RT is over
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.060]   I think they're going to say
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.060]   Oh, we should have just stuck with windows
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.060]   Hey, RT is bad for users
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.060]   Because they get it and they go
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.060]   What, you can't run windows?
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.060]   Software, whether they're doing
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   Windows 8.1 RT
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.060]   So they're continuing with it
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.060]   You know, they're not stopping with it
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.060]   When they were here in Houston
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.060]   A week ago for the Partners Conference
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.060]   They were giving away, or not giving away
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.060]   But they were giving steep discounts
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   On both the Pro and the RT
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   And there were lines of the attendees
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.060]   That were 90 minutes long to get either of them
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.060]   It reminds me of the Blackberry Playbook
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.060]   Remember when they dropped the price to 99 bucks
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.060]   On the playbook, it sold out
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.060]   And people said, "Oh, Blackberry, you should make more of these"
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.060]   Yeah, no
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   Yeah, so he can lose lots of money
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.060]   No
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.060]   So yeah, of course people will
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   Line up for a $99 tablet
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   When it's cheap, right
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   Right, right
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   And that's about, that's probably, you know, for
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060]   Surface RT as a fire sale
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.060]   That's probably about right for what it's capable
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.060]   That's what it's worth
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]   Mm-hmm
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.060]   One of our chatters works at Microsoft
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   He says, "No, Leo, RT's not dead, we are all in on RT"
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   I think it's confusing, you've got three operating systems now
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.060]   You've got Windows Phone 8, you've got Windows RT
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.060]   And you've got Windows 8 and on the Surface
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.060]   If you're part of the expression, they all look the same
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.060]   If you put them all together, they all have the same
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.060]   Metro Start screen
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.060]   And I think that's confusing for users
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.060]   Because they think that that means it's the same OS and it's not
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.060]   Well, it has the same, like, core, doesn't it?
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   It's the NT kernel in all of it
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.060]   Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can run one software from one on the other
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   I think the average user doesn't care so very much about it
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   About the software that you can run
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.060]   They don't think of software on a phone, they think of apps on a phone
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.060]   And you can run Microsoft Office on a phone
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.060]   And you can run one note on a phone
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.060]   And I think the average user is like, "Ooh, pretty"
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   I mean, eventually, they'll be "woo pretty"
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.060]   Right now, they're just terrified
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   Yeah, I don't know, I don't see anybody saying, "Oh, I look"
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   Well, I do see that, I take it back, but it's usually
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   A small number of people say, "Oh, Windows 8, I love it"
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.060]   Yeah, it's because they're working for Microsoft
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.060]   Or they write a Microsoft News letter
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.060]   I love it!
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.060]   You love Windows 8?
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   Not Windows Phone 8
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.060]   Windows 8?
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   You're using a Mac
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.060]   That's my husband's
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   I love stealing his stuff and not giving it back
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   Yeah, you like because it's the better product
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   I thought those shoes looked a little big on you, actually
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.060]   You know, he's got large feet
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.060]   We're finding them next year
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   So, I'm using Windows 8 on several machines
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   And at first, it was really annoying
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   Windows 8 1 makes a big difference in the preview
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   But to use it is to love it, I think
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.060]   The more you use it, the more you like it
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   As long as I'm running a classic shell
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   You want the start menu
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.060]   Yeah, and the desktop
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   Yes, yes, I think you still need the desktop
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.060]   And one of the reasons I think they're sticking with Windows RT
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.060]   Is because it primarily works on the Metro side
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   And as Microsoft goes on with this design
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.060]   You can bet that the desktop is going to be deprecated
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.060]   And you'll see less and less of it
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   Windows RT on ARM, they probably think of it as their future
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.060]   Yeah, no, I think you're right, I don't know if that's a smart thing
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.060]   If you have an app on your Windows Phone
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.060]   Will that app also work on your Windows tablet?
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   No
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   That's really interesting
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.060]   But developers, they're telling developers it's not that hard to tweak it
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.060]   But developers are doing that and I think Metro apps
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.060]   Are not what people are looking for when they are traditional Windows users
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.060]   They're looking for Windows apps, not full screen tablet apps
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.060]   Well, Microsoft is also, pardon me, you go ahead
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   No, no, okay, I'm just here
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   Microsoft and they've emphasized this in meetings with me
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   They are betting really, really big on HTML5
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.060]   And the mobile web, because the web is the one platform that's consistent
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.060]   Across desktop, tablet and phone
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.060]   That's actually a good point, if you aren't using application
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.060]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me stop you for a second
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.060]   So basically you've been sat down by Microsoft and brainwashed
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.060]   Absolutely, and I loved every minute of it
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   Have you seen these Windows phones? Okay
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.060]   Well, it's ironic because Steve Jobs, when the iPhone came out in 2007
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   Said, hey, web apps, that's the future
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.060]   And obviously, either he knew better and was just
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.060]   They didn't have the app store ready
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.060]   Or he turned around, because a year later the app store comes out
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.060]   And is a huge hit and HTML5 apps did not take off
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.060]   Is HTML5, you're a good guy to ask Kevin, you do mobile development
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   Is HTML5 good enough now?
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.060]   No, I mean the problem is
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.060]   It's HTML5 apps are still really funky and weird
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.060]   And don't have the performance that a native Apple have
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.060]   They don't have access
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.060]   Oh, it's true, they don't have access to all the low level hardware
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.060]   But they're getting it thanks to standard apps
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.060]   Yeah, but when you're going to have access to accelerometer
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.060]   And all these other things that really cool apps are doing
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.060]   Next year, whenever people use stuff's mirroring foot all over the whole issue
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.060]   Well, I know, but Aaron is not developing a bad person
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.060]   Wait a minute, though, your husband is not developing web apps
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   No, he's been brainwashed, so I keep harping on him
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]   You think this is bad, Kevin?
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.060]   But he's got money in where his mouth is
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.060]   He's making apps and he's making them for iOS
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.060]   And he's making apps, he's not doing it as this is ever-lapse
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.060]   So how many things are missing?
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.060]   Like if you want to make any money at all when you're building these apps
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.060]   Sure, if you want to do a fun little like weather app and HTML5
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060]   Yeah, have fun!
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   Forecastio!
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.060]   But like if you want to make real money and tie into a real app store that has paying users
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.060]   You have to build native, you just have to
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.060]   Well, you could run ads on an HTML5 app and make money too
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   Yeah, make like $10
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.060]   Is WebGL not going to help?
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:33.060]   I mean, WebGL gives you, you know, open GL style acceleration on it
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.060]   No, I'm sure eventually it will get there
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   I'm just saying like today, when you sit down with the developer
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.060]   And you talk to them about what they're building
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.060]   They say, "I'm building an iPhone app first"
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   If that works, I'll go Android
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.060]   And Windows isn't even on like, they don't even have a
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.060]   I don't even know a single Windows developer anymore
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.060]   I think Microsoft are basically...
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:56.060]   You know, paths just announced and Instagram just announced that they're going to do Windows phone apps
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.060]   But I think Microsoft...
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.060]   Because Microsoft pays them, give an app a match
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.060]   Absolutely, absolutely, I've heard...
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.060]   Here's a hundred million, would you please do an app?
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.060]   They'll actually hire a dev house, like up in Washington
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   And they'll pay developers to bring and port these really popular applications over
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.060]   They have to, I wouldn't blame them, they have to
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.060]   It's an economic decision, you're gonna...
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.060]   Whether or not you like HTML5 or even think there's a future
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.060]   You have a limited amount of resources
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   I think Aaron's made that same decision
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   He's saying, "I'm gonna put everlapse on the iPhone, that's the place where I'm gonna start"
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.060]   Well, he's a filthy hipster, I can't answer for those decisions
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   Will this marriage last, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   Oh, now with that shape, he's not much of a hipster
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.060]   He's kind of cute
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.060]   I know, he...
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   Any of that look at those dimples, hey babe
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   Yeah, we should get Aaron up here to defend himself
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.060]   Anyway, everlapse.com, this is actually a cool idea
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.060]   It's a flipbook, so we'll give him a plug
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.060]   But it is iOS, Aaron, are you gonna do an Android device, Android app, if this succeeds?
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.060]   It's exactly what Kevin said, he says
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.060]   Thank you
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.060]   Well, Kevin talks to a few developers, once in a while
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.060]   I have a feeling he has kind of an idea of what they're thinking
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.060]   So the question to ask him, is he gonna do a Windows Phone app?
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.060]   Ever Windows Phone?
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.060]   Please, please, please, please, please
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.060]   If they pay you, yeah
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.060]   If they pay him, if they pay you
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.060]   Windows Phone is a gorgeous...
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.060]   No, he's actually saying, it's a beautiful platform
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.060]   But you have to think of the economics, how many phones are out there
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.060]   and how much money does it make?
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   All three of the people will love it
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   It's just like, I'm not knocking the fact that there's these Windows developers
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.060]   because I know they're out there, it actually is a challenge
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:33.060]   Well, it doesn't Phone Gap and don't other like cross-platform tools support stuff like Windows 8 now?
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060]   Sure
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   Because they know it's lovely and they know developers want to and don't have the resources
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.060]   Yeah, I mean, I've heard about these different applications that you can port your application easily over to Windows 8
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:47.060]   I don't know how well they work, but you know, it all comes down to when you have a team of three or four people working on a startup
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.060]   Like, do they even have like, 10% time to go and spend porting their app over there?
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.060]   They're fixing bugs, they're doing all the other things that they're wearing the 10 hats that they have to wear as an entrepreneur
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.060]   Well, they've got time to make a Google Glass app
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.060]   Aaron's skies are making a lot of people with that
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.060]   I wouldn't advocate making like a default Google Glass app right away
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.060]   Oh, that's nuts! There's no market at all
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.060]   Not yet, not yet, you know, it would be what glass are developers and hipsters
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.060]   And they're not buying stuff
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.060]   Aaron, she's ruining your machine
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.060]   Sorry, but you have to
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   No sugar and laptop screw together fine
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.060]   It's not a problem
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060]   No problem
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.060]   Well, that's a good time to take a break
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   Sweet and low is fine
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.060]   It's not sticky
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.060]   No, it's not
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.060]   It's just a chemical stew
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.060]   Yes, sir, sir
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.060]   I like it that you brought it, do you bring China a China tea cup?
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.060]   This is my tea cup, well I always have to use this as coffee mugs
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.060]   And this is... I'm a lady
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.060]   That's that
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   Joly, the only guest who comes fully accessorized and I love that about you
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   Joly, how Dell is here, what are you doing these days, Joly?
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.060]   Well, I work for VentureBeat.com
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.060]   You haven't changed yet, but I'm not sure
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.060]   You haven't changed jobs yet?
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060]   No, I never will
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.060]   The last job I have will be at VentureBeat
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.060]   Until they get bought by like News Corp or something
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.060]   Then that's all I'll have to grab
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.060]   Yeah, until then I'm going down with the ship
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.060]   I just love it, I've never had such a wonderful time
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.060]   And if I may say one thing I'm working on an awful lot
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.060]   Is DevBeat, this is VentureBeat's first developer conference
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.060]   Coming up in November and you're letting me do all the programming
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   So it's gonna be a three ring circus of code
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   That's cool
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.060]   Yeah, it is
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.060]   So where's the conference gonna be?
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:30.060]   You know, the Regency Center is this old Masonic lodge in San Francisco
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.060]   It's super goth, super dark
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   And that's how I like it
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   Actually, if I'm not mistaken, that's where the old Avalon Ballroom used to be
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.060]   Oh, it's the Ballroom
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.060]   And there's a...
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   John and I got high there in 1970
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.060]   I remember that
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   Yeah, I don't remember
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.060]   We were at the Bravo Conference concert
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.060]   Actually, Zappa did do a conference
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.060]   No, I was there, you were there
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.060]   I remember looking at all the pictures and the out of the blue says "Tits"
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.060]   It was very strange
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:05.060]   Anyway, there is a miniature version of the Regency of the Avalon Ballroom
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   One floor below
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   No, yeah, I know
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   Actually, it's above
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.060]   There's a smaller stage above which they call the lodge
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.060]   And then there's the main stage with the big balcony around it
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.060]   I've got stuff planned for every floor
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.060]   This thing developers are gonna have so much fun
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.060]   Where can they find out more?
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.060]   This sounds like a great event
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   Venturebeat.com/events/devbeat2013
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   Alright
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.060]   Yeah, buy your tickets now while they're cheap
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   We will have more with Kevin Rose
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   With Jolie Odell
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   With John C. de Vorac
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   Mr. Dwight Silverman
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   As Twit continues
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   In a moment, but first a word from stamps.com
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   If you are doing mailing
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   You do not want to be going to the post office
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.060]   When Jolie starts to
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   Ship
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   Her Berry Cherry Jam
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   To Etsy buyers all over the world
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   When the raccoons
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.060]   Start to make Kevin Rose T-shirts
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.060]   Kill Kevin Rose T-shirts
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.060]   They're going to want to use
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.060]   Stamps.com
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.060]   Does this give you
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   Willies when I do them?
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   Are you nervous to make you nervous?
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.060]   Stamps.com
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.060]   Means you can print your own legal U.S. postage
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   From your computer, your printer
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.060]   You never have to go to the post office
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.060]   And you don't need a postage meter by the way
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.060]   You'll save like 100%
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.060]   No, I'm sorry
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.060]   It's 100 times less expensive
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060]   That's like
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.060]   100...
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.060]   That's like a thousand percent
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.060]   It's a deal
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.060]   That's a ten thousand percent
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.060]   Wow
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.060]   It doesn't even...
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.060]   If I say that, it sounds like you're making that up
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.060]   It sounds like bull crap
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.060]   But it's true
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.060]   You know why postage meters
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   Just not effective anymore
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.060]   Not an econo
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.060]   The ink is so expensive
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.060]   With stamps.com
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.060]   You get the USB scale
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.060]   You plug that on the computer
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.060]   You plop the letter or package on there
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.060]   You always have exactly the right postage
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.060]   You even should suggest what class of mail is appropriate
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.060]   For that particular package
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.060]   I want you to try stamps.com
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.060]   We've got a no risk trial offer

[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.060]   To make up for that
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.060]   And of course a month free of stamps.com
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   Stamps.com
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   If you do mailing
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.060]   You need
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.060]   Stamps.com

[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   TWIT
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.060]   I don't know where we found this
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.060]   Or why we haven't
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.060]   But I believe it's a raccoon puppet
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.060]   And frankly I missed a bet
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   I should have interviewed you
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.060]   So Kevin
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.060]   How do you really feel about raccoons?
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.060]   I'll tell you what
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   After the show we'll give this to you
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.060]   Toaster can you?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.060]   I'll tear it up and
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.060]   With the post traumatic stress
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   Exactly
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.060]   You'll just moment
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.060]   No but it's a way for him to kind of
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.060]   Process it out
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   Take another video
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.060]   With that and the dog
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.060]   You make another
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.060]   Put some advertising on there
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.060]   You have Toaster throw this down the stairs
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   I don't know if this is actually going to happen
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.060]   It's just across Twitter
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.060]   The Daily Mail
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   Tomorrow morning in London
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.060]   We'll have this as the headline
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.060]   And I think it's true
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.060]   The Daily Mail has had a campaign
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.060]   To get the British government
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   To insist that porn be blocked in every
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.060]   Home in the UK
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.060]   I've been hearing about this
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.060]   According to the mail
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.060]   PM David Cameron will announce
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.060]   On Monday
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   That there will be a default
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.060]   Block on net porn in every
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060]   Home in Britain
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060]   You'll have to go
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.060]   And ask to have it turned off
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   If you want porn
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.060]   Well I'm proud to be an American
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   Welcome to the new world order
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.060]   Can you believe that?
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   I can't believe that
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   How did you?
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.060]   Yeah how do they figure out what's
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.060]   Porn?
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   Is it just certain sites?
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   Is it?
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.060]   Well remember in Australia
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.060]   They proposed this
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.060]   And it was over turned
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.060]   But the idea is
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.060]   You buy a commercial program
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.060]   That's designed to filter this stuff out
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.060]   Probably black lists
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.060]   There are filters that actually look for flesh
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.060]   I hope they don't use those
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   Because those work very well
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.060]   Flesh
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.060]   Yeah
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.060]   A certain amount of flesh
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.060]   You say that must be a porn site
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   You know 50% flesh
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.060]   That's a porn site
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.060]   But if you're just wearing a peach colored
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   Unotard
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.060]   Well exactly
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.060]   That's why it doesn't work too well
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.060]   Is there a site where we can see that?
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   Because I'm going to block it
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.060]   I'm going to block it right now
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.060]   Apple's Dev site has been down
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.060]   Since Thursday
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.060]   And this is kind of interesting too
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.060]   They say when you go to
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.060]   developer.apple.com and click
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.060]   This is the site for paid developers
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.060]   They say we'll be back soon
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.060]   We apologize that maintenance is taking
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.060]   Longer than expected
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.060]   Since Thursday
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.060]   During an iOS beta
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.060]   It looks like it's back
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   People are starting to think that it's
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.060]   Been hacked
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.060]   A number of developers have tweeted
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   I keep getting password reset
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   Emails from Apple
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.060]   But that doesn't mean an attack
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.060]   That means somebody's trying to get their
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.060]   Password, I don't know if it's related
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.060]   But it is a long time
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.060]   Four days
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   Someone
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   Leo it is back
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.060]   It's back up and running
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.060]   It is back up and running?
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.060]   Yep
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.060]   Yep
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   Well I you know
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.060]   There goes that story
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   No because it wasn't
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.060]   I checked right before the show
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   It was down for several days
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.060]   It was down for several days
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   No it's not I'm sorry
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.060]   No it's not
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   Maybe it's a regional
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.060]   You have to go to
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.060]   developer.apple.com
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.060]   There it is
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.060]   iOS dev center
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.060]   And it's down
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.060]   Yeah there it is
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   So main page is up
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.060]   Yeah yeah yeah
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.060]   In fact there's quite a bit of stuff
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   That's up still
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.060]   But the iOS dev center
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   Specifically is down
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.060]   Perhaps Apple's broke
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.060]   Maybe they ran out of money
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.060]   Couldn't pay the bill
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.060]   The bill can have the ISB
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.060]   It happened to Detroit
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.060]   Is that a shocker huh?
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   Well it wasn't much of a shocker
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.060]   You saw that coming
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.060]   The Mac dev center is down also
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   Oh that's interesting
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.060]   Yeah both of them
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.060]   Yeah generally
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.060]   While you might need to do maintenance
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.060]   You really wouldn't want to do a four-day
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.060]   Maintenance doing an extended beta test
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   Of iOS
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.060]   Especially with a ship date
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.060]   Probably that's about a month off
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.060]   Maybe they can't find the reset button
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.060]   On the servers
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.060]   Apple reportedly considering
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.060]   Now this may be Kevin you have some insight
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.060]   On this because the Israeli developer
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.060]   PrimeSense denies it
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.060]   But it has been reported that the Apple's
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.060]   Considering buying them
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.060]   PrimeSense is a big deal
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.060]   And they're not really paying them
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.060]   PrimeSense is the 3D body sensor
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.060]   Firm that designed and sold
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.060]   And licensed Microsoft Connect
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.060]   A body sensor technology
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.060]   This is an Israeli publication
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.060]   Callist.co.il
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.060]   Says that PrimeSense says that's BS
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.060]   But what was this usually
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.060]   Pre-accurate?
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.060]   They're just licensing the text
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.060]   Yeah it seems
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.060]   You would think
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.060]   That Microsoft wouldn't want to have happen
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.060]   John where's your bull crap omelet
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.060]   Around this one?
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.060]   I'm actually reading from the chat room
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.060]   And somebody has some comments about the Apple story
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   Oh yeah what do they say?
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.060]   Last Thursday an intruder attempted to
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.060]   Secure personal information of our
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.060]   Register developers from our
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.060]   Developer website sensitive personal information
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.060]   Was encrypted and cannot be accessed
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.060]   However we've not been able to rule out the
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.060]   Possibility at some developers names
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.060]   Bailing as blah blah blah has been
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.060]   This was this a mailing from Apple that they sent out?
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.060]   I don't know it says anyway
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.060]   They said August 9th somebody else says
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.060]   When it comes back up
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.060]   August 9th
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.060]   That could be bull crap
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.060]   That doesn't sound right
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.060]   Why would you pick a date?
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.060]   If you bring your servers
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   We're going to take two weeks
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.060]   To as possible
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   So this is a website update from Apple
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.060]   The August doesn't make any sense
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   On 9 to 5 Mac
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   Yeah there you go
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   What the heck?
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   And did somebody else ask
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.060]   John what's jolly eating?
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.060]   Jolly?
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.060]   What are you eating today?
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   I'm eating cinnamon from cake muffins
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   With
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.060]   Creme fresh
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.060]   Oh my God
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.060]   Sounds delicious
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   And she also brought home a jam
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.060]   I've got the berry cherry
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.060]   That's blackberry cherry
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.060]   Mr. Rose took the Bing cherry
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.060]   Like stuff Bing
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.060]   Is that why you took it?
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.060]   No, that's not a dead is way
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.060]   So you have it back at Google headquarters
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   Wow
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.060]   I got Bing in a bottle
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.060]   And John what did you take there?
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.060]   You're a strawberries
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   I took strawberries
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   Smart man
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.060]   Always go for the strawberries
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]   Yeah you can't go wrong
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.060]   Can't go wrong with strawberries
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   Alright well we'll watch
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.060]   With interest on that Apple story
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   That's kind of far-fetched
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   August 9th
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.060]   Yeah I'm not buying it
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.060]   The other story makes more sense
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.060]   In order to prevent a security threat
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.060]   Like this is Apple
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.060]   In order to prevent a security threat
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.060]   Like this from happening again
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.060]   We're completely overhauling our
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.060]   Developer systems
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   Updating our server software
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.060]   And rebuilding the entire database
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.060]   We've been working around the clock
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.060]   Sounds like a cover-up story to me
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.060]   Apple says we plan to have the site up again soon
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.060]   Not August 9th
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.060]   But that, this makes sense
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.060]   This statement makes sense
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   That's kind of what you'd expect to hear
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   I think rebuilding the whole database
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.060]   Is more than a weekend's worth of work though right?
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   Good thing?
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   Depends how automated it is
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.060]   I guess really the big question is
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.060]   What was the exploit?
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.060]   And they must obviously
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.060]   They must think that there might be more
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.060]   Holes in this
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.060]   And they really got to look at this more close-down
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.060]   That's something you don't want to have happen
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.060]   What you really don't Marco Arment pointed this out
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.060]   What you really hope is that these dev certificates
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.060]   Didn't leak out the master root certificate
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   Because if it did then you could create dev certificates
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.060]   A bad guy could create certificates that would say
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   This is legitimate Apple software
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   Apple has moved to that certificate authentication system
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.060]   Both on iOS and on the desktop
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.060]   You cannot install an iOS app with a new app
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.060]   An iOS app without a certificate from Apple
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.060]   And on the desktop it will warn you
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.060]   And you have to manually override that
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.060]   If those dev certificates got out
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.060]   Right, this is a big disaster
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   Leo they mailed me today and said August 5th
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.060]   Wow
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.060]   This is room 2 by the way
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   Where I reside on the chat
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.060]   Yeah I don't see this in our chat
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.060]   You're in the back channel
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.060]   We're in the back channel
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.060]   We're getting the good stuff
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.060]   This is shady room 2
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:19.060]   Apple also busy this week with a update to logic
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.060]   Answering the question some people had
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.060]   Well how do you do upgrades in the app store?
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.060]   You don't
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.060]   Apple's never made that possible for developers
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.060]   You have to just create a new version
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.060]   And a number of applications have done that
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.060]   And now Apple's done that too
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.060]   They've released Logic Pro X
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   A new version of Apple's Logic music making software
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.060]   And there's no upgrade path
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.060]   If you bought Logic before that doesn't matter
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   Admittedly it's a very affordable $199 for a very complete music package
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.060]   But still, I think Apple would want to have an upgrade path
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.060]   For people who develop for the Mac App Store
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.060]   Really impressed 32 gig's worth of loops
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.060]   A whole bunch of stuff for $199
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.060]   I immediately downloaded it and made a hit single
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.060]   You did?
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.060]   Right later
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   Play it
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.060]   I had it already in?
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   We're still working out the negotiating
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.060]   The deal
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.060]   That doesn't mean you can't play it
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.060]   Play it now
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.060]   That would be leaking it out
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.060]   No, no
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.060]   Jay-Z and I
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   You know he's a little sensitive on these kinds of things
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   He's a bit before
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.060]   He was nervous about the analog hole
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.060]   Well you bet
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.060]   Just the words analog hole make me nervous
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.060]   And well it should
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.060]   As well it should
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.060]   I am not going to bring up prism unless somebody else does
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.060]   We don't need to talk about it
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.060]   You just said something that I think of the entire American public
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.060]   Are saying I'm so tired of prism
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.060]   But we can't afford to be can we?
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.060]   I mean these companies are just now coming out and saying
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   Yes we've been
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.060]   They're basically saying
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   Yes we've been subject to this thing and we would really love it
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.060]   If the federal government stepped in and made it so that we didn't have to do this
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.060]   That's exactly what
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.060]   Oh, oh, oh, good one
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.060]   Microsoft just said because Microsoft most recently bit by this
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   And I just love that they all told me the day it broke
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.060]   I talked to all four of the big tech companies in Silicon Valley
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.060]   That I keep in touch with
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.060]   And they were like no no we have no knowledge of this
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.060]   We didn't do this and now there's a oh gosh
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.060]   I could just get all spun up
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060]   Apparently she's going to get all worked out
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.060]   Well Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.060]   Because I knew at the time they were lying
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   When every single person says I have no knowledge
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.060]   Having no knowledge is like
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.060]   The kind of military intelligence phrase that you use
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.060]   But what they should say is no comment
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.060]   I don't know, they shouldn't lie
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.060]   They should tell, they should just say I have no comment
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   Well no comment means you have knowledge
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:46.060]   No comment is like no comment
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.060]   One of the people I talked to led me down the road of
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.060]   And if we did have knowledge we probably couldn't talk about it
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   Because there might have been a gag order
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.060]   And I was like so you're saying
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.060]   That's right, and now there's security letters
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.060]   Right, they can't admit anything
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.060]   And that's the best answer, that one right there
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.060]   If we had knowledge, if we could tell you
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.060]   Well actually if you have a national security letter
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.060]   You can't even say that
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.060]   What can you say if you have an NSL?
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.060]   Nothing
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.060]   So if Jolie O'Dell calls you John C. Devorak
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.060]   And you've got an NSL saying
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   You must reveal every user of channel Devorak
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.060]   How about this?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.060]   The line goes down the screen
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.060]   Jolie, just call me, say something
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.060]   Hi John, how you doing?
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.060]   Good
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.060]   Cool, what you wearing girl?
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.060]   Yeah, well, how is this phone call supposed to go?
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.060]   I don't know
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   What you said to the Google guy when you call?
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.060]   I always do
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.060]   I'm not like a what you wearing girl
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.060]   I don't know about that
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   So if I'm like so, John, Prism
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.060]   Yeah, what about it?
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.060]   I sense that you guys are involved
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.060]   See that?
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.060]   He's totally involved
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.060]   Here's the thing, I think he hasn't even said no
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.060]   He's at A
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.060]   There's two hands
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.060]   I think these companies wanted the media and wanted people to know that they were being gagged
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:00.060]   Well as Microsoft said, this reflects very badly on us
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.060]   Yeah, yeah
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:05.060]   So I think though that they wanted people to know so that they could wiggle
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   out of having to do that in the future
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   Because I'm sure as bad as it looks
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.060]   I'm sure a lot of them felt bad about having to do it
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.060]   You know, and not having any control
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.060]   And not having any control in the process
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.060]   Look at the European Union's reaction to this
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   I mean, the very next thing they say is
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.060]   Well in that case, we can't use any Microsoft software
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.060]   He is always weird about privacy though
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   Well, that's a big, but it's a market
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.060]   And if you're China, if you're the Chinese market
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.060]   I mean, we said let's not use Huawei phones
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.060]   Because Huawei's owned by the Chinese military
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.060]   They're going to say well Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple are owned by the US military
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.060]   Oh no, you use Facebook in China anyways
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.060]   It's like a different country and everything
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.060]   But Google and Apple are desperately trying to sell phones into that market
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.060]   That is a huge market
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060]   Well Android already owns
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.060]   See Android already owns China
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.060]   But the Chinese government thinks that
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.060]   People are too obsessed with Android
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.060]   And that Android is too controlling
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   They've said in the statement from the intelligence agencies over there
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.060]   So that's all, sorry
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.060]   So let's not talk about prison
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.060]   Talking too much, but I think Kevin's reaction is
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.060]   I've heard enough, I don't want to hear anymore
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.060]   But it's just always at the top of tech
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   Me, you never tell my turn
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.060]   I'm fine, I'm fine, so I do too
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   Breaking stories around prison
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.060]   I of course want to hear that
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.060]   It's just like every single day
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.060]   It's another thing
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.060]   Well, if we were in the middle of a world war
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.060]   You'd want to know
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.060]   Like the new world wars
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.060]   An intelligence war
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.060]   It's a war that has to be a technology
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.060]   No, I understand that
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060]   The issue that I have
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.060]   So I'll say one thing that
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   That is interesting about this whole case
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.060]   You're leading us with it
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   I'm going to tell you one thing that's interesting
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.060]   Well, one thing that nobody knows
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.060]   Is this about the raccoon?
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.060]   Is this about the raccoon?
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.060]   Nobody knows this
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.060]   I'll have to tell her
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.060]   Nobody knows this
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.060]   I want to hear something nobody knows, don't you?
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.060]   So, I don't know how to anonymize this in the right way
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.060]   This has nothing to do with Google in the first place
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.060]   This is a friend of a friend that I talked to
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.060]   That has used Prism before
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:09.060]   And they said it was like a very helpful tool
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.060]   And one of the things that was really interesting
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.060]   Is that they said that
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.060]   When they use Prism
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.060]   They have to fill out tons and tons of paperwork
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.060]   To use it in the first place
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.060]   And when they use it
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.060]   The court might not reject it
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.060]   But what they will say is
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.060]   They'll ask for more information
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.060]   They'll say, "Okay, we're not going to reject this
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.060]   What's the name of that court?"
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   The FISA court
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.060]   So, they won't outright reject it
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.060]   But they'll say, "You have to give us more detail
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.060]   On these ten different points"
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.060]   So, there's a ton of hurdles built in to use it in the first place
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.060]   I think the person you really have to worry about
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.060]   Is the system administrator
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.060]   That has access to Prism
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.060]   That is sitting there
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.060]   They can just type in anything they want
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.060]   What are the controls like at that level?
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.060]   Not when an agency is coming in to use it
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.060]   Through the proper channels
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.060]   More about the people that are actually writing the code
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   That have the low level access to that software
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.060]   Because those guys are basically hackers
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   Now, is that prisoner?
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   They could be
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   Just normal spy guide stuff that every company does
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.060]   And they disclose and transparency reports
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   Or is that actual Prism?
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.060]   What do you mean?
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.060]   I'm talking about actual Prism
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.060]   Where you type in a number
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060]   And you can see who
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   The example that was given to me is
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   You find a terrorist phone
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.060]   That you capture somehow
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.060]   And you want to see who in the United States
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   They've been talking to
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.060]   That was the prime example
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.060]   That's an example
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.060]   Which at that makes sense to me
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.060]   I think you would want to know that
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.060]   So you have this phone and you have these numbers
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   And you say, "Well, let's see what other traffic is
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.060]   Around these numbers"
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.060]   How many times have you been talking to these?
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.060]   Who do they talk to?
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   Who else do these people talk to?
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.060]   One of the things that was revealed in a
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.060]   Congressional testimony this week was
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   It could be friends of friends
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   It could be friends of friends of friends
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   It could be third to three degrees of separation
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   Which means that net could be cast quite wide
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   Right
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   I mean, there's a lot of gray area here
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.060]   And that's why it really sucks
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.060]   Because it's
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.060]   For me, it's just like
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.060]   I can see the positive sides of it
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.060]   And I can also see
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.060]   Where if it's abused, this is horrible
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   And that's the issue is
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   It could be abused
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.060]   Absolutely
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.060]   What are the checks and balances
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.060]   Who's watching
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.060]   And what was apparent is that
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.060]   At least until now, no one was really paying attention
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   Well, and it was refreshing for me to hear
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.060]   That they actually do push back
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.060]   They may not say no, but they do push back
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.060]   From more detail
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.060]   I hope that's true
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.060]   I think that can change at the drop of a hat
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.060]   The feeling is often that the Fiza courts
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.060]   Are rubber stamp
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.060]   Right, exactly
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.060]   And that's what that was the message I was getting
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.060]   It was not
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   It's not that they say no, but they do push back
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.060]   All the time
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.060]   It was a former member of the Fiza court
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.060]   Who was complaining, in fact
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.060]   I believe he quit the Fiza court
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.060]   Because there wasn't enough push back
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.060]   And that the government
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   Was being taken at its face value to offer
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.060]   The least the good thing about this
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.060]   Is that it has everyday people talking about
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.060]   Some of the issues that we've been talking about
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   For years
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.060]   And that's a good benefit to it
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.060]   And if I'm not mistaken, that judge
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.060]   That quit the Fiza court
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.060]   Believed that there should be more
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   Adversarial aspects
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   There should be somebody in the...
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   There's nobody on the other side
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.060]   Saying, "Hey, wait a minute, this is bull crap"
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   There should be a...
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.060]   Who becomes a star chamber
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.060]   They need a U
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.060]   They do
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.060]   I need money
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.060]   McClatchy reporting that the Congress is
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.060]   Crowing increasingly wary of NSA domestic
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.060]   Surveillance programs and may in fact
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.060]   Take legislative action as early as next week
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.060]   I think they're feeling the pressure
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.060]   And I think it's important that we continue
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   Well, the guy who wrote the Patriot Act
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.060]   Sensenbrenner
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   He went on and he went crazy with these guys
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.060]   Saying, "What are you doing with my phone numbers?"
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.060]   I feel a...
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.060]   Yeah, that's when they get pissed off, isn't it?
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.060]   Are you spying on us?
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.060]   Yeah
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.060]   Says that we didn't put 215
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.060]   And we didn't put that wordy in there
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   So you could do it more
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.060]   Sensenbrenner said the problem is
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.060]   The Patriot Act is going to sunset in 2015
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.060]   You're not going to be able to remove
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.060]   You're not going to be able to renew it
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.060]   If you don't have some precautions put in here
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.060]   You're not going to get a renewal in 2015
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.060]   And he wants to have it renewed
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   And I think this is true
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.060]   It is a useful tool
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   But you've got to put in the checks and balances
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   All those terrorist attacks that we've had
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.060]   Oh, it's every day
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.060]   See, you say that, but then the defense is
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   You didn't have them
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.060]   That's a lie to them
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.060]   You didn't have them
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.060]   Because we stopped
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.060]   Well, then they didn't stop Boston
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.060]   How come they didn't stop the shoe bomb
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.060]   The Boston was unusual
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   They didn't stop the shoe bomber
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.060]   The public did
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.060]   They didn't stop the crotch bomber
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   The public did
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.060]   They didn't stop Boston
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.060]   They didn't stop anything
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.060]   That I can tell except a couple of setups
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.060]   In fact, there was a hearing in Congress
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   That was done to the
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.060]   Staffs of all the senators
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   Where a bunch of guys come out of us
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.060]   Think Tank and they discussed this
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.060]   And they went over those so-called
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.060]   50 incidents, 10 in the USA
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.060]   And the guy says they're bogus
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.060]   Almost all of them had to do with moving money
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.060]   Into terrorist organizations
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.060]   All these great busts that the NSA did
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.060]   But that had nothing to do with
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.060]   The money had nothing to do with terrorism per se
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.060]   We're not seeing terror
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.060]   This is not Israel
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   We're going to take a break
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.060]   When we come back
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.060]   I ended on that
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.060]   Oh, it's good
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   You got the final word
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.060]   I'm like, "Yo, yeah!"
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.060]   When we come back
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.060]   We're going to talk about
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.060]   Here comes Defcon
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.060]   This is always an exciting time of the year
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   When the hackers get together
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   Start their
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.060]   Put their slide decks together
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.060]   All the new exploits
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   We've got a big one
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.060]   We'll talk about in just a little bit
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   You haven't been in the death con
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   I've been in the years, yeah
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.060]   They're now saying
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060]   Don't go if you're a Fed
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.060]   Yeah, they'll work
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.060]   So can you go?
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   I can't go
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.060]   No, I don't know
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.060]   Where's the black hat?
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.060]   It's black hat, this is
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.060]   No, it's definitely not
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.060]   So there's black hat
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.060]   Which is kind of the official one
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.060]   In Defcon, which is the fun one
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.060]   Right after
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.060]   They're both in Vegas
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.060]   It's too hot in Vegas right now
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.060]   It's coming up in August
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.060]   You grew up there, you ought to know
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.060]   I was there a few weeks ago, it was 117
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.060]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   Crazy
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.060]   The new record

[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.060]   It's not just cheesy

[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.060]   Is so good
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   You can not only say

[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.060]   Angry Thumbs up
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.060]   There you go

[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.060]   Thumbs up
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.060]   How about a two thumbs up?
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.060]   Should we do that?
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.060]   The cheesier the better
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:42.060]   Let's go

[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.060]   Hey!
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.060]   I killed the Recomb
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.060]   Hey, what people?

[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.060]   By the way, this is a torture
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.060]   Sign up for a free account
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.060]   You don't need a credit card
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.060]   Or anything
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.060]   You'll be able to search the

[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   You can use the light box
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   Which means you can save
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:15.060]   You know, images if you want
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.060]   Some inspiration
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.060]   I found a great way to get
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.060]   Inspired for a blog post
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060]   You know, so I start looking at
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.060]   Images and stuff
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.060]   So that's raccoon, but you see
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.060]   You can also say
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.060]   Angry, say, raccoon
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.060]   You can qualify this
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.060]   Wait a minute, you're not looking
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   At my raccoons
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   There you go, that's an angry
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.060]   Raccoon, right?
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.060]   Chad decided to go off on his
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.060]   Own search
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   It's that fun, they've got a
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.060]   Great iPad app
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   I want you to take a look at
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   Shutterstock, they've got the
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.060]   Spectrum tool, which lets you say
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.060]   I only want blue angry raccoons
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.060]   That kind of thing
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.060]   Great way to get creative

[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   It's a kitty in a paper bag
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.060]   Who just loves that?
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.060]   Let's just spend the rest of the show
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.060]   Watching kittens
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.060]   Did you see the...
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:16.060]   Look at his little tail
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.060]   Can you do, you can do that, aww
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.060]   No, you don't do it that well
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.060]   I don't
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.060]   I wonder if you're really a girl
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.060]   The hell?
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.060]   Aww
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.060]   She looks like one
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.060]   Aww
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.060]   Thank you, John
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.060]   Look at that kitty cat, aww
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.060]   Kiki!
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.060]   Have you seen the kitten in the lizard?
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.060]   It was on Google+
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.060]   Isn't that kind of... I'm not a cat fan
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.060]   But this was...
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.060]   I mean, you know, the cat animated gifts
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.060]   I'm not a fan
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.060]   But this one...
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.060]   Oh my God, you can't not love it
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.060]   Let me see if I can find it
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.060]   So Leo, have you seen me albify?
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.060]   No, what's me albify?
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.060]   Go to
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.060]   cron.com/withcats
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.060]   Okay, hold on, let me show you first
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.060]   Wow!
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.060]   That cat does not like that lizard
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   Oh, that's a great...
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.060]   The lizard's not moving much
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.060]   That's amazing
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.060]   The cat is just decided
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.060]   It's like those sheep that get paralyzed
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   When they get scared and they fall over
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.060]   Yeah, yeah, the sleeping sh*t
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.060]   It's like the rodeo steers
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.060]   Actually, it turns out
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.060]   If you search for cat and lizard
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.060]   You find...
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.060]   You know what was it?
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.060]   cron.com/withcats
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:31.060]   You're telling me the Houston Chronicle
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   Has an entire page
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:36.060]   No, no, that's what the albify does
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.060]   The albify takes
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:41.060]   A website and replaces all the images with cats
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.060]   That's great
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   So...
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.060]   You know, there's a theory that
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.060]   So I set up for me to get from cats
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.060]   Yes, apparently
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.060]   Toxoplasmosis
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.060]   It makes cat ladies
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.060]   Yes, and I think it makes people like cats
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.060]   Supposedly
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.060]   So here's the theory
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   Toxoplasmosis is a parasite
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.060]   Right
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.060]   It leaves in cats
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060]   But part of the cycle is
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.060]   As to getting humans
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.060]   Right, yeah
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.060]   And so it comes out in the cat poop
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.060]   Humans touch cat poop
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.060]   They get it inside themselves
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.060]   And then they fall in love with cats
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.060]   Humans are handling cat poop
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.060]   And don't they have it coming?
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.060]   Here's the key in this parasite's life cycle
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.060]   It has to get the cat then
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.060]   To ingest the human
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.060]   Otherwise the life cycle is cut off
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.060]   There you go
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060]   So the theory behind this
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.060]   It's something that they can't
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.060]   Toxoplasmosis
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.060]   What?
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.060]   Oh, the cat ladies who die and get eaten by other cat poop
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.060]   The Toxoplasmosis parasite
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.060]   Let me explain
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.060]   The Toxoplasmosis parasite
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060]   Thesis
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.060]   Am I wrong?
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.060]   No, you're dead on
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.060]   It's all parasites have a life cycle
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.060]   And often humans are part of that life cycle
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.060]   They lay eggs in your brain
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   And they're pretty horrible
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060]   Yeah, that's the only one to show
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060]   Right, exactly
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.060]   Next thing you know, you're on twit
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.060]   So the Toxoplasmosis life cycle is cat human
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.060]   Actually it's cat animal
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.060]   But the key is that in order to continue the life cycle
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.060]   The cat has to be able to re-consume the
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.060]   The eggs or whatever it is
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060]   The humans outlive the cat
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.060]   So the thesis is that Toxoplasmosis somehow
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.060]   Modifies the neurology of the host
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   To make it love cats, to make it hang out with cats
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   So that the cats can eat it
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]   Now this would work with big cats
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.060]   Not so much with kitties
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.060]   Well, maybe they're licking
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.060]   And who knows what they're up to
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060]   So the...
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.060]   I don't trust cats
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.060]   This is the thesis
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060]   The cat lady and all that licking
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.060]   Cat lady have labeled cats
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.060]   The cat lady have laid stage Toxoplasmosis
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.060]   That is making their brain modified
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.060]   So they have to have cats around them
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.060]   Right, lots of cats
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.060]   And the idea being eventually the cats get to eat them
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.060]   Yes, pretty crazy
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.060]   And many cats do
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.060]   That's some grey garden stuff right there
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.060]   It's very grey garden
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.060]   It's not really...
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   Actually...
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   Heck news
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060]   They had a raccoon in grey gardens
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060]   Remember coming in the water sites?
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060]   Mm-hmm
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.060]   See, only Kevin had been there
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.060]   Maybe they'd never been in that movie
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.060]   Well, that would have been a shame for the queer community
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.060]   This is a great movie
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.060]   Okay
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.060]   Are you a grey gardens fan?
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   I don't know if fan is the right word
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.060]   I like to watch a shocking horror
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.060]   It's a strangest movie
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.060]   Oh, it's so bizarre
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   Documentary
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:01.060]   That cousins of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.060]   They looked at its wallet
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.060]   They were hoarders
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.060]   And they were just strange stories
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.060]   In a mansion
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.060]   What's an island?
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.060]   Great gardens
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.060]   And it's a movie
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.060]   Quite popular as...
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.060]   Quite popular as Jolyse had with it
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.060]   Is it a grey garden?
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.060]   It's a classic documentary
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.060]   It's more sad than camp
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.060]   How would you...
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.060]   Sad camp?
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060]   Well, that's the...
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]   It isn't camp
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.060]   Aaron, is it worth watching?
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.060]   No, he couldn't handle it
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.060]   I love it
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.060]   The males has made it
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.060]   You know, Albert and David males
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.060]   who later made...
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.060]   Odd Man Out was six man out
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.060]   The...
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   Anyway, the documentary
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060]   The 1975 documentary
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.060]   The 1975 documentary
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.060]   The 1975 documentary
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.060]   We're off the tracks
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.060]   We're off the re-dereal
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.060]   The show
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.060]   We're off
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.060]   Great
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.060]   Little Edie and Big Edie
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060]   This week in movies
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.060]   And Little Edie was the most awkward one
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.060]   Because she would wear those scarf costumes
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.060]   Yeah, she wore...
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.060]   Pan-yhose as...
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.060]   As head-deer
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   Hey jobs, it was interesting
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.060]   So back to tech news
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.060]   Okay
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   Is there any stories this week?
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.060]   Or are we all okay?
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   You know, everybody did earnings this week
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.060]   And I found it so thrilling
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.060]   We did the Microsoft earnings
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.060]   Everybody did earnings
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.060]   Any other big stories
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.060]   And earnings?
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.060]   Not really interesting to an audience
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.060]   You know what's interesting
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.060]   It is when you lose a billion dollars
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.060]   That's interesting
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.060]   Yahoo!
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.060]   Everyone said it was disappointing earnings
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.060]   But their stocks somehow still went up
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.060]   7% for the week
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.060]   I think that this is a huge statement
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   about Marissa Meyer's success
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.060]   A lot of trust in Marissa
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.060]   I agree
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.060]   It's funny how investors
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.060]   They don't even care about the numbers
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.060]   My prediction
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.060]   Short-lived
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.060]   She is implementing the worst kind of
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.060]   stack ranking of any company
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.060]   that I know of
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.060]   So this is a hot button
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.060]   John and I have talked about this
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.060]   on other tweets before
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.060]   This is a way
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.060]   Companies General Electric
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.060]   used to do it
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.060]   Determine employee
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.060]   It's instead of performance reviews
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.060]   They do stack ranking
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.060]   Yeah
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.060]   And this PIRI is doing it
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.060]   To an extent
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   What is she doing?
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.060]   She's doing it quarterly
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.060]   She is doing it
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.060]   That's what we do
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.060]   That's what we do at Google
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.060]   You guys are doing stack ranking
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   What we do at peer reviews
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   It's peer reviews
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   But that's what stack ranking is
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.060]   No
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.060]   The bottom guy gets fired
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.060]   Oh yeah we don't do stack ranking
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.060]   It's a little different
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.060]   We can do peer reviews on a weekly basis
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.060]   It's like survivor
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.060]   But you have to fire some guy
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.060]   Every quarter you're firing your team
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.060]   So you have a team of eight, nine people
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.060]   Are they actually firing the bottom guy?
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.060]   That would make for great television
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.060]   I would watch the crap out of that
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.060]   Maybe that's her new revenue team
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.060]   That's a brilliant idea actually
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.060]   You are off the Yahoo Island
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.060]   I like this as a TV show
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.060]   Yahoo Island sounds crazy
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.060]   We can get home and we can do this
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.060]   We can have a good time with the Yahoo
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.060]   Community Netflix show
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   It'll be some other company of course
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.060]   So we were mentioning
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   Defcon Black Hat coming up at the end of the
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   End of August
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.060]   Why did you not go?
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.060]   You used to be the dark tipper
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   Whatever happened to that?
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   It was a dark tipper
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060]   Kevin was the dark tipper
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060]   It was my tech tipper
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.060]   Paul Block decided to make you the dark tipper
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.060]   I did a lot of the hacking stuff
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.060]   Doesn't mean it looked like a dark tipper
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060]   It's fun
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.060]   I just feel that like
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.060]   It's a commitment to go to Vegas
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.060]   It is
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.060]   17 degrees
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.060]   I'll read about it online
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.060]   I feel like most of the conferences now
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.060]   I just read about online or watch it streaming
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.060]   You don't need to go to Vegas
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.060]   CES I wonder why these shows even
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.060]   They're over covered
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   There's four reporters for every booth
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   CES
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.060]   I decided to stop covering CES
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.060]   when Spike was there for the week
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.060]   Spike TV
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.060]   You know
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.060]   Spike TV is covering CES
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.060]   I think it's done for Twit
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.060]   We went and we set a small team
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.060]   But we had spent $200,000 a year before
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.060]   That's a lot of money for a small company
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.060]   It was to cover
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:39.060]   CES
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.060]   It was cool though
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.060]   You had a big booth
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.060]   With a booth
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.060]   You know what? It was a tech TV thing
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.060]   It was like I wanted to redo what tech TV had done with the conduct
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.060]   Do it better
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.060]   If you wanted to do it better
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.060]   I did
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.060]   Yeah you did actually
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.060]   SIM cards have been hacked
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.060]   The flaw could affect
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.060]   Not every phone but about one in eight
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.060]   Which was a lot of phones
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.060]   Millions of phones
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.060]   We don't know what the hack is
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.060]   Because German cryptographer
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.060]   Karsten Knoll will reveal it
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.060]   At Black Hat
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   Which is July 31st
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.060]   He says it's the first hack of its kind in decades
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.060]   He and his team tested close to 1000 SIM cards for vulnerabilities
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.060]   Exploited by
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.060]   Get this
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.060]   Had it sending a hidden SMS
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.060]   So
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.060]   The two part flaw
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.060]   Which is based on an old security standard
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.060]   And badly configured code could allow hackers
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.060]   To infect your SIM with a virus via text message
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.060]   And then do things like
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.060]   Drain your mobile phone bill by sending premium text messages
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.060]   Or surreptitiously redirect and record calls
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   Carry out payment system fraud
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.060]   It's a fairly serious bug
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.060]   We don't know what the details are
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.060]   Because you don't find out until he reveals it
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.060]   The real issue is not so much a problem here
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.060]   I think in the US
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.060]   But in areas where
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.060]   Like Africa where SIM cards are
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.060]   The way people pay
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060]   Stuff they do you know
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060]   Phone payments, SIM card and base payments
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.060]   Are how
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.060]   What's a
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.060]   Africa is huge
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.060]   It's huge
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.060]   I can't remember the name there
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.060]   How sad that you would want to
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060]   Hack people in developing areas
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.060]   Tell me in the chat room know the name of this
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.060]   Go where the money is right
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060]   I don't think people who do this
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.060]   Have much of a conscience
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.060]   To be honest
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.060]   They're like opposite of
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.060]   Robinhood
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.060]   They're mostly in the Ukraine
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.060]   M-Pesa that's it M-Pesa
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   Yeah
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060]   Yeah
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.060]   Huge
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   The only thing about the description
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.060]   And that story is that
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   It seems to not affect all SIM cards
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.060]   Right
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.060]   And that he says you can't predict
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.060]   Which SIM cards actually have the flaw
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.060]   That it's almost random
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   Which I found odd
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   I'm not sure why that would be the case
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060]   That doesn't make sense
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   It sounds like the carriers perhaps
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.060]   If not all done a uniformly good job
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.060]   Of fixing this flaw
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.060]   Might would be my case
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.060]   Or that they may have
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.060]   Old SIM cards in stock
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   And they just continue to use it
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.060]   Ahh
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.060]   Right
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.060]   That's possible
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.060]   Unknown
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.060]   The market for SIMs
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:56.060]   Ahh
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.060]   They're really they're two companies
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.060]   Gemalto and Oberthur Technologies
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.060]   That make most SIM cards
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.060]   There are five billion SIM cards
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.060]   In use right now
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.060]   And they estimate about one in eight
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.060]   Would be vulnerable
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:14.060]   And it's you know we don't know
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.060]   You watch these with interest
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.060]   And of course as I said
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.060]   This is the season for the next month
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.060]   We're going to hear about all kinds of hacks
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.060]   They say if it could be a software patch
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.060]   Or is it something where you have to replace the car
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.060]   Or what's the deal?
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.060]   They're not saying but I would guess
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.060]   It's a saw
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.060]   They say because of the intersection
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.060]   Of software and a flaw in the SIM
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.060]   It sounds like you could fix it in software
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.060]   You know there was a lot of attention given
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.060]   To the flaw in Android
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.060]   That allowed most like
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.060]   99% of Android phones
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.060]   To be hacked
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.060]   But Google patched that almost immediately
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.060]   The play store is scanning for the flaw
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   And many Android phones like my Samsung Galaxy S4
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.060]   Already have the fix built into it
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.060]   You know it was a patch that was downloaded a couple of months
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   Is that your new phone?
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.060]   It's just the cover makes it look like it
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.060]   May I see?
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.060]   Yes, let me just unlock it for you
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:03.060]   It's still enormous
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.060]   Love it when she says it
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.060]   How big is that?
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.060]   It's so big
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.060]   Okay, okay
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.060]   What?
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.060]   Why your phone it's enormous
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.060]   I'm surprised she doesn't slap people
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.060]   I would
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.060]   I'm saving it
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   I'm saving it for the right moment
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.060]   She's going to toss me down the stairs after you show
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.060]   Well she should
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.060]   I'm looking forward to that
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.060]   Kevin, are you just waiting for everybody to get over this raccoon thing?
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.060]   It's going to take a few months I'm sure
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.060]   You posted it dude
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.060]   That's true
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.060]   That's true
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.060]   Any second thoughts on that?
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.060]   No
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   No
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060]   This is put in it
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.060]   You know what's interesting is
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.060]   It proves your celebrity status
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060]   Because most of these articles didn't say
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.060]   Kevin Rose, comma, founder of Dig
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.060]   Or Kevin Rose, venture, Kevin Rose
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.060]   Everybody knows Kevin Rose
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.060]   And it's going to K.R. next
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.060]   K.R.
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.060]   It's going to K.R.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.060]   K.R.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.060]   K.R.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.060]   K.R.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.060]   K.R.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:53.060]   There it is
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.060]   K.R.s
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.060]   Rose raccoon
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.060]   What did you use to call yourself Dr.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.060]   Dr. Robert?
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.060]   Dr. Robert
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.060]   You didn't ever call yourself that?
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.060]   I don't think so
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   Isn't that your middle name?
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.060]   That's about middle song
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060]   Your first name?
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   R.K. Rose
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.060]   What are you looking at?
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.060]   I just didn't do anything
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.060]   And it put Robert into the search engine
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.060]   It's listening
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.060]   But you're a mile away from the
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.060]   Listening
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.060]   That's funny with Google glass
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.060]   If you tap it or you have it set to tilt head
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.060]   Anybody who says, "Okay glass, take a picture"
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060]   It will take a picture
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.060]   Do you have one?
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.060]   Glass?
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.060]   No, I gave it to Jay
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.060]   I got one, but I gave it to Jason
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.060]   How because he isn't baby
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   I have no interest in wearing that stupid stuff
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.060]   Do you wear, do you have glass?
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.060]   I have one for about a month
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.060]   And then I was very early prototyping
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.060]   I gave it back
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.060]   You kind of lose interest
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   It's like, "That's cool, but what am I going to do with that?"
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.060]   For me, I mean, it's just going to take some time
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.060]   For the absolute bell
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.060]   I think for it
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.060]   For developers, it's interesting
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.060]   It's the developers thing
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.060]   Aaron has one and I won't talk to him
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.060]   When he's wearing it
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.060]   I'm just so careful
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.060]   Good for you
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   Do you take it in the shower with you?
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.060]   I'm all
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.060]   No, he takes it in the shower
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.060]   The scobble thing was the worst thing ever
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.060]   That's bad PR
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.060]   That's bad PR
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.060]   That's like some scobble thing
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.060]   I did not want to see wet and half nude
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.060]   Right
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.060]   That would be scobble
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060]   I love scobble, God bless him
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.060]   He's a great guy
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.060]   I don't want to see him in the shower with Google glass on
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.060]   Like, I just, this is not
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.060]   It's like when Snooky carries a Gucci bag
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.060]   It's like, okay, never need to buy that
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060]   Snooky
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.060]   Oh, he's a glassy gentleman over here
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   I like that, yes, it's great
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.060]   I seriously have no idea
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.060]   He's a trashy human being
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.060]   It's just a real
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.060]   I heard that we heard that like
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.060]   a handbag maker would send a competitor's handbag
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.060]   for her to carry around
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.060]   You're a smart
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.060]   Yeah, yeah, so that would be the glass
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   And now I think
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.060]   I think everyone should not
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.060]   When somebody's wearing those glasses
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.060]   and they start talking to you
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.060]   You should say
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.060]   "Take those glasses off and I'll respond
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.060]   Otherwise, I'm not saying anything"
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.060]   Who cares?
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.060]   Take all the pictures you want
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.060]   I don't want it to be taken
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.060]   Take a picture
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.060]   It'll last long, I'm going to start a website
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.060]   I mean, I value my privacy
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.060]   and I don't want to be talking to four eyes
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.060]   over there when he's got those things on
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.060]   and I don't know what he's recording
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.060]   I don't know what pictures he's taking
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.060]   He's marriage last
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   More than that
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.060]   I don't know if he's listening
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.060]   I can't not even see his name
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.060]   He's just playing
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.060]   He seems to be smiling all the time
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:07.060]   I think it's probably a pretty good relationship
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.060]   So what's going to happen with Google Glass
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.060]   is it's going to, once the novelty wears off
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.060]   people will use it when they use it
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   and they'll take it off
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.060]   They'll use it to take their baby pictures
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.060]   while they're holding the baby
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   and then they'll take it off
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.060]   And people aren't going to be walking around
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   with it all the time
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   except for real weirdos
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   Well, I think like doctors and nurses
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.060]   especially in remote areas
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:29.060]   will probably be using it more than people with babies
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:31.060]   People with babies can't crazy, though
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.060]   It'll be a niche item
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.060]   Yeah, it'll be like a GoPro
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.060]   kind of, like where you use it at certain times
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.060]   when you're biking
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.060]   or you do something crazy
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   Yeah, you don't get a worse one
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.060]   You get all the time
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.060]   Like Justin used to do
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.060]   Yeah, right
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.060]   All of that is true
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.060]   and yet I do think wearable computing
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:48.060]   is the next big thing
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:49.060]   Yeah, I think not
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.060]   I don't know if it's glass
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060]   I don't know if it's watch
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.060]   I don't know if it's
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.060]   a little thing embedded in my shirt
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.060]   But don't you think the computer
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.060]   having it always on, always listening,
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.060]   always watching is wonderful idea
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.060]   I hate that
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.060]   Oh God, I hate
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.060]   There's not rumors
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.060]   The next Google phone, the Moto X
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.060]   which Kevin does not have
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.060]   I don't get it either
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.060]   It's not my pocket right now
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.060]   Not this far
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.060]   If you can't bring a Moto X with him
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.060]   The rumor is it's always on
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.060]   that it's always listening
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.060]   and if you say whatever the key phrase is
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.060]   "Okay Google" or "Okay Moto Role X"
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.060]   it will say yes
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.060]   So like you just sit there
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.060]   because you swiped up
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.060]   Yeah, and the next thing you know
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.060]   is just listening in
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.060]   Right, but if what if you didn't have to swipe up
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.060]   what if it's in your pocket
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.060]   and you say "Hey Glass"
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.060]   That's a nightmare
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.060]   It is a nightmare
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.060]   If you look at Prism
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   and the data that we're collecting
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.060]   and then you say "Oh, I just want to have something that's always on that knows everything that it is"
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.060]   This is a terrible idea
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.060]   When you combine these two things
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.060]   it's a hellscape
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.060]   She's old school
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.060]   Most kids don't care
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.060]   What if it's not sending it to the NSA
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.060]   It's just listening all the time
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.060]   I think and then when you say the key word
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.060]   then it starts
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.060]   It's still creepy
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.060]   Don't worry about that
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.060]   I mean think about like how much of a pain
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.060]   in the ass ass dialing was
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.060]   Remember back in the day
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.060]   you'd sit on like the keys
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.060]   and it would call someone
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.060]   Now all you have to do is talk
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.060]   and all of a sudden your phone's doing crazy stuff
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.060]   So you don't like that idea either
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.060]   Can you imagine
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.060]   Imagine you say "Okay Glass"
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.060]   while you're having an intimate moment with your significant other
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.060]   because that happens right?
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.060]   Okay Glass, call my ex wife
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.060]   Whoops
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.060]   She's your ex now
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.060]   Ohhh
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.060]   Okay
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.060]   So Android Police has a story on the Moto X
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:32.060]   and it's indicating that it does indeed have this always listening feature
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.060]   but it's off by default
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.060]   You have to turn it on in order to activate it
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:38.060]   So it's not going to come out of the box
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.060]   I would imagine
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.060]   I mean I'd be surprised if it weren't that way
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.060]   I mean you have to do that
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.060]   Yeah
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.060]   But I want it because
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.060]   This phone sucks by the way
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.060]   Why?
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   He's looking at my Galaxy S4
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.060]   Why?
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:56.060]   It's some abortion version of Android
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.060]   and so things launch funny
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.060]   Everything about it is uncomfortable
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.060]   Do you use an ex's for?
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.060]   Yeah
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.060]   Yeah
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.060]   Check out the camera app
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.060]   On this thing?
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.060]   Yeah
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.060]   Alright I'll push that
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.060]   That's the worst example of Motorola CRUD
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.060]   because it's got 18 different features
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.060]   You mean Samsung CRUD?
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.060]   Yeah what did I say?
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.060]   Yeah Samsung
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.060]   I'm getting some still lights here
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.060]   You take a photo
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:23.060]   Quick!
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.060]   That's that!
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.060]   Please turn that!
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.060]   Wait, wait, wait
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.060]   That's the picture
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.060]   Kevin likes raccoons after all
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.060]   I want a t-shirt with that
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.060]   Alright chatroom
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.060]   Caption contest
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.060]   You got the picture
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.060]   Now let's see what you can do
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.060]   Before the end of the show
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.060]   I know you all got that
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.060]   Before the end
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.060]   Yeah I agree with
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.060]   I think carrier customization
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.060]   Suck
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.060]   It's one of the reasons I think
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.060]   Moto X will be interesting
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.060]   because it's the first
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.060]   Motorola phone since Google
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.060]   Acquired him
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.060]   Now I think Motorola has
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.060]   announcements on the 24th
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.060]   but I think it's the old
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.060]   The like the last of the droids
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.060]   It's declaring up the life one
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.060]   Can't even change the first
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.060]   August 1st is the Moto X
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.060]   Yeah August 1st is Moto X
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.060]   August 24th is the breakfast
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.060]   with the Android
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.060]   With Sundar Pachai
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.060]   I'm looking forward to that
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.060]   Of course, I wouldn't miss it
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   What do you think?
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060]   What do you think?
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.060]   What do you...
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.060]   Tickle fights all around
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.060]   I don't know
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.060]   I haven't the foggiest
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.060]   I think they can't
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.060]   Tickle fight with Sundar Pachai
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:22.060]   Sounds like something to enjoy
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.060]   He's kind of a...
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.060]   What?
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.060]   That rim
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.060]   He's very serious
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.060]   You want your business
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.060]   executives to be
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.060]   Sundar is now
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.060]   Was the guy with the chrome guy
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.060]   He's now Android and Chrome
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.060]   So the question is
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.060]   Is it Android?
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.060]   Is it Chrome?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.060]   Is it both?
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060]   What is it?
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   Oh you can't...
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.060]   Okay, it is going to be Android
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.060]   It is not going to be
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.060]   It's Android and I...
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.060]   Yeah, okay
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.060]   Well I think you can't have
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.060]   Android and Chrome together
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.060]   Like that just doesn't work
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.060]   Right
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.060]   It's a different...
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.060]   Well I use Chrome on Android
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.060]   Well you can use Chrome on Android
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.060]   But Android is an operating
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.060]   It's not Chrome OS
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.060]   Chrome OS isn't an OS
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.060]   It's a damn browser
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.060]   Pardon my language
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.060]   It's an OS
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.060]   It's just a very limited OS
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.060]   It's not an OS
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.060]   I agree with her
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.060]   It doesn't access the disk drive
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.060]   and do all kinds of fancy stuff
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.060]   If you can't install software or applications
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.060]   It's not an operating system
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.060]   Well you can install extensions
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.060]   Extensions
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.060]   It's not the same
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.060]   Well I know it's not the same
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.060]   But it is installing applications
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.060]   Can you install photo?
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.060]   I'm with her
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.060]   No but you can install...
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.060]   It's not an application
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.060]   You can install AV area
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.060]   You don't really like from this
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.060]   You don't like from this
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.060]   It's a web page that's browser
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:23.060]   It's a thing from OS
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.060]   But it is an OS
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.060]   It's Linux
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.060]   That Linux is the OS
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.060]   Chrome
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.060]   It's a stepped down version of the OS
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:33.060]   But that's like saying OS X is Unix
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.060]   It's not really
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.060]   It is an OS
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.060]   When I open the terminal
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.060]   I got units
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.060]   No I know it is
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.060]   She's saying that Chrome OS isn't
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.060]   An OS
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.060]   You're agreeing with me or her
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.060]   I don't know
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.060]   I'm going to cause it at this point
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.060]   I would agree with the one who brought muffins
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   Yeah
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.060]   I don't think that's your problem
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.060]   I think you're moving
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.060]   I would like her
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.060]   You're marginalizing her opinion
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.060]   It's not bad
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.060]   If that's why I bring it
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.060]   If you've got the cake
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.060]   You're always right
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.060]   That's why he puts the
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.060]   Apple is buying
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.060]   Hopstop
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.060]   What?
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:07.060]   It is a mass transit app
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.060]   This is one advantage
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.060]   Google really has with Google Maps
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.060]   It's just Google Maps
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.060]   Google Maps has deteriorated
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   to an extreme by the way
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.060]   You don't like the new one?
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.060]   Seven out?
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.060]   I haven't gone to Seven out yet
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.060]   Seven out just came out
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.060]   I love it
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.060]   They did make it simpler
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   For instance
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.060]   I don't see as much detail in the map
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.060]   I'm telling you, there was something going on
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.060]   About these maps
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   Because they were much better like six to nine months
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.060]   They lost the license to whatever it is
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   For something, but they won't talk about it
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:42.060]   I've tried to talk to the public relations department
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.060]   Press at Google
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.060]   And they refused to even answer a question about this
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.060]   Oh, really?
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.060]   Yeah
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.060]   No, that was genuine
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.060]   I'm sorry, I sounded sarcastic
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.060]   But no, they should talk to you
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.060]   I like Google Maps
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:59.060]   And one of the things Google has done is they
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:02.060]   Are aggregating public transit information from city governments
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:05.060]   It's interesting because some city governments
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.060]   Have locked it down
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.060]   Saying you can't have it
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   We want to have our own app
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.060]   Which I think is not what city governments should be doing with that data
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:16.060]   But apparently, Apple, which has lost its transit instructions
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.060]   And the Apple Maps doesn't have it
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.060]   When they got rid of Google Maps
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.060]   Have acquired Hopstop
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.060]   They offer walking, taxi, and bicycle directions
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.060]   As well as mass transit directions
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.060]   So that's something that will be, I guess, back in maps
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.060]   As soon as this acquisition had it
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.060]   I didn't have it on my Windows phone
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.060]   No, this is Google Maps
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.060]   Oh, on Windows?
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.060]   Oh, you did it from the website
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.060]   You downloaded it
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.060]   It's an app on the Google store
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.060]   What?
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.060]   Yes
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.060]   Yes
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.060]   Yes
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.060]   This is my Google
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.060]   You have Google Places
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.060]   Yeah
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.060]   Is it a Google app?
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.060]   It's a Google app for the Windows phone
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   Oh, I didn't know they made it for the Windows phone
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   I didn't either and then I was like, "Woo! Don't have to use the name of it"
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   Well, download the here stuff, too, from Nokia
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.060]   That's quite good, Nokia has excellent maps as well
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   This is an HTC, so
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.060]   I don't know about that
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   You can still download it
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.060]   I can?
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.060]   Yeah
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.060]   I don't want to, I just want to use Google Maps
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.060]   I played with those in Nokia
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.060]   You don't like to hear stuff?
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:15.060]   No, well, maybe I haven't done it for a year
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.060]   Well, no, yeah, I think it's...
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.060]   Waze is another one out there
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060]   I love Waze
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060]   I hate Waze
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060]   Waze is great
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.060]   Oh, everybody loves Waze
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   I can't handle it
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.060]   I'm with Jolie again
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   And here's the reason
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:30.060]   It's essentially a distraction for a driver to play with Waze
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.060]   If you have a Navigator, yeah, it's the best because they can be punch and stuff
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.060]   Well, I agree with you, it's risky, but all maps apps are distracted
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.060]   Yeah, but this is really distracting because they've got little bubbles and you're supposed to respond
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.060]   Oh, there's a cop there, let me write it in
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:45.060]   You pull it to the side of the road or maybe you pull off into the wrong lane, you get killed
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.060]   I'm telling you, this is the most dangerous product out there
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.060]   It won't let you win it if you're the driver
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.060]   It says, yeah, it's like the price of a business
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.060]   Yeah, it says, it sounds pretty bad
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.060]   Yeah, worse than prism
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:03.060]   Waze, that's the real enemy we should be fighting, there's Waze
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:09.060]   I do like the Waze, the one thing I like about Waze is the gas station, the app, which is within the product
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:14.060]   You click on the little bubble and it shows you all the nearby gas stations, which saved me on some recent trip, by the way
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:21.060]   But you find all the nearby gas stations can get instructions to them, but it shows you the best prices within about five miles of where you are
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.060]   And it's updated constantly
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:29.060]   There's also a great app called the Road Ahead, which I think, it's on iOS, I don't know if it's on Android
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:34.060]   That does the same thing, it shows you at each exit up ahead of you
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:39.060]   What is there, and you can use it to find restaurants and gas stations, it has their prices
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:42.060]   It jumps off to gas buddy for the prices
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.060]   But it's a great app for a log road trip
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   Vision Mobile Polls, 6,000 mobile developers, who makes the most money, what platforms are their favorites, will tell you in just a moment
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:22:00.060]   You're watching Twit with John C. Devorak, channeleddevorak.com, and noagendashow.com, Jolio Del from Venture Beat
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:07.060]   Kevin Rose, my old friend from the screens of the, the dark tip, or from the screensavers, Dig, Milk, and now
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:12.060]   I should also plug a new domain, which I'm going to be doing some more work for
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:15.060]   We'll talk about a new domain as well, Gina Smith's Center Prize
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.060]   You know she moved to Oklahoma
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.060]   What?
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.060]   You know, nobody knows Oklahoma
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.060]   What?
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.060]   Oklahoma, she's a neighbor
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.060]   She moved to Oklahoma?
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.060]   Yeah, last time I talked to her, she was thinking of moving to Petaluma
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.060]   She moved to Oklahoma?
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:34.060]   Yeah, you know she has a son who's destined to be like an NBA superstar center
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.060]   Eric is very tall
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.060]   He's very tall, he's going to be, they predict seven foot easy
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060]   Wow
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   He's got an old, one of the scouts for the Golden State Warriors is coaching him
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.060]   Oh, so he wants to be a sooner, he thinks this is his best shot at the NBA
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.060]   He's going to a school because he's also apparently a world-class opera singer
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.060]   I mean, this is the goldmine
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:00.060]   I think he is making this, no, no, no, she's an opera singer and basketball player
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.060]   In fact, she was at an opera, she was where he's singing
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.060]   Apparently he's this unbelievable singer, he's going to be at such a star in the NBA
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.060]   Because of these little idiosyncrasies, because it would get a lot of publicity
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:14.060]   That she won't have to pay anything for college, nothing
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.060]   Well good for her
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.060]   This opera school's in Oklahoma?
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.060]   No, no, he was in a play, an opera in Oklahoma
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.060]   Oh, last week, and that's where she was
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.060]   But she moved there
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.060]   No, I'm not, and people think I'm dissing Oklahoma, I'm not, I'm just surprised
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:30.060]   I thought last I heard she was in San Francisco thinking of moving to Petaluma
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.060]   Well
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.060]   Maybe she thought Petaluma in Oklahoma
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.060]   Maybe I misunderstood
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:39.060]   Anyway, Kevin is now a venture capitalist with Google Ventures, one of the partners there
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.060]   Yep
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:46.060]   Good gig, you get to see all the new stuff, do you get the people from the Google projects, the X project
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.060]   Come over and show you stuff and things like stuff?
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.060]   Oh man, it's fun
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:53.060]   It's cool, anything you can tell us about, like the rocket ship
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.060]   Did they build it?
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.060]   Nope
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.060]   Okay
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.060]   I do have a good rumor though on from Samsung
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.060]   Okay, so hold on
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.060]   Kevin's been great on this stuff, you nailed that
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.060]   You're a bunch of Apple rumors last year
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:10.060]   Also with his Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle blog.com/techblog
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:13.060]   He also is the host of Reality Bites
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.060]   Technology Bites
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.060]   Technology Bites
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.060]   And we just celebrated our 18th year, we've been on the year for 18 years
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060]   What?
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060]   Not least
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060]   I've been with it for 18 years
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060]   That's all long, so it's good
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.060]   Yep, I would say the longest continually running
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.060]   Yeah
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.060]   I have been doing tech talk radius since '91, so longer than that
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:36.060]   But it was not continuous, I stopped during the tech TV era
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:40.060]   And it was on different channels, you know, I kept moving around
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.060]   So, oh yeah, I would say, if that show's been on the same
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.060]   Was it K?
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:54.060]   It's Pacifica, right?
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.060]   Well, that would be K P F A
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.060]   No, there's another one, I don't know if it's K P F A
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.060]   It's in California somewhere
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.060]   Okay, well good, I'll look for technology Bites
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.060]   Wednesday night at eight
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.060]   Our show brought to you by our friends at Citrix
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.060]   We're going to do the great go-to meeting
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:15.060]   Summertime is a tough time to get people together
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:19.060]   For meetings, everybody's on vacation, moving around, traveling
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.060]   Of course, nowadays with the offices all over the place
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.060]   Kevin's in San Francisco, his teams in Mountain View
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.060]   It's hard
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:29.060]   But with go to meeting, you can have meetings with anybody anywhere, anytime
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:33.060]   And with HD faces, you actually see them in Crystal Career Clear HD video
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.060]   You can see the screen
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:38.060]   So you're on the same page, you're seeing them eye to eye
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.060]   Meetings are, as much as I hate to admit it, they are the way to cut through
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:48.060]   The clutter, the confusion, to make plans to brainstorm, to be creative
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.060]   Meetings do get the job done
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:55.060]   And with go to meeting, you can make sure those meetings are as efficient and as easy as possible
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.060]   I want you to visit go-to-meeting.com

[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.060]   Which is pretty awesome
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.060]   Using the iPads camera, they can see you using the iPads microphone and headphones
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.060]   You can hear them, you can talk to them
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:19.060]   It's, you know, you can be out in the, out in the, by the pool, attending a meeting

[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.060]   Alright, I think we should start with the Samsung rumor
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.060]   What do you hear, what do you know?
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.060]   Well, I hear about these wearable devices that watch
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.060]   And I hear about the same, I heard a little rumor about Samsung's launch
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.060]   Samsung's supposed to have one, Apple's supposed to have one
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.060]   Microsoft says we have a watch again
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:50.060]   You have the Samsung watch, what I thought was interesting about this rumor
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.060]   Is that they said it actually has a camera built into it
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.060]   That points out like this way
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.060]   Oh, that won't be out of the way
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.060]   So you could look like this?
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.060]   You can go and take pictures like this
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.060]   I think that's pretty good
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.060]   That was a rumor
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:04.060]   That's natural
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.060]   I'm a fan-rate, I heard that rumor as well
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.060]   You're like Inspector Gadget
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.060]   Yeah
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:11.060]   Smile
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060]   Or I'll play too
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.060]   Like it looks weird
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.060]   It looks like Dick Tracy
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.060]   Yeah, that'll play well on radio too
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   I'm sincere when I say I think wearable computing
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.060]   Absolutely is the next big thing
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060]   It's a challenge though
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.060]   Glasses aren't quite right because they're very visible and they're nerdy
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.060]   And not everybody wants to wear glasses
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.060]   A wristwatch isn't quite right either
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.060]   I mean really a smartphone is not so bad
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.060]   I mean that is a good display now
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.060]   This is a 1080p display
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.060]   Well that's if you need a computer
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.060]   Wearable computing could be a lot of things
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.060]   It could be a sensor
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.060]   It could accomplish one task instead of 50
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.060]   I think if you want a computer
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.060]   You certainly don't want one on your wrist
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.060]   In front of your face
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.060]   I would take sensors
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.060]   I think it's all of that
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:58.060]   So I think maybe there is a computer in your pocket
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:00.060]   That's how Google Glass works
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.060]   And if you wanted to do the glass
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.060]   The glass isn't a computer by itself
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.060]   A watch probably wouldn't be either
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.060]   See I wouldn't want a watch
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.060]   I think if it's something that Apple's going to come out with
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.060]   It's going to be like flexible OLED technology
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.060]   That goes around like a display that wraps
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.060]   Something that's a little bit like
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.060]   Who wants a watch in your pocket?
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.060]   It's more like a slave bracelet
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.060]   I agree with Kevin I'm not a slave bracelet
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.060]   Maybe a flat bracelet
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.060]   You've got to watch a pocket bracelet
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   A pocket watch is called phone
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060]   I hate when they call it a watch
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.060]   Who's wearing a watch in our audience?
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.060]   A wristwatch?
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   Three, four, five people
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.060]   Aaron is
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.060]   There's six people in
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:37.060]   Bam!
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.060]   Aaron you wear a wristwatch?
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.060]   Look, look!
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.060]   Why do you wear a wristwatch?
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.060]   White's got one
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.060]   Why do I wear a wristwatch?
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.060]   Because you want to look at your time
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.060]   You don't want to look at the phone
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.060]   You want to look at me
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.060]   I'm a fancy billionaire with a big old watch
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.060]   You guys have had this?
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.060]   You guys have had this?
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.060]   I'm going to move.
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.060]   I'll give it to her next time
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:57.060]   Do you want to say to Dariah right now?
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.060]   Hey man
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.060]   We're about that raccoon
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.060]   I killed him right?
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.060]   That's right
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.060]   I got some points for that right?
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.060]   I'm a kind of a man, huh?
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.060]   Look at that, there we go
[01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:09.060]   I'm not crazy, I'm eccentric
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:11.060]   Thanks Google money
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.060]   There's one caption to go with a raccoon
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.060]   No, no, no, no
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.060]   You can do better than that
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060]   Keep working
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.060]   Keep digging
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.060]   Something about a raccoon
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.060]   Slave braces, a good word
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.060]   I agree sensors in the clothes
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.060]   And in the wrist
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.060]   We both were the flexed
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.060]   I've done the jawbone
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.060]   Which is awesome
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.060]   You turned me on to the Fitbit
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.060]   I remember when it came out
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.060]   But like six months before it came out
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.060]   You said this is going to be cool
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.060]   And I love it
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.060]   And people with health problems
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.060]   Sensors can be life savers
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.060]   Exactly
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.060]   If you need to have contact with your doctor
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.060]   Kind of around the top
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.060]   I've fallen and I can't get up
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.060]   Remember that?
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.060]   I'm getting a hold of a doctor
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.060]   Not just people in ill health
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   In general, I think biomed
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.060]   You must be looking at this
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:56.060]   I'm maybe not you, but somebody at Google
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.060]   Has got to be looking at the idea
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.060]   Google X, they're making a lot of hardware
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.060]   Over there
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.060]   Biomedical sensors
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060]   It could sense blood oxygen
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.060]   Could take gas readings
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.060]   Could take pressure
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.060]   It's coming a lot of stuff
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:10.060]   I would think so
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.060]   I would like that
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.060]   Because I'm almost dead
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.060]   And I think it would be really good
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.060]   I think it would be really good
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.060]   I don't know about that
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.060]   I don't know about that
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.060]   She's a diabetic
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.060]   And she has to show
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.060]   A problem
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.060]   She has to poke herself
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.060]   She does, it's painful
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:23.060]   She has calluses on her poor face
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.060]   Why would you do that to my mother?
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:27.060]   Yeah, John
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.060]   What's wrong with you and Erin?
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.060]   All men
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.060]   If I could get her on my side
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.060]   Maybe I'll get more muffin
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.060]   Seems unlike her
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.060]   Wow
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:41.060]   This is kind of in you when
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.060]   No, it's outrageous
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.060]   Outrageous
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.060]   She's stop bringing buns
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:47.060]   She's stop bringing buns
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.060]   Because she knew that I would really get
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.060]   Myeliged at this
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.060]   But that doesn't matter
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:52.060]   Any big good will work
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.060]   6,000
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.060]   Go ahead, yes
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.060]   There's your show title
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.060]   Any baked good will do
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   Any baked good in the storm?
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.060]   Or muffin
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.060]   Or muffin is your show
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.060]   Vision mobile
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.060]   Surveyed
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.060]   6,000 mobile developers
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.060]   I actually be interested
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.060]   What do you think of this
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.060]   Survey Kevin?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.060]   They said that
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.060]   Android is the most popular
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.060]   But iOS is the most profitable
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.060]   What kind of company is doing the survey?
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.060]   Survey company
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.060]   I don't know
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.060]   They're called Vision Mobile
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.060]   I don't know their name
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.060]   I know what you say
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:26.060]   I know what you say
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.060]   Yeah, you look at it's
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:28.060]   In Venture Beat
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.060]   It's a suspect
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.060]   Well, I, okay, here's the
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.060]   But you're right, I mean these
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.060]   Survey's one
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.060]   No, this is iPhone versus
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.060]   Android bull crap
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.060]   It depends on who's asking on which
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.060]   day it goes back and forth
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.060]   All the time, iOS makes
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.060]   Myeliged at this point
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.060]   But this is a large sample size
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.060]   100,000 is not large
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   For developers it is
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.060]   115 countries
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.060]   iOS developers making an
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.060]   average of $5,200 a month
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.060]   That's a lot in app revenue
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:53.060]   Android 4700
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.060]   I think a lot of people think
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.060]   That there's no money in Android
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.060]   So the difference is like
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.060]   That's the difference?
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.060]   500 bucks
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   And more developers plan to
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.060]   Start developing for Windows
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.060]   Phone than any other platform
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:07.060]   Oh bull, now we know it's
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.060]   Oh, it's sponsored by Microsoft
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.060]   No, does it say that?
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.060]   No, it doesn't
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.060]   It will
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.060]   If you dig deep enough
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.060]   Well, they're clients
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:16.060]   To include Microsoft and Nokia
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.060]   So I'm sure that they would say
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.060]   Something like that
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.060]   The average developer builds
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.060]   For 2.9 ecosystems simultaneously
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.060]   What?
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.060]   That doesn't sound right
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   That doesn't sound right
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.060]   That sounds like
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:28.060]   That sounds like drag
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.060]   That's down from 2011
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.060]   In which they build for 3.2
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.060]   Ecosystems, Blackberry
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   Probably the loser there
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060]   What do you think about Blackberry?
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.060]   The sole developer or developer
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.060]   Is there a shot at Blackberry?
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:38.060]   If they go Android, yeah
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.060]   Android instead of Blackberry
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.060]   You mean dump it
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.060]   Dump it all
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.060]   Build your apps for Android
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.060]   And run Android
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.060]   Alright, so then it would be
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.060]   No
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:48.060]   Because that's hopeless
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.060]   Because even HTC, which is making
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.060]   Great Android hardware
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.060]   Is having a very hard time
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.060]   Sure, but they also have a lot of
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:54.060]   Professional apps that could run
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.060]   On top of that
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.060]   So keep Enterprise server running
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.060]   All their enterprise stuff
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:00.060]   They're keyboard that everyone loves
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.060]   Like all the stuff that they do
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   Well, their messenger charge for that
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:05.060]   And run that as an enterprise
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.060]   They're doing cross-platform
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.060]   BBM
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.060]   Right
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060]   Maybe that's a sign
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   Well, you know, people have said
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.060]   That about Nokia, too
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.060]   Why isn't Nokia just go Android?
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.060]   That's what I've said since day one
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.060]   And knowledge that there are two
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.060]   Mobile operating systems and two only
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.060]   Well, they're making a very specific bet
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.060]   And I think that when you are trying to
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.060]   Resurrect a piece of hardware
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.060]   That hasn't been popular in the US for quite some time
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:29.060]   Like when are you talking about?
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.060]   No, Nokia
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.060]   Nokia, Nokia
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.060]   Nokia, Nokia, Nokia
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:34.060]   Which one do we say?
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.060]   It doesn't matter
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.060]   Nokia, Nokia, Nokia
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.060]   I think you have to make a big bet
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.060]   And really focus on something that will delight consumers
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.060]   And Android, I've used it for years
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:43.060]   And it has ceased to be delightful
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.060]   I don't think anybody says Android is delightful
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.060]   Even people like me who love Android
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:49.060]   I'm not sure I would say it's delightful
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.060]   I wouldn't even call the iPhone delightful
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.060]   I think it's been
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.060]   iPhone's far from delightful
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.060]   It's antiquated at this point
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.060]   I know, I'm so surprised that iOS 7 didn't keep pace
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.060]   With what other mobile operating systems are doing
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.060]   You're an aesthetic person
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.060]   I do like it
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.060]   You've got a dog dressed in a teal polo shirt
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.060]   Yeah, he's rowing it
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:09.060]   Yeah, red f-word dogs
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.060]   That's how it's called
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.060]   That's how it's called
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.060]   That's why he's so sedated
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.060]   What do you think of iOS 7?
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.060]   Me?
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.060]   Now it looks
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.060]   Nice to see dogs
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:20.060]   So it's somewhere between
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:23.060]   Hipster 2010
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:26.060]   And iPhone 2007
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.060]   It's got...
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.060]   I'm not crazy about it
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.060]   But he has and he does a lot
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.060]   Which is the word amazing
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.060]   I love that
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.060]   I love that
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.060]   I find it amazing
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.060]   I love it
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:49.060]   Everyone uses kind of like a
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.060]   Cleashank breathtaking as well
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.060]   Oh, that's like a taker of breath
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.060]   That's different
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:55.060]   That's something I use
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.060]   I use a stunning thing
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.060]   That's stunning
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.060]   Just don't say a mace balls
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.060]   Please
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.060]   How about mind-boggling?
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:04.060]   Mind-boggling is not a good one
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.060]   That's not overused
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.060]   I'm nobody using that
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:08.060]   I'm stopping from now on
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.060]   That's my...
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:10.060]   What is stopping?
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.060]   That's a candy
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:13.060]   Does that mean that it shuts you up?
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.060]   Yeah
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.060]   Your gob is...
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.060]   Your gob is stopped because
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.060]   You're so breathtaking
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.060]   Well that won't happen
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:19.060]   Thought you said something else
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.060]   Well we're all God-stop now
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.060]   It didn't take much
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.060]   I think that this is an interesting question Kevin posed
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:28.060]   Should Blackberry go Android?
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.060]   I think they considered it
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.060]   I heard it
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.060]   No, no, yes
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.060]   No, because it's Blackberry no
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.060]   I think no...
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   It's just a commodity device
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.060]   That's a...
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.060]   It's a commodity
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.060]   That's a commodity
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:38.060]   I think it's a commodity
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.060]   It's a commodity device
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:41.060]   The problem is...
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.060]   Well that's what he's saying
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:43.060]   Is that
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:45.060]   Acknowledge the commoditization of the OS
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.060]   And start to say
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   Hey, but we provide
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.060]   Better keyboards, better enterprise security
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.060]   We have a server you guys are used to using
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.060]   I played with the...
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.060]   The trajectory is too...
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.060]   The trajectory is too downward now
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.060]   Are they like...
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.060]   It's too late for them
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.060]   Is that very?
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.060]   Yeah
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.060]   No matter what they do
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.060]   It's too late for Blackberry
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.060]   It's too late for Blackberry
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.060]   It is too late
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.060]   I think you're right
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.060]   It would be...
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.060]   It's a Hail Mary
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.060]   That's what they have to do
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.060]   At the very end and they probably will
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:11.060]   Never say never
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.060]   I mean look at Yahoo
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.060]   We would have said it was over for Yahoo
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.060]   A couple years...
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.060]   It may still be over for Yahoo
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:20.060]   I think they've got some really great products out right now
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:23.060]   The problem with Yahoo is that
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.060]   Marissa has done wonderful things
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.060]   At making things beautiful
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.060]   Like their weather app is awesome
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.060]   On the iPhone
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.060]   But it's like...
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.060]   It's gorgeous
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.060]   Okay, like
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.060]   Where's the big game changer here
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.060]   Out of the revolution
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.060]   It's a business by making a great weather app
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.060]   Right, right
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.060]   What does that do for you?
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.060]   Exactly, it gets you next to your
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.060]   $10,000 a year
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.060]   Of concept for what the company is capable of
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.060]   We think of Yahoo is Stodgy.com
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:48.060]   Bullcrap to borrow a word from my colleague here
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.060]   But I think that
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.060]   I think it's in the process of reinventing itself
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:53.060]   And in the year
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.060]   I think she's done great work
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.060]   I'm excited, I agree
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.060]   She's done great work
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.060]   And with all the acquisitions that Yahoo has made
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.060]   I mean she's made what 80% of Yahoo's acquisitions
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.060]   During the company's multi-decade history
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.060]   I don't know if I would have bought Tumblr though
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.060]   It is what it is
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.060]   It's a lot of web traffic
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.060]   It's a lot of web traffic
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   But what else is it?
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.060]   Well what she bought
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.060]   It's not just lots of porn
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.060]   It's lots of porn
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.060]   It's lots of porn
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.060]   I love that porn
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.060]   Which they are desperate to
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.060]   She bought a lot of really great design talent
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.060]   A lot of mobile talent
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.060]   And I think
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.060]   We'll see the results of those acquisitions
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.060]   Over the next year
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.060]   Yeah but if you want that just by path
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.060]   If you want really good design talent
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.060]   Good mobile talent
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.060]   I don't think Dave Warren's for sale
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.060]   I don't think Dave Warren's for sale
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.060]   You know Dave, he's not for sale
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.060]   He's for sale
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.060]   Is he for sale?
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.060]   He's for a billion dollars
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.060]   He's for sale
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.060]   So you can take a lesson
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060]   You can take a lesson
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.060]   of what Yahoo's doing
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060]   From Google
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060]   Which is where she came from
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.060]   And Kevin you probably know this
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:43.060]   Google has spent the last three or four years
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.060]   Kind of putting pieces together
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.060]   And people would look at what they were doing
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.060]   And say what is that for?
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.060]   What is it?
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:50.060]   Then they had Google+
[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.060]   And Google+ is trying to pull it all together
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060]   And that's what she's doing
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.060]   She's pulling the pieces together
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.060]   And at some point
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:58.060]   There's going to be some spark
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.060]   And everything will kind of come together
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:01.060]   Like a lot of people
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:03.060]   Come together like the Terminator
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.060]   You know with the
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.060]   That's the word right analogy
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060]   That's what's going to happen
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.060]   And so that happened at Google
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:10.060]   And that's where she learned
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.060]   How to run a company
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.060]   And that's what's going to happen
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.060]   Is that at some point
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.060]   Everything will come together
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.060]   Yeah, that's what we're talking about
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.060]   A lot of wishful thinking on this show
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.060]   August 12th
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.060]   August 12th we're going to find out
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.060]   Something very exciting from
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.060]   Elon Musk
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.060]   We're going to talk about Hyperloop
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.060]   When we come back
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.060]   But first let's find out
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.060]   What's coming up in the week
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:30.060]   Ahead.

[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.060]   In fact, some people say
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.060]   It was already shipping this weekend
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.060]   Tuesday, July 23rd

[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.060]   Back to you, Leo
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.060]   Previously on Twitter, this week
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.060]   In Google
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.060]   I wonder how cheap it's going to
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.060]   Be with a marketing champion
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.060]   To be like
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.060]   Oh, he's going to blow
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:45.060]   He's going to blow
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.060]   Triagulation
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.060]   It reminds me almost like
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:49.060]   Of a Christo or some sort of
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.060]   Big public art project
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.060]   It's 1.8 miles long
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.060]   500 feet high
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.060]   25,000 LED lights
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060]   It's the biggest LED light
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.060]   Sculpture in the world
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.060]   Gizwiz
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.060]   Yes, you freeze him in the freezer
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.060]   Then you can burn somebody's hand off
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.060]   With these new
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.060]   Lightsaver Popsicles
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.060]   NSFW
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.060]   The day that I found Twitter
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.060]   Was the day I felt in love
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.060]   It had so many brilliant thoughts
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.060]   That made me say me to
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.060]   To it
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.060]   No, where did I play my iPhone?
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.060]   You know
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.060]   There are very few songs where you
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.060]   Think, oh, if only that song had
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.060]   Jello
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.060]   Jello or Jello?
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.060]   Jello, either
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   Elon Musk says he's going to tell
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.060]   You how the hyperloop's going to work
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.060]   August 12th
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.060]   Elon, a pretty amazing fellow
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.060]   Of course, this is the next
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.060]   New job
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:46.060]   People often liken him to
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.060]   What's his name?
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.060]   Iron Man, Tony Stark
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.060]   Founder of SpaceX
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.060]   Tesla Motors
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.060]   The hyperloop is
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:58.060]   What, an LA to San Francisco
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.060]   Bullet thing
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:01.060]   Bullet thing
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.060]   A cross between a rail gun
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:06.060]   The Concord and the air hockey table
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.060]   It would deliver people
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:09.060]   360 miles
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:12.060]   LA to San Francisco in 30 minutes
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:16.060]   We're supposedly building a
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.060]   Multi-billion dollar bullet train
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.060]   This is like
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.060]   30 minutes
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.060]   He's going to publish it
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:26.060]   His open source
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   You can give that away
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.060]   Because it's a multi-billion dollar
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.060]   Thing, right?
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:34.060]   It's a multi-billion dollar
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.060]   Thing, right?
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.060]   It's a multi-billion dollar
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.060]   That's not true
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.060]   That's not true
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.060]   He says the hyperloop
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.060]   He's going to publish it
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.060]   You can give that away
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:49.060]   Because it's a multi-billion dollar
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.060]   Thing, right?
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.060]   You can say, "Hey, anybody wants to build one of these?
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.060]   Go right ahead, I don't mind."
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:55.060]   Yeah, well, you know, he doesn't know what this thing is yet
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:57.060]   He's still having meetings
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.060]   In fact, the one that everyone thinks it is
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:04.060]   Is the ET3, which is the evacuation tube transport technology
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.060]   What is it, giant, like, a pneumatic tube?
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.060]   Basically
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.060]   It's a big pneumatic tube
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.060]   You get in this little car
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.060]   Like at the bank
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.060]   It's a small, comfy car
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.060]   And it holds four people
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.060]   The problem
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.060]   The problem with all of this, and I'd love to see how it solves it
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.060]   Is acceleration and deceleration
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:28.060]   Apparently, you can't accelerate too fast or you're jelly
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.060]   Right?
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.060]   So most of that 30 minutes, if it really goes that fast, most of that time
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:35.060]   Is spent accelerating and decelerating
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:38.060]   Yeah, probably about the time you get the speed that you have to start slowing down
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.060]   Well, what about airplanes?
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:41.060]   Don't they have roughly the same problem?
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.060]   No, no, no, there's not that kind of G's
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:47.060]   I mean, we're, if you're gonna go 380 miles in 30 minutes
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.060]   Well, how long is the flight?
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.060]   I guess it's not that fast
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.060]   Yeah, but they're kind of bold-crapping us about the distance
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:56.060]   They keep calling San Francisco to LA if you look at all the documents
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.060]   It's more than 380 miles
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:59.060]   Yeah, it's about 440
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:01.060]   Alright, so let's say at 380
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.060]   Well, it's 380
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:03.060]   Which is not, but let's say it's 380
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:07.060]   In half an hour, that means you're going 760 miles an hour
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.060]   Average, average
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:13.060]   If you're accelerating and decelerating for 10 minutes
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:15.060]   Well, the ET3 will not break the sound barrier
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:15.060]   So that's, although they say they can do, the ET3 guys say they can do up to 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:45.060]   So that's, although they say they can do, the ET3 guys say they can do up to 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:55.060]   I know these guys, and they have all the tech down
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.060]   At ground level?
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.060]   I don't know, ground level
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.060]   Presumably, what?
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.060]   Is it bad to break the sound barrier in a tube?
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:03.060]   I don't know, maybe it makes a big boom at the other end
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.060]   I have no idea
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:07.060]   Somebody said they're waiting for the thing and they get blown off the platform
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:11.060]   So how are they dealing with the right-of-way issue?
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:14.060]   In other words, they're going to have to put this on land somewhere
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:17.060]   Or even underland, they've got to buy the land or have the rights to put it there
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:20.060]   No, it's going to be a whole bunch of legal issues building something to speak
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:24.060]   If anybody else said I'm going to do this, people would just go, you know
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:26.060]   But it's Elon Musk
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:27.060]   Right?
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.060]   Yeah
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:32.060]   I mean, he's sent things into space that are docking with the international
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.060]   That's Tony Stark
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.060]   You can go to space, you can go to LA
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.060]   You're not feeling glad we're all afraid of that
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.060]   Right to be a lawyer, much worse
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:43.060]   Shooting things into space is just dealing with physics
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.060]   This is dealing with lawyers and governments and
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.060]   And what the hell was that thing?
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.060]   A whole lot of legal issues
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:52.060]   Well, he's not saying he's building it, he says he's going to give up the money
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:53.060]   Sure, yeah, you could do it
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:54.060]   Exactly
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:57.060]   But there's no point mentioning it unless you want to build it
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.060]   Well, yeah, maybe he can get enough in there
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.060]   Well, they tried to run the thing down the peninsula
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:04.060]   And everybody in the peninsula all bent out of shape about the high speed ramp
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.060]   No, you have to go in the next to the five
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:09.060]   And then, and now it goes to the bakersfield or something
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060]   And it has to stop there
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.060]   You think you get a great house?
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:14.060]   Yeah, I mean the bakersfield, how are they?
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:14.060]   A bus
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:17.060]   I got here in three hours, we can think of eight hour bus ride
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.060]   Yeah, no, it's bad
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.060]   AT&T, T-Mobile and
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:24.060]   Verizon all now have
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:28.060]   Very uneconomical upgrade plans
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.060]   T-Mobile started it with their jump plan every six months, a new phone
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:35.060]   AT&T said, well, if you're going to do jump, we're going to do next
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.060]   Verizon says, well, if you're going to do next, we're going to do edge
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.060]   So far nothing from sprint
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:45.060]   All of these allow you to get a new phone every six months
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:50.060]   I mean, there are people not normal people, but the kind of people who listen to the show
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.060]   Or are sitting in our audience who want a new phone every six months
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:56.060]   But what are you paying for this? A lot
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:46:01.060]   It's six months for Verizon and T-Mobile
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:09.060]   And a year for AT&T, and the problem is that T-Mobile, when they did this, they reduced their prices
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:14.060]   When they changed their business model because they dropped contracts and subsidies
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:20.060]   But neither Verizon nor AT&T have changed their prices
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:24.060]   So even though you get this phone and you get it separately, you're paying for it separately
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:28.060]   The prices you pay for the service plans still have the subsidies built in
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:33.060]   So it's like paying twice for the same phone on those two carriers
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.060]   It's not a good deal at all
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.060]   The Verge did some math
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:43.060]   And even if you don't do it every six months, if you just do a new phone every year
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:47.060]   It'll cost you $2,459 on T-Mobile
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:52.060]   $3,000 at Verizon, $3,600 on AT&T
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060]   Wow
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:55.060]   Over the two years, so it's expensive
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:00.060]   So they're just figuring that early adopters can't do math or just love being suckers
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.060]   Is that what that is?
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.060]   Or willing to pay for the privilege
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:08.060]   I mean, I buy unlocked full-price phones and then just put a sim-chip
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:09.060]   What do you do with your old ones?
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.060]   Can I have your HTC One? Please, can I have a-
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.060]   You can have mine, I have one
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.060]   You don't like it?
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.060]   It's okay
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.060]   I'd like to have you use it for a while
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.060]   I'm waiting to stop it, it's not the default Google S1
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:21.060]   I am waiting for the Moto X
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:26.060]   Because the Moto X, that may be, and if I do get that, then I will give you whatever you want
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:29.060]   It will not have a sim card, doesn't have a sim card capabilities
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.060]   Doesn't have a sim card
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.060]   SD card, SD card, I'm sorry
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.060]   Well we don't know, all of that is speculation
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:40.060]   Does the HTC One have the big sim card or the little dinky-spoopy little tiny ones?
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.060]   Ah, nobody has a big sim card?
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.060]   No
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:45.060]   I had one on my two-year-old phone
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:48.060]   Yeah, from Google I/O two years ago
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:53.060]   The problem with sim cards on Android in general is it's not really what- like it doesn't extend your storage
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:56.060]   It's a separate thing you could put music and photos on
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:02.060]   It's not, it doesn't, you know, if you don't have enough main storage as you don't with the Galaxy S416 gigs
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.060]   You're screwed even if it's- I have a 64 gig sim card in here
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:07.060]   But I still have to watch my memory
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.060]   Because most apps have to live on the main...
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:10.060]   Pardon me?
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.060]   SD card is not a-
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.060]   What did I say?
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.060]   You said sim card too
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:18.060]   I meant a- I meant a SD card, thank you
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:20.060]   I threw everybody off, I'm sorry
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.060]   Not a sim card, nothing to do with a sim card
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.060]   Oh, you were talking about sim cards
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.060]   I was talking about SD cards
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.060]   You were talking about sim cards
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.060]   I'm talking about sim cards
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.060]   Why were you talking about sim cards?
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.060]   Do the hell cares?
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.060]   There's a little bitty one, what is the one
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.060]   Who the hell cares?
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:35.060]   I do
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:38.060]   I have a cutter, I'll give it to you, you can cut it to any size
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:43.060]   Seriously, you could take a full-sized sim, cut it to a micro-nano sim
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.060]   It all works
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.060]   I'll get it from you
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:47.060]   She's a laser cutter, just do it
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.060]   Yeah, and you could grave your initials on it
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.060]   Or a picture of a raccoon if you were really there
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:51.060]   Apparently, there's-
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:53.060]   I'm gonna get a raccoon tat
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:54.060]   Well, it's tension-
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.060]   Oh, you should!
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.060]   I should!
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.060]   A raccoon like this
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.060]   Like, just a cross-line bag
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:48:59.060]   Flying! A flying-
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.060]   Ohhhhhhh!
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.060]   And then I can always, like, when a pool party is like an acro-
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.060]   Here we go again
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.060]   A raccoon-
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:06.060]   I'm gonna go back to the raccoon story
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.060]   This Netflix-
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.060]   This Netflix-
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.060]   A circular show, it's weird
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.060]   Congratulations, high-fived in Netflix
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.060]   Emmy nominations
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:17.060]   It's first for both House of Cards and Arrested Development
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.060]   So House of Cards, I get Arrested Development
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:21.060]   I agree with her again
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:22.060]   Oh no, Arrested Development was good
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:23.060]   Just don't get us on the show together anymore
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.060]   'Cause there's too much agreement
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.060]   I thought Arrested Development was good
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.060]   Three nominations, Jason Bateman, Outstanding Lead Actor
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:31.060]   In a Comedy Series, Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.060]   For a Comedy Series
[01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:35.060]   That's a category
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:37.060]   Outstanding Music Composition for a Series
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.060]   House of Cards nominated for-
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.060]   Do you have a one-camera shoot?
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.060]   How cheap is that?
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.060]   Is that operation?
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.060]   No, that's the new thing, it's a look
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:44.060]   It's a look
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:46.060]   'Cause everything's moving around
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:48.060]   So when you talk, I point the camera-
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.060]   Oh, you know my dad's a-
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.060]   Well, the next reality television scene-
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:53.060]   Yeah, no, it's good, I like that
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.060]   It's a-
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:55.060]   It's a-
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.060]   It's a-
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.060]   It's like you go-
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:58.060]   Oh my god, I'm gonna throw out-
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.060]   Hey, you're an old man
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.060]   Hey, you're the old man
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.060]   I'm a young man trying to get by
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.060]   *Laughter*
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.060]   House of Cards nominated for Outstanding Direction
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:10.060]   From David Fincher

[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:20.060]   Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.060]   Which is quite good, the main title is great, huh?
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.060]   There's nothing about House of Cards that I don't love
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:28.060]   It was until 2008, the Internet was even eligible for an Emmy
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.060]   What's the end of heaven that means?
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.060]   I would suspect Kevin Spacey's behind this change
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:34.060]   You should get Kevin Spacey on the show
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:36.060]   You know, we were gonna-
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:38.060]   Yeah, Dana, what's his name?
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.060]   Yeah, in fact I called Dana
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.060]   And I said Dana, I want Kevin on
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:44.060]   When House of Cards came out and he said he's on vacation
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.060]   When Season 2 is ready to be released, we'll have him on
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.060]   So yeah, awesome, yeah, Kevin's great
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.060]   Kevin's a geek too, he's really into technology
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.060]   Oh yeah, he's really into Dana Brunetti
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.060]   I remember when we had him on the screen savers, it was cool
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.060]   Why are you bringing me an Emmy?
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.060]   And now the Emmy goes to House of Cards
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.060]   That's a very small Emmy
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.060]   Yeah, it's a regional
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.060]   So, House of Cards win
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:10.060]   It's good that it get nominated, but will it win?
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.060]   What is it up against?
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.060]   I don't know!
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.060]   Yes, it will win
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:16.060]   You know why I think it can win?
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:17.060]   House of Cards will win
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.060]   Best lead actor in a drama Kevin Spacey?
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:20.060]   Yeah, he'll win
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:22.060]   Best lead actress in a drama, Robyn Wright
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.060]   Brian Cranston?
[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.060]   Mmm-hmm
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:26.060]   Brian Cranston's good, you're right, you're talking
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.060]   Breaking Bad, and they ended their season
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:31.060]   You know what else might have been nominated
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.060]   Had it come out a little sooner
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:35.060]   Orange is the new black, which is also a Netflix
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:37.060]   Original is quite good
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:39.060]   Everyone is talking about it, I have an
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.060]   It's a prison one
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.060]   It's a prison one
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.060]   It's a prison one
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:43.060]   It's a prison
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.060]   The vampire one's true blood
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:47.060]   No, no, no, there's a new one
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.060]   Oh yeah, yeah, there's a new one
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:50.060]   That's also a Netflix?
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.060]   Yeah, there's one on Netflix
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.060]   Or is it Amazon Original?
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:53.060]   Because Amazon's doing this too
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.060]   I don't know what this is
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.060]   Hip-lock
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.060]   It's on the internet, John
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.060]   Oh
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.060]   Hemlock
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.060]   Yeah, Hemlock
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:02.060]   Which is kind of like a twin-peek's rim off
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:03.060]   Hemlock Road
[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.060]   Oh, I'm gonna watch, is that on Netflix?
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.060]   Yeah, it looks really like
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.060]   I'll tell you why it's a story
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:10.060]   Because Netflix, which was
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.060]   Originally the idea of DVDs by mail
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:16.060]   Which now seems kind of antiquated
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.060]   Is completely pivoting into a content creation company
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.060]   They want to be the next HBO, I think that's fascinating
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.060]   Yeah, it's fascinating
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.060]   And I think they're doing a good job of it
[01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:24.060]   It's a fascinating point, but
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:27.060]   Alright, alright, let's talk about something else
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:31.060]   The Nintendo Entertainment System turns 30
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:32.060]   The Famicom
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.060]   Famicom, remember that?
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:37.060]   Yeah, some people still have them and use them
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:40.060]   If I had a Sega Dreamcast, I'd still use that
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:41.060]   I still have one
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:42.060]   Oh, can I borrow one?
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:44.060]   Did you get the fishing reel from the game?
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.060]   Sega, you have that too?
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:47.060]   Yeah
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.060]   Oh, man
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:51.060]   The Famicom saved an industry
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:56.060]   On July 15th, 1983
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:59.060]   Is there any hope for Nintendo? Is it kind of over?
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.060]   Not against the PlayStation 4?
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.060]   No, you say no hope or no, it's not over
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:06.060]   I think from the hardware side, it's kind of hard
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:07.060]   I disagree
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.060]   They'll be like Sega, they'll produce all their great content
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.060]   For everybody else's console
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.060]   I don't think so
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:15.060]   Have they started doing that yet? Can you get Mario and anything else?
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:18.060]   No, it's still unique, exclusive content
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:21.060]   I have the new one and it's just, I don't know
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.060]   Then it being HD
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.060]   The Wii, which is awesome
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:24.060]   Yeah, the Wii U
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:25.060]   It is HD finally
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:26.060]   Yeah, it's finally HD
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:31.060]   I would give just about anything to play original Super Mario Brothers
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:33.060]   That's because of your age
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.060]   On X-X
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.060]   You are of an age, you are of that generation
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:37.060]   What's your song?
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:38.060]   You're an ageist
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.060]   No, but I have no interest in anything on Nintendo
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:42.060]   Yes
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.060]   I wouldn't play it, but that's, that was, when I was 22
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.060]   That was the game
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.060]   How old were you when you played Mario?
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:50.060]   Eight
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:51.060]   Eight
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:53.060]   You see, they didn't have video games when I was eight
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.060]   We had rocks
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.060]   I knew something was coming
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:57.060]   Sometimes we'd paint them
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:59.060]   I had rocks, I had lots of mud
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.060]   But then once I was in the middle of the day
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:02.060]   Yeah, raccoons too, but I never thought of throwing them
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.060]   There you go
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:06.060]   You learned something on this show, ladies and gentlemen
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:08.060]   This is long enough
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:10.060]   Tim Stevens, who's been a regular on this show many times
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:13.060]   As EIC and Engadget is out
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:15.060]   What's he doing now?
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.060]   Gadgets Mark Perten
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.060]   Remember your AOL bought gadget?
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:20.060]   Mark Perten from Gadgets
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.060]   Taking over as Engadget head
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:25.060]   Until they find a new editor in chief
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:27.060]   Not clear according to TechCrunch
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.060]   Whether Stevens Resign or was terminated
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:34.060]   AOL says he resigned
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:36.060]   Love Tim
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:39.060]   Tim, come on the show, talk about it
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.060]   You want to, you want to bitch and moan? You can
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.060]   I give you permission
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.060]   I'm sure you signed something
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.060]   I'm sure you signed something
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:48.060]   Someone just sold a Bitcoin business for 11.4
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:51.060]   A Bitcoin business for 11.4 million dollars
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:53.060]   Who?
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:56.060]   Are you investing in Bitcoin in any way?
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.060]   Ah, a little bit
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:54:59.060]   Really? A little bit
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.060]   I did one, it was Ripple
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.060]   Called OpenCoin
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:06.060]   It's more of a transit for virtual currencies
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.060]   Ah, so it's agnostic
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:09.060]   Yeah, it's agnostic
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:10.060]   Yeah, and then
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:12.060]   There's one other one I'm looking at right now
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.060]   That's currently in this
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:15.060]   Y-common-error class coming out
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:16.060]   If you want
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:18.060]   But the cryptocurrency is here to stay
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.060]   I don't know if Bitcoin is going to be the winner
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.060]   But I would imagine that, you know, 10 years from now
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:25.060]   If we like open our eyes, well, there'll be a decentralized digital currency
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:26.060]   I would say yes
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:27.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.060]   Because it's anonymous
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.060]   It's friction-free
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.060]   What else? What else do you see?
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.060]   No transaction fees
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.060]   How about the government going after them?
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.060]   They can't
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.060]   Ah, that's an interesting question
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.060]   I mean, that's the risk, of course, right?
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.060]   If you can talk about risk factors
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.060]   Government puts us out of business
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.060]   We can't look at business in the United States
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:45.060]   But like, as far as the currency is concerned
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:46.060]   With it being decentralized
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:48.060]   Right, there's no one to put out of business
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.060]   Right
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:51.060]   That's kind of intriguing
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.060]   Because when you look at, for instance, credit card companies
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:57.060]   Saying, you know, we're not going to enable payments for VPN services anymore
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:00.060]   Because we feel that they have been used for piracy
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:04.060]   Of course, VPN services are used for a lot of legitimate, completely legitimate things
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.060]   Yeah, I want to watch the BBC, for example
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.060]   Well, that's piracy, but...
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.060]   How's it piracy?
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:10.060]   And watch the BBC and...
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.060]   You're bypassing geographic restrictions
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:13.060]   So what?
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:14.060]   How's that piracy?
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.060]   I mean, it is illegal
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.060]   I mean, it is illegal
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:18.060]   I mean, I just want to watch it
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.060]   Probably should be arrested
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:21.060]   Yeah, probably should be arrested by the cops
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:24.060]   Anyway, that's going to keep things like Bitcoin
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.060]   And other cryptocurrencies alive
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:28.060]   Because if you want to use a VPN and you can't use a credit card
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:31.060]   Suddenly, Bitcoin seems very desirable
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:35.060]   It also preserves your anonymity, so you can really steal stuff privately
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:39.060]   Oh, there are not many people who need that exact service for that exact reason
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.060]   I think you'd be surprised how many people are using it for that
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.060]   I know I'd be surprised
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:44.060]   Like, you've heard of Silk Road and things like that?
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:45.060]   Yeah, that's for drugs
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.060]   That's drugs
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:48.060]   It's all kinds of stuff, weapons, drugs
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:50.060]   Well, it hasn't been government-subscription
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.060]   Walk over here to Oakland, you can buy all the drugs you want
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.060]   Anyway, sorry for that
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:55.060]   I don't want care
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.060]   But can you do it anonymously?
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:58.060]   With the assurance of the...
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.060]   If you wear a Nixon mask
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.060]   I'm old fashioned that way
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:04.060]   Let's take a break
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.060]   We got a...
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.060]   Should we wear a Nixon mask?
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.060]   Wow, it's hot
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.060]   That'd be something
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:09.060]   Audible.com
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:11.060]   My friends, Audible.com
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:14.060]   The ultimate audio bookstore getting better all the time
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.060]   Well over 100,000 titles now
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:19.060]   Save my life when I was commuting to tech TV
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.060]   I mean, I would have, I would have for sure either
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:24.060]   Driven into a tree or killed somebody with road rage
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.060]   Two hours, three hours a day sometimes
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:28.060]   On the road, but I was listening to great books
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.060]   Now I've got 500 plus books
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.060]   In my library, all the greatest stuff
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:35.060]   You know what the best time of the month for me is?
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:38.060]   Well, everyone...
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:40.060]   You got Jolie about the crack-up here
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.060]   Your moon time?
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:42.060]   No
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:43.060]   What is it?
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:45.060]   When I've got two credits on Audible
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:48.060]   I got actually a day because the 22nd is going to be right now
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.060]   Are you telling me?
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.060]   It's a good time of the month
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:51.060]   You know what I just got?
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:52.060]   What did I get?
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.060]   What I cooked?
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.060]   Michael Pollan's...
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.060]   Oh, I love Michael Pollan
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:57.060]   Are you telling me that you just don't get
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:58:00.060]   a fire hose of books from Audible?
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:04.060]   No, I've sold more Audible product than anybody in the world
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:05.060]   I know, but my ethical...
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.060]   My ethical foundation
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:08.060]   I should have found thousand credits right now
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:10.060]   I should and I don't
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.060]   I pay for it just like everybody else does
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.060]   I don't mind, it's worth it
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:16.060]   Cooked a natural history of transformation
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.060]   But it's about cooking, right?
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:19.060]   It is true, but it is true
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.060]   He's the guy who...
[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:22.060]   Locally-larian or whatever you...
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:23.060]   Locatorian eating, right?
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:24.060]   And the food...
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:25.060]   Yeah, all those...
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.060]   He's fabulous.
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:28.060]   Alright, I'm going to put that on my list
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:31.060]   Let's see, so now what I do is I add that to my wish list
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.060]   or add it to my next list
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.060]   Add to your cart
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:34.060]   Add it to my cart
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:36.060]   But I also want to read this
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:38.060]   I'm going to read this book
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:59:04.660]   It's called "The
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:05.660]   Why?"
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:06.660]   I don't want to become a Scientology
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:07.660]   I'm just curious about the...
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:08.660]   The cults
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:09.660]   Yeah, the cult stuff
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.660]   Band of brothers, the E Company
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:13.660]   that Steven Ambrose, classic history
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.660]   that became of course the TV show
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:17.660]   Band of brothers
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:18.660]   Yeah
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.660]   I would love to read the original of that
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.660]   What, he follows...
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:22.660]   He follows...
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.660]   He follows...
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.660]   Yeah, listen, well I listen, I consider that reading
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:27.660]   because every word that's in the book is coming into my head
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.660]   just not through my eyeballs but through my ear holes
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:30.660]   That's reading
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:31.660]   That's part of the brain
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:32.660]   You're part of the brain
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:35.660]   Well, do you think I understand a book differently
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.660]   because I listen to it?
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:37.660]   Yes, I do
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:38.660]   Yes, totally
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.660]   Well, it depends like from people
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:41.660]   You guys are all...
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.660]   Different people learn differently
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:44.660]   Well, I understand that
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:47.660]   But do you think it's lesser somehow than a read better?
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:49.660]   Yes, it might be more like storytelling
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.660]   It might actually be better
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:51.660]   I think it's more natural
[01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:52.660]   Go either way
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660]   Go either way
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:54.660]   What writers...
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:55.660]   What do writers say?
[01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:58.660]   Writers always have the sense that reading
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.660]   and hearing are two different parts of the brain
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.660]   They get the moral scientists right over here if you want to know
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:03.660]   What do you think, Daria?
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.660]   I love all of them
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.660]   She loves all of them
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:06.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:07.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:08.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:09.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:10.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:10.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:11.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:12.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:13.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:14.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:15.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:15.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:16.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:17.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:18.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:19.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:20.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:22.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:23.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:25.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:27.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:28.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:30.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:31.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:32.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:33.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:34.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:36.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:40.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:41.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:42.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:43.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:44.660]   That's all of them

[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:47.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:48.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:50.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:53.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:55.660]   That's all of them
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:56.660]   That's all of them

[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:04.660]   Like that

[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:06.660]   Exercise sucks
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:07.660]   I hate doing it

[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:12.660]   Well being severely like
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:13.660]   Massa kiss
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.660]   So you listen to Beyonce instead?
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:16.660]   I know
[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:17.660]   I listen to the birds
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:18.660]   The birds
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.660]   I go run outside with my dog
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:21.660]   I talk to my dog
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:22.660]   Roger Mcguin the birds
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:23.660]   No
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:24.660]   Actual birds
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:25.660]   You listen to birds
[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:27.660]   And I talk to Barkley
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.660]   Barkley the dog
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.660]   I encourage him
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.660]   So you're running
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:31.660]   And Barkley runs along with it?
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:32.660]   Yeah, he does
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:33.660]   I'm going to play this
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:34.660]   This is William Shatter
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.660]   This is Howard Stern
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.660]   I guess it's where he got it from
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:37.660]   It's just so great
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:39.660]   It really goes on a while too
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:40.660]   That's what's great about it
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.660]   This is not a good word
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:43.660]   This is not a good word
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:44.660]   This is not a good word
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:45.660]   This is not a good word
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:46.660]   This is what it's got a
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:47.660]   Shatter
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:48.660]   And I would like to

[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:17.660]   Well, I'm saying

[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.660]   We'll have to do it the way you
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:40.660]   Slow it down now
[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:41.660]   Don't do it for me

[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:02.660]   Okay, I'll do it that way

[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:18.660]   I'm sure it's dynamite
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.660]   As it deteriorates
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.660]   Anyway, it's on the YouTube
[02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:24.660]   Anyway, audible.com/twit2
[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:26.660]   And that is not how the audible producers are, Dariya
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:27.660]   Don't worry
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:28.660]   They're really good
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:29.660]   You're gonna have fun
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:31.660]   Are they gonna be in studio with you
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:32.660]   Or via an ISDN line?
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:33.660]   How does that work?
[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:35.660]   Oh Harper's doing it
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:36.660]   Your publisher's doing it
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.660]   Ah, great
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:39.660]   And then it will be available
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:41.660]   In bookstores as well as on Audible.com
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:42.660]   Which is great
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:44.660]   You can get cassettes
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:45.660]   (laughter)
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:46.660]   Eight tracks
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660]   Eight tracks the way to go
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:49.660]   I was so glad when Audible came along
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.660]   Because I did used to do it by a cassette
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:53.660]   And you get a box this big 20 cassettes
[02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:55.660]   You know, I have an eight track recorder
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:56.660]   What?
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:57.660]   Yes, indeed
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:06:58.660]   What would you do with that?
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:01.660]   I found it at some sort of a swap media
[02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:04.660]   It's an actually a CHI tape recorder that's got
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:05.660]   That was pretty good
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:08.660]   And an eight track recorder at the bottom
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:09.660]   I think it's valuable
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:10.660]   Anybody interested in buying it
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:11.660]   I'm gonna sell it
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:13.660]   Where do you find blank eight tracks?
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:14.660]   You take an eight track
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.660]   You tear off the lid
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.660]   When you blank it
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.660]   Oh right
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.660]   Because you can do that
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:20.660]   You can do it with the magnetic thing
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.660]   Yes, call it a degauser
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:23.660]   De-gauser
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.660]   I had an eight track recorder
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:28.660]   And I made them for my 1963
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:30.660]   Ford Galaxy
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:31.660]   Oh, living
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:32.660]   Car with the eight track
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.660]   Under the dash
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.660]   Is it my memory faulty
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:37.660]   Or when you change tracks
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:38.660]   An eight track
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:39.660]   Does it make a fairly large clunk?
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:40.660]   It makes a clunk
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:41.660]   Okay
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:42.660]   A clunk
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:43.660]   A clunk
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:44.660]   Right in the middle of a song
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:45.660]   You can do it
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:46.660]   Tunk
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:48.660]   In fact, I still hear songs that way
[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.660]   I will wait
[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:51.660]   Oh, here comes the kachunk
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.660]   I still hear the chunk
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:53.660]   You know
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:54.660]   That's where the kachunk goes
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:55.660]   With the track changes
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:56.660]   Holy cow
[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:58.660]   Well, this has been a lot of fun
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:07:59.660]   I hate to wrap it up
[02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.660]   We had wonderful baked goods
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.660]   We have Cuban cigars
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:05.660]   We have an 18th century computer
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:06.660]   And
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:08.660]   Yes, indeed
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:09.660]   And raccoon
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:10.660]   Coon chucker
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:11.660]   Get it all
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:12.660]   Coon chucker
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.660]   All right, let's give him a winner
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:17.660]   Let's give him a winner
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:19.660]   John, look at our little ninjas
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:21.660]   They're like little ninjas
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.660]   Hey, now you're talking
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:24.660]   And I have to say

[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:27.660]   That's a good one, Chad
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:28.660]   Who did that one?
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.660]   That is awesome
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:30.660]   I'm actually not sure
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.660]   It was sent over
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.660]   I wasn't paying attention
[02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:33.660]   So whoever it was
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:34.660]   sent over
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:35.660]   Retroactive

[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:41.660]   Puppet

[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:52.660]   Delicious waiting for you
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:53.660]   Having involving crawfish
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:54.660]   Crawfish ravioli
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.660]   Ooh, I'm excited
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:57.660]   Now crawfish is spelled crayfish
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.660]   Crawfish, ravioli
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:10:59.660]   Ooh, ooh, ooh
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:00.660]   I'm excited

[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:02.660]   Crayfish?
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.660]   No, it's spelled crawfish
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:04.660]   But with a W, say crayfish
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:05.660]   So we call it crawfish
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:07.660]   And some of you call it mud bugs
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:08.660]   Mud bugs or...
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.660]   Oh, and crawdads
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.660]   Crawdads, yeah, yeah
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:12.660]   Does that depend on where in
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:14.660]   Louisiana or Texas you are?
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:15.660]   And how drunk you are

[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.660]   Yeah, I do
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:28.660]   It's awesome
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:29.660]   I did this year
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:30.660]   I just had an abundance of energy
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:31.660]   And June
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:32.660]   It's gone now

[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:37.660]   Oh, not at all

[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   Available now at Etsy
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.660]   Cherry Jam
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:46.660]   For less.net
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:50.660]   John C. Devorak
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.660]   Noah Jenna Show.com
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.660]   What have you been talking
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:54.660]   about lately with that curry
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.660]   guy?
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:56.660]   We've been talking about
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.660]   All kinds of deconstructions
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:58.660]   That you should listen to
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:11:59.660]   The show once in a while
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:00.660]   I think that this is really a
[02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:01.660]   Panopticon event
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:02.660]   I'm not sure
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:03.660]   What you mean?
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:05.660]   Yes, you do
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:06.660]   You don't?
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:07.660]   No
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:08.660]   You know, the Panopticon was
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:10.660]   that Jeremy Bentham's prison
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.660]   Where the guards could observe
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:13.660]   The inmates
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:14.660]   Oh, you mean in terms of the way
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.660]   We're being dealt with as a
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:16.660]   public?
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:17.660]   I think
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:18.660]   You can use this on the show
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:19.660]   If you want
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:21.660]   Oh, let me take a note
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:24.660]   Let me grab my air pan
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:25.660]   And I'll write this down
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:26.660]   Edward Snowden and others are
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:28.660]   Really doing the bidding of the
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:30.660]   NSA who would like us to think
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:32.660]   That they can observe at any time
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:33.660]   Anywhere
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:35.660]   We've discussed this as a
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.660]   probably lack that capability
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:38.660]   But it's a useful fiction
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:40.660]   We sometimes posit such a thesis
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.660]   Yes, all right
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:44.660]   That's like conspiracies inside
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:45.660]   Conspiracies
[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:46.660]   That's why you listen to no
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:47.660]   Agenda for us
[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:48.660]   That way you can see it
[02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.660]   Oh, you get it's
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:51.660]   Metametta
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:52.660]   Metametta
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:53.660]   Metamusil
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.660]   Also, it's a lie
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.660]   It's a conspiracy to make us
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:12:57.660]   Think the conspiracy
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:58.660]   It could be a conspiracy to do
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:12:59.660]   That
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:00.660]   We could be behind the whole
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:01.660]   Thing
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.660]   Interesting
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:03.660]   So, you have

[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.660]   That didn't work out
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:24.660]   They got that
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.660]   Rawl guy

[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:33.660]   No, no
