[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   And we've got three great contributors here on the panel,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.480]   starting in my upper left.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.280]   Lance Ulinoff from PC Magazine.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   Hey, Lance, good to see you again.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.920]   Editor in chief.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.600]   That's correct.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   PCmag.com.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.920]   That's where you can go.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840]   That's where you can go to find Lance.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.760]   He's holding down the fort for traditional technology
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.720]   journalism.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840]   Thank God somebody is.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.720]   I'm trying.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.240]   A little less traditional, but still nonetheless authoritative.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.360]   Ryan Block from Gadget, gdgt.com.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.760]   Formerly of end gadget.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.360]   Yes.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   I like gadgets.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.760]   Unended.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.240]   And I'm going to see you in Paris.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   You and Veronica are going to Paris for Lou Webb.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   That's right.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.440]   That's right.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.560]   Are you going to be in San Francisco's Friday?
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.680]   You're having a big event on Friday.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.020]   We are.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.240]   In fact, I think we're bringing cameras down and covering it.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   Are we not?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.920]   You guys are.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.160]   But I want to see you there, Leo.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.880]   Personally, you don't have to be covering it.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   I just want to see you there.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.400]   So gadget does these events.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.040]   Your first one was in San Francisco.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.000]   You're coming back to San Francisco for the first time.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.040]   So what is it that you do?
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.680]   Basically, we do a consumer event
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   where we bring a whole bunch of gadget and personal technology
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.040]   companies together under one roof.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.680]   And we open it to the public.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.240]   We do free drinks.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.840]   We give away t-shirts.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.720]   Just a lot of awesome stuff.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.240]   We have a ridiculous amount of amazing.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.920]   We have almost 50 companies this time, which
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960]   is by far the biggest event we've ever done.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.280]   You're going to have any of that vault plus caffeine stuff
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480]   that you were drinking the other day?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.080]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   You know that stuff that's the alcoholic beverage in a can
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.280]   that has caffeine in it?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.680]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.800]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   Yeah, you know the stuff that the binge drinkers in colleges
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.000]   are killing themselves with?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.680]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.560]   No, I just go with traditional caffeine.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   I'm just a coffee can I get personally?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.160]   Well, maybe it was Mark Millian that was drinking that.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   Mark Millian, hey, congratulations on the new gig.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.560]   Mark, the last time we talked was with the LA Times.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   You've moved on to CNN.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.080]   That's right.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   I profiled you in the LA Times.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.960]   Yeah, now I'm at CNN and moved to San Francisco.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.880]   So enjoying the new city.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.960]   And it's good to see you, Leo.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600]   And I guess I'll see you on Friday at Ryan's party.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.520]   I guess I don't have any choice.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.400]   Actually, it's loco.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   It's that loco stuff.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.480]   L-O-K-O or CEO.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.080]   L-O-C-O.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.760]   You know in the can?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.600]   Nothing.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.000]   Come on, Ryan.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Sorry, man.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.840]   Can't help you.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.120]   I sure it was on Instagram.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.000]   I saw you drinking that.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.600]   Maybe it wasn't you.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Maybe it was MG Seagler.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   That sounds right, huh?
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.960]   He's got the kind of job right now.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.880]   For loco.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.080]   Really beyond his game.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.040]   It's for the binge drinker in us all.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   Yeah, I think it was.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.400]   It was "Cirilanus."
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.760]   It's actually now that I remember it.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.680]   It was "Cirilanus."
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.200]   So welcome.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   It was good to see you all.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.120]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.280]   How many of you--
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.880]   Lance is doing the Connect thing.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   How many of you have been playing with the Microsoft?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.960]   I got mine on--
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   was it Thursday?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.200]   Oh, you already playing with it?
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.560]   Oh, I love it.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.200]   I've tried it.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.360]   I like it.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.760]   What's your favorite game?
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.480]   Dance Central.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.240]   Well, I only have two.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   I have the one that came with it, which is Connect Adventures.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.280]   This is the new--
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.480]   it was originally called Project Natale.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.960]   Microsoft has been adding a camera.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.320]   It's actually a couple of cameras.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.400]   It's a video camera plus an infrared sensor to a bar
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   that goes below the TV, hooks up to your Xbox 360.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.640]   And then if you have a Connect-enabled game,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   instead of using a joystick or controller,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.520]   it has voice control, pretty good voice control.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.240]   But mostly, it's about your body.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.280]   And it sees your whole body.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.760]   So unlike the Wii or the Move controller,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.080]   it's not just what you're holding.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   You're not holding anything.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600]   It's what you're doing.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.440]   Yeah, it doesn't just see your body.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.040]   It sees the whole room.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.600]   It sees that.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.040]   It does.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   In fact, they say that some people have said
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.040]   that it works better with white people.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.920]   It's racist.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.680]   And that is not true.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.240]   You don't think that's true, Lance?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   It was about the lighting in the room, right?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.960]   It's funny.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.880]   I was just thinking about this just by chance,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.520]   the young man who reviewed it for PCMag,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.280]   Jeff Wilson is an African-American,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.840]   who happened to fall in love with the product.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.600]   And just said how it consistently
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.640]   caught all of his movements.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.200]   It was almost flawless.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.520]   So I think that's proof.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.280]   I think it works pretty well.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.440]   And it recognizes me.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.280]   And I'm very dark skinned for an Italian.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.400]   No, I like it.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.680]   I was playing the dance central game.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.840]   So I have the Connective Ventures.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.360]   It comes with that.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.400]   But I bought Dance Central.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.880]   And that's the game where you guy a guy dancing,
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.200]   and then you mimic the moves.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   And it's got all this modern music for the young people,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.320]   things like the Kingston Trio.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.120]   I just love it.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.880]   I really had a great time.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.000]   And my kid-- now here, this is interesting-- my 16-year-old
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   kid who poo-pooed the Wii.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.800]   Thought the Wii was stupid.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.520]   Loved it too.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.280]   In fact, his friends, they were all doing it.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.480]   So I think this might have a--
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   how about you, Ryan?
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.000]   You must have played with this.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.640]   Or does this not follow in your--
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.400]   No, no, I played it.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.520]   I read a little review of it.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   Which thing?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.480]   It's pretty good.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.600]   Here's the question.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.440]   Will it have legs?
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.760]   Yeah, I'm not a Wii fan either.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.320]   Will it have legs?
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.560]   Will it survive better than the Wii did?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   The Wii had a pretty good run so far.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   And it's not dead.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.800]   But we all heard the story, I think, a week, week and a half
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.640]   ago about how Nintendo had its first net loss
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.040]   and a quarter in over seven years.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.440]   So they are clearly on the descent right now.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.080]   They're going downhill.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.000]   They're not going uphill anymore.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.680]   Wii is just not--
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.520]   I've always felt like the Wii was kind of a gimmick.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.880]   And it didn't really have a lot of substance.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.640]   You know one of the reasons that the Wii's kind of going
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.480]   downhill is its low-res screen.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   It's not a high def.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.400]   Right, Nintendo managed to spend the last couple of years
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.480]   not updating it.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.200]   They're just riding on the initial success.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.040]   And because a console like a Wii or the Xbox or the PlayStation,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   they're all more than just gaming systems.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.120]   You do things like watch Netflix movies.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.160]   Well, who wants to watch a Netflix movie on a Wii when
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.360]   it's going to be 480p at best?
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   That is the biggest problem with the Wii.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.960]   If they had upgraded the resolution in some way,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.240]   I think they'd still be running.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.840]   I mean, look, they made a lot of money on it.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.920]   It was a best-selling console for a couple of three years.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.080]   But I think maybe you're right.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.280]   The time has come.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.960]   Well, it was also the cheapest console for the time too.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.480]   And the cheapest console is usually the best-selling console.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.360]   But in terms of a tax rate, which
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.440]   is what the industry--
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.760]   it's the industry term for how many games and accessories
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   and products do you buy to go along with the console.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.720]   Because that's where the real money is made.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.000]   The money is almost never made on the console.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's usually made in software licensing.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.280]   The Wii was the best-selling console,
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.080]   but it had by far the worst-attached rate.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.320]   So Nintendo is not making its money
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.520]   by selling a lot of video games from other people.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.160]   It was making all of its money by selling the console
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.640]   and by selling first-party games.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.560]   I bought the console.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.520]   I bought the Wii Fit.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   I bought three games.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   And I never bought anything again after that.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.160]   Pretty much.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.200]   I mean, my Wii is basically sat there forever.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.440]   I've never really used it.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.160]   Every time I try to use it, I get very frustrated with it.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.320]   We also haven't seen a lot of good game releases
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   from Nintendo or otherwise in the last few months.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.120]   I mean, I'm looking forward to the Zelda game.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.600]   I'm hanging on to my Wii for that.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.440]   But otherwise, maybe Donkey Kong,
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.240]   but there's really not that much coming out
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.040]   that I'm very excited for for the Wii.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.440]   Is Connect--
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.120]   it's the same kind of social gaming.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.240]   Is it going to-- Mark, you think it'll replace the Wii,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.600]   or do you think it's good enough to be the next big thing?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.000]   I don't have an Xbox, but I have played with it,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.720]   and I played with it quite a bit at E3.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.760]   And my favorite game was Adventures.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.360]   I really enjoyed that one.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.120]   That comes with it.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.760]   And so you get that part of the price to--
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.480]   Yeah, you know, I was talking to Phil Spencer, who's at Xbox.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   And he was saying that Adventures was the very first idea
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.000]   and the very first game that they worked on.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.640]   I mean, they had this idea from the get-go,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.960]   and they're like, wouldn't this be an awesome idea?
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.320]   And then they gave sports to Rare.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.600]   And it seems like they're going to be investing a whole lot
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.280]   into this system, but still not--
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.080]   I mean, not throwing the hardcore gamers out.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.480]   They've still got Gears of War and all of these games coming
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.040]   out that they're focusing on.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.720]   So it's really splitting the system
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.760]   into two separate audiences as far as I see it.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.320]   I've only played one sort of gamers game on this motion
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.120]   control stuff, and it was actually on the move.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.160]   I had one of those devices with a little soft end.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.960]   For some reason on the Connect thing, it's been--
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   at least at first blush, it's been
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.800]   a lot of family-oriented games, which, you know,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   I think is a good way for the company to get started
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.120]   with this particular market because they know
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.320]   that Nintendo was so successful,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.760]   but they can't ride on that.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.320]   They got to do a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.480]   But the technology is very extensible.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.080]   I think they'll keep refining it.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.160]   They'll probably be able to do a lot in software.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.640]   They have that company that actually
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.960]   develop the technology behind it that's still working on it,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.400]   and I think they'll get more from them.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.840]   So once they get this in the house
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.280]   and you don't have to keep selling them new devices to hold,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.200]   I think it's going to be pretty successful.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   I think the problem with that family-first strategy
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.920]   lance is that Nintendo never really
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.680]   did anything with it on the Wii.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.840]   We still haven't really seen a whole lot of hardcore games,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.600]   and the people who go out and buy dozens of games a year
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.760]   aren't taking to the Wii because there aren't titles that
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   are geared toward them.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   So if Microsoft wants to create this sort of like casual
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.160]   gamer thing, then they have to wait it with something else
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.760]   that's going to keep their hardcore consumer satisfied.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.000]   You know, maybe a problem with the Wii's
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.600]   or the connect is latency.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.520]   I don't know.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.120]   I mean, it's very hard to overcome this very slight lag
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.160]   as the thing sees you, senses you, and tells the game where
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.920]   you are.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.480]   And while that's not a big deal when you're dancing or ducking
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.720]   or river rafting, it might be a huge deal
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.800]   if you're trying to shoot an alien.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.160]   I don't know.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.800]   There are definitely some issues there.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.080]   I think that when you look at Microsoft and the connect,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   though, you do kind of have to look at it
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.120]   as them catering to two different markets.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.960]   And I don't think the connect is intended
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.000]   to be your mechanism of gameplay for something
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.560]   like Call of Duty or Gears of War.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.720]   I mean, they've been pretty clear that they see those games
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.160]   as working best on the controller.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.120]   And I think that they do.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.160]   And I think that most hardcore games are a gamer's game does.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.200]   And I think that that's part of the reason why the Wii
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.760]   has had such a hard time is because the Wii control mechanism
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.680]   have really worked best for the kinds of more casual games
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.440]   that you don't really have to do as much with.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.000]   I mean, they're just not as many gamers' games on the Wii.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.240]   And Microsoft has that.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.800]   They've proven that they've been able to do that really well.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.280]   And they're now number one and number two in almost every single one
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.400]   of those metrics that you would use.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.080]   So I think connect is really about broadening it, making a larger--
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.080]   larger.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.720]   Yeah, in fact, if you think about they own the hardcore game market,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.040]   they own-- I think the set top box market right now, Xbox 360,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.560]   is still, I think, the best set top box
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   if you want to watch Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.000]   has its own movie, service, sales, and rental.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.520]   And then you add family or social gaming, which
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.400]   seems to me a new category that we invented.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.120]   You pretty much cover the waterfront, don't you?
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.560]   Isn't that the device everybody wants in their living room?
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   I think so.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.280]   You know what I wonder?
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.160]   I wonder how excited any hardcore gamer
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.240]   is about any of these motion control technologies.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.720]   I still feel like they trust the controller more.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.120]   Just because we were talking about you, they're very competitive.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.560]   Well, think about PC gamers' laughing consoles
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.360]   because they have a whole keyboard,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.560]   and the consoles just have these few buttons.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.720]   Right, but then they use those buttons.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.200]   I mean, if you see, for example, you see my son,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.040]   I mean, he is a master with that Xbox controller.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.840]   But then watch somebody play "Starcraft" on a keyboard,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.040]   and you see why they want all that control.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.920]   That's a good point.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   I've heard a lot of game publishers
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.440]   have tested the idea of interoperability
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.480]   between PC gamers and console gamers.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.280]   It's just not fair.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.760]   And for a decade, I've been thinking,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   why can't I play my friend who has the computer version of this game?
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.520]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.960]   But exactly, the PC gamers kill them time and time again,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.760]   just because they're so much better with the controls
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.480]   than using a cramped handheld controller.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.400]   Microsoft actually tested this a few years ago, if you remember.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.800]   They created a system where certain games
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:34.720]   would be compatible on Xbox Live on Windows and on Xbox.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.480]   And they actually did find that they had to shut it down,
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.360]   basically, because the console gamers were getting creamed.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.840]   But at the same time, it's like, there are different kinds of games
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.200]   work better on different platforms.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.480]   And controllers work better for platform style games
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   than they do first person shooters.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.920]   And keyboard and mouse works better for first person shooters
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.480]   than it does for a game like Mario.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.640]   So there's no right or wrong answer.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.400]   Well, essentially, console sales have not
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.000]   suffered over the years from PC gaming.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.720]   Consoles were invented for platforms,
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.640]   and PCs were invented for first person shooters.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   I mean, well, not invented for, but that's where they made their new--
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.160]   Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.600]   Right.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.120]   Quake.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.000]   My favorites.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.560]   Great games.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.240]   Wolfenstein 3D.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.200]   Wolfenstein, baby.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.360]   Now we're talking--
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.440]   It's not all about which genre of games
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.160]   is best suited for which controllers.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.040]   I mean, there's some just core differences
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.080]   between playing a game on a PC and playing on a console in that.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.560]   And Blizzard has run into this, too.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.760]   It's the same reason they don't put any of their games
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.480]   on the console, because the console is the social experience.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.000]   And a lot of their games do their social through the internet.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.920]   Didn't Steam say that we're going to put Steam on PS3, I thought?
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.480]   Or maybe it was Xbox?
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.280]   They announced that I think it E3.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.840]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.520]   But that's a piece--
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.400]   Yeah, I don't know about that.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.320]   I mean, that's pretty--
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.360]   because Steam is at its core, it's a game distribution system.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.680]   And that is why Microsoft owns with Xbox Live.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.000]   And that's what Sony owns with PlayStation Network
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.280]   and PlayStation Store.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.560]   And so, Nintendo owns with we--
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.720]   whatever it's called, Wii Store.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.320]   I can't remember what it's called.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.840]   I'd be pretty surprised to see that.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   I mean, it'd be pretty awesome.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.920]   But I don't know.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.000]   Valve announces-- I'm looking at the story from June 16.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.680]   Valve announces Steam for PS3 at the E3 show.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.200]   But announcing it, I don't think they ever released it.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.960]   So I don't know.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:42.440]   I wonder if that was when PS3 still supported Linux.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.120]   And so maybe you would install Linux.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.880]   Now the Linux doesn't.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.160]   Now it doesn't.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.120]   So forget it.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.560]   Did you see Leander Kehain's story?
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.760]   Which-- what a great story this was.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.080]   I don't know-- a scoop.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.720]   He actually was on an airplane.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.800]   He says, in June 2008, a flight home from Europe to San
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.880]   Francisco.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.240]   And he sat next to Aynan Baraka, who
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.040]   was the CEO of an Israeli company called PrimeSense.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.400]   He had developed Baraka.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.720]   And PrimeSense had developed a low cost chip and software
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.440]   to do 3D machine vision.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.920]   The system used a pair of cameras and an infrared sensor
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.440]   to highlight people, and track their movements.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.960]   He showed it to him, like minority report style motion
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.880]   and movement and so forth.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.920]   And he said, we really wanted to sell it to Apple.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.600]   He said, we think that this technology would be best with
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:29.960]   Apple.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.680]   However, he'd already had several meetings with Apple.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.240]   He said it was the first place they thought of.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.080]   It was the most natural place for the technology.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.560]   But Apple made him-- he said the initial meetings hadn't gone
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   so well-- obsessed with secrecy.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.720]   Apple had already asked Baraka to sign a stack of crippling
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.760]   legal agreements and NDAs.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.480]   He shook his head.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.920]   Why didn't he want to do a deal with Apple?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.120]   No need.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   He said, the technology's hot.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.840]   I'll sell it to anyone.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.320]   He sold it too.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.760]   Microsoft, and it's the heart of Connect.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.240]   Apple, he said, is a pain in the ass.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.120]   Great story.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.040]   I've never heard anyone say that about Apple before.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.480]   I actually heard this exact same story, not same company.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.680]   But you can take prime sense and replace it with company X
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.880]   that told me the story and replace the CEO with that CEO.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.440]   Exact same story.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.920]   And now they're a very, very successful company who's
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.360]   selling to basically everybody but Apple.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.240]   I can add a company Y as well, who I met with about a week
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.320]   ago and had the exact same story.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.560]   I'm working on a profile on them right now, so I don't
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.120]   exactly want to say who it is.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.840]   But it's the exact same deal where they had these talks.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.280]   And they're like, oh, this is sounding good.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.280]   Until they get in the room.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.800]   And Apple says, why don't you just make a prototype for us?
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.600]   And like, oh, all right, well, you
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.360]   think you'll carry it in your app store?
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   And like, no, we just want to see it.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.440]   We like what you have so far, but we
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.200]   want to see one running on iPhone.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.360]   Like, oh, let's talk to one of the other companies that
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.040]   are doing something similar.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.280]   Does that hurt Apple?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.120]   Does that hurt them?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   I mean, can they get away with that?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.000]   Yeah, Apple is really not doing so well these days.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.720]   You got to pity them in there.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   You know, truthy dollars.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.840]   They're just so far behind right now.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.680]   Every single day, I mean, Apple, why do people love Apple
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.520]   products so much?
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.960]   Because they work consistently.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.080]   Because they're in that ecosystem.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.920]   The companies they work with, they make them take a blood
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.320]   oath.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.000]   And they control the environment.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.040]   They control the relationship from A to Z. Microsoft doesn't.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.680]   It's interesting when PrimeSense was at E3.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.960]   They weren't in a little back room.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.440]   And they were sort of showing--
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.960]   they were kind of ripping off the covers of Connect, basically,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.080]   to show you the guts that they had helped provide,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.960]   the middleware.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   And it was weird because I kept saying, well,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.760]   is Microsoft comfortable with you doing this?
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.800]   Like, Microsoft doesn't really care.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   Just the relationship is completely different.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.080]   Microsoft got what they needed.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:04.920]   They're very happy.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.600]   They're going to sell this product.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:06.960]   They should.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.080]   And they sort of just walk away.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.320]   Apple, you know, you're theirs.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.480]   You're theirs until they say you're done.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.360]   Of course, I can remember a time when Microsoft would be just
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.040]   as predatory.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.960]   They'd invite a company.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.760]   And they did this for years in the '80s and '90s.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.720]   Invite a company and say, show us everything.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.760]   Oh, we'd like-- we'd be very interested in acquiring you.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.160]   Then they find out everything.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.400]   Yeah, we're not that interested.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.920]   And then they steal it, basically.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.080]   They're not the same thing.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.320]   So here's the thing that most people
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.520]   tend to forget about Apple.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.600]   And I'm sure that this is going to really piss a lot of people
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.800]   off.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.720]   But Apple, as you know, forward thinking as they are and so
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.840]   on and so forth, they don't really take a lot of risks.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.800]   They don't bet on brand new technologies.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.680]   They are actually very, very conservative.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.040]   Every product that they build is usually
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.840]   based around an existing technology, something
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.360]   that's been around for a long time.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.000]   You're not going to see Apple with the first LTE phone.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.280]   You're not going to see Apple with a YMAX phone.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.480]   They're going to wait until everything is sorted out
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.160]   and the bugs are worked out and the kinks are done.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.920]   And then they're going to get into it.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.960]   So something like this, I don't think
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.040]   that they would have risked it.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.120]   And frankly, for what?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.040]   I mean, what would they have done with it?
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.880]   They tend to wait to see what works out in the marketplace
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.280]   and then adopt it very slowly.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   Look at-- what if--
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.360]   Look at USB 3.0.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.400]   I mean, the list just goes on and on and off.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.920]   Brian, Brian, what if they had incorporated into Apple TV?
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.280]   What if Apple TV was controlled by gestures?
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.480]   I think Apple certainly could have used it for whatever reason.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.400]   You know, Apple needed to make the Apple TV $99.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.240]   Would the Apple TV have been $99 without a connect attached
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.520]   to it?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.840]   It would have been-- the first Apple TV with this thing
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.160]   would have been $500.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.240]   And instead of selling only 20,000 units,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.040]   it would have sold 20 units.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.680]   And the second Apple TV, which is $99,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   would have been $250 or maybe even more--
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.080]   Kind of a contrarian point of view of Apple, though,
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.160]   because you always think of them as an innovator.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.000]   No, I'm not saying that they're not an innovator,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   but there's a difference between innovation
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.920]   and being on the bleeding edge in terms of technology.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.720]   Well, and you set it with Blu-ray and USB 3.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.760]   There's two very good examples of products
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.800]   that I don't think we're ever going to see on Apple.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.200]   Yeah, so there's a very fun line.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.080]   I mean, I would never argue that Apple does not create markets,
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   and then Apple is not a forward-thinking company.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.760]   But people forget, and they tend to confuse these two things,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.840]   that Apple is the most high tech.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.680]   I mean, they're not.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.360]   They actually are low tech in a lot of ways.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.320]   They wait for the technology to become commoditized
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.600]   and to become cheap and to become extremely stable.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.800]   And that's when they execute.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.680]   Well, I think that's sort of a--
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.880]   that's kind of a generalization.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.360]   I think Apple is probably the most strategic technology
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   company out there.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.520]   I wouldn't call them old-fashioned,
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.040]   because of the way in which they're
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.800]   able to put together disparate technologies
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.960]   to make a cohesive thing.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.880]   But I agree with you that they're savvy enough
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.520]   to understand that there's a sort of beautiful marriage
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.040]   between good technology and good pricing,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.400]   a good strategy to market, which is something
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.000]   that you don't see across this industry.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.840]   You don't see in Microsoft right now, which sometimes gets it,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.360]   sometimes doesn't get it right.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.680]   But by the way, that thing about-- you said about LTE.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.640]   You're probably right.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.280]   But at the same time, Apple still can't surprise.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.240]   So I don't know if that's true that we won't see the first LTE
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.560]   phone from Apple.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.400]   But LTE is in this--
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.880]   --a very, very surprising time.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.320]   I mean, we haven't seen any devices running LTE
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.040]   in this country.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.000]   So maybe there's battery problems.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Maybe you'll just have a crappy phone.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.840]   Maybe those first batch of LTE phones
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.480]   just won't be worth having.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.240]   I'm going to go on the record that Apple's not
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.080]   going to have the first.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.640]   Maybe even the second or the third LTE phone,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   they're going to be--
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   You're probably right about that.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.480]   They're going to be later in the game.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.800]   And Lance, let's follow up on email.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.200]   I want to put a gentleman's bet on this, man.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.040]   Interesting.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.800]   How do you know it's really Lance here?
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.320]   It's almost over the last month.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.680]   Could be anyone.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.720]   We don't know who it is.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.600]   All right, hold on, guys.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.120]   This is good.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.680]   Lance Yulinoff is here, PC Magazine Editor-in-Chief.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.320]   Ryan Block of GDGT.com.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   And Mark Millian now of CNN.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.280]   What's your title at CNN now, Mark?
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.400]   What are you doing?
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.720]   I am a tech writer at CNN.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   They're not putting you on camera?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.760]   Sure they are.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.800]   I'm actually going to be on tomorrow morning talking
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.640]   about Google TV.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:31.600]   I think you need--
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.440]   Well, no problem.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.600]   Let's talk about Google TV.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.920]   The Logitech review is out.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.240]   We'll get a review from these guys.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.480]   We also have pricing on the Nintendo 3DS.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.440]   Finally, in fact, we're not done with video games.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   The Supreme Court taking a look at the California law
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.640]   preventing the sale of violent video games to minors.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.560]   Lots more to come.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.080]   In just a second, before we do that, though,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.280]   I'd like to mention our friends at Citrix, who
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.000]   have given us so many great products over the years.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And if you're a business person, you've
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.440]   got to know about go to meeting, it
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.200]   is the way to meet online, to save yourself money and time
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.560]   and stress traveling to an in-person meeting.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.520]   But yet making that conference call, which
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.200]   is normally kind of boring, into something very engaging,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.240]   with visuals, go to meeting.com.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.880]   If you're looking out for ways, as most companies are,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.680]   these days, to cut costs, to improve processes,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.280]   to work more efficiently, I want you to take a look
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.360]   at go to meeting.com.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.160]   You can try it free right now for 30 days.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.520]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.160]   G-O-T-O meeting.com/twit.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.960]   It'll take you about 30 seconds to install.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.640]   Once you've got to install now, you can have a meeting.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.960]   Send an email to a friend or a colleague saying,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   I'd like to show you my PowerPoint presentation.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.400]   I'd like to work together with you on a document.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.840]   I'd like to train you on how to use this software.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.240]   It's good for all of that.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   It improves conference calls by making them visual.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.200]   You share your screen with the conferees.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.160]   And by the way, vice versa if they want.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.240]   They could show you their screen as well.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.640]   They don't even-- and this is important.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.160]   They don't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.200]   With Go to meeting, you send them the invitation.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.120]   They click the link.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.760]   It takes about 30 seconds to install.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.880]   Boom, they're ready and ready to go.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.480]   I just love it.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.040]   Go to meeting.com/leo.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.680]   Give it a try.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.040]   We know you'll like it.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.120]   Folks at Citrix have really done a great job.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.320]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.000]   So the Nintendo 3DS--
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.120]   I don't know if this is a leak.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.240]   I don't think it's an official announcement.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.520]   This is the product they showed.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   I was un--
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.880]   I was underwhelmed by this at the-- at E3.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.960]   Comes out in Japan February 26th of next year in March
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.920]   in the US and Europe.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.600]   So it was more than a year after they showed-- well,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.240]   not more than a year.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.280]   Almost a year after they showed it at E3.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.480]   They showed it in June.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.760]   And in Japanese yen, it ain't going to be cheap $300.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.920]   Aqua Blue and Cosmo Black.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.240]   I don't know, Leo.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:07.880]   I don't know either.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.560]   I think too little too late, right?
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.720]   I was unimpressed by this thing.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   I'm pretty bearish on Nintendo, obviously.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.440]   But this-- I mean, this just seems
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.960]   like such short-term thinking to me.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   I mean, OK, yes.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.840]   They're trying to keep this franchise alive, right?
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.320]   Yeah, I'm totally willing to admit that the PSP phone that we
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.960]   saw leaked on a gadget was--
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.880]   it looks like a beard--
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.280]   Is that real?
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.080]   --crazy, Frank?
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.120]   It's got to be real.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   How could it be?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.680]   Well, I mean, you think about it.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.720]   You can't build portable gaming devices forever
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.280]   into the future.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.720]   People are just going to-- eventually, their tastes
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   are going to move to mobile gaming on your phone.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.760]   So really, the phone is the future of mobile gaming.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.600]   These are just stop-gap measures to try to hold on.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.280]   That's why I think it's short-term thinking is Nintendo
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.400]   doesn't know what else to make.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.240]   They only know how to make this one thing.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.560]   And frankly, if I were at the head of Nintendo right now,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.200]   I would be starting a pivot to making Nintendo--
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.720]   Phone.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.480]   --what could essentially be the biggest and most powerful game
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.920]   software company in the world.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   But as long as they're focused on building their own hardware,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   they're just going to be in nose dive position for those.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.720]   No, Kia made that gaming phone.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.800]   It was just a big flaw.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   Maybe it was--
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.160]   Oh, yeah, the end gauge.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.320]   Was that too soon?
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.640]   Was that too early?
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.480]   That's crap.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.280]   Well, that's another way of fun.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.400]   >> Pounds are not the future of gaming, Leo.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.920]   They are the present.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.800]   I mean, come on.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.760]   Bingo.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.680]   I carried around an iPhone 4 for a while, which I really loved.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.440]   And of course, I was doing a bunch of stuff with it.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.960]   Yes, I was playing games.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.720]   And I always remember--
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.960]   I think it was--
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.800]   I forget which Apple event where they position the phone
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.320]   and the iPod Touch, I think, as gaming devices.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.960]   >> Every event-- for the last two years, they've said,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.240]   it's gaming gaming games.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.840]   >> When they first did, I was kind of like, well,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.640]   that's presumptive.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.320]   I mean, how do they do that?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   And how do they do that?
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.560]   They have a library of 300,000 apps, many of them games.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.640]   Many of them, 99 cents are free.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.840]   Easy, super easy access.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.480]   You have to go to GameStop and buy something to put it on there.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.440]   You just pick it out of a library online.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.640]   You just download it to your phone.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.200]   You start playing it.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.400]   I saw the Nintendo 3DS.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.960]   I went to the event and I saw it.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.440]   And I was like, well, this is--
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.280]   I felt like I was looking at a technology demonstration.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:24.920]   Hey, look.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   They found a way to make 3D on a handheld device
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.200]   without glasses.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.440]   I just have to move this little thing to keep it in focus.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.840]   And then after that, I kind of forgot about it,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.000]   because I didn't see it as a practical device
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.480]   in any way, shape, or form.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.840]   And again, I go to my son, the most avid gamer in my house.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.640]   He has a Nintendo DS with the cameras.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.240]   It sits around most of the time.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.920]   He never touches it.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.480]   Lance, I think some of those things you pointed out
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   as advantages for phones aren't necessarily
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.320]   exclusive to a smartphone.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.920]   Things like digital distribution and cheap games.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.320]   It doesn't have to be a phone to do that.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   By the argument that all gaming will be going to phones--
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.800]   and I'm playing double that advocate here,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.320]   because I don't have a PSP or a DS.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.200]   But to say that all gaming will be on phones
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.760]   is to make the same argument that the iPad is
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   going to kill the Kindle and that we
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.560]   don't want single purpose devices.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:28.520]   I think the DS and the PSP, they have very good hardcore games.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.800]   But the problems there are that they're expensive.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   You have to go to the stores.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.200]   I mentioned Blizzard earlier for why they aren't developing
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.720]   for the traditional systems.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.920]   And the big reason they told me they're not making games
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.120]   for the Wii and for the DS is that the manufacturers
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.040]   build their business around charging royalties
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.600]   on each game sold.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.720]   And they're like, that's not fair.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.520]   I mean, Apple sells the same thing,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.000]   but somehow these game developers
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.400]   find a way to go for bulk and to sell at cheap prices.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.720]   So I think the distribution model could use some work.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.480]   But the phone is not necessarily going to kill these systems.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.640]   But it could--
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.280]   I thought--
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.880]   to say that single purpose devices are--
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.560]   because they are single purpose devices,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   they are therefore going to be the harbinger
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.200]   of the future of that show.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.920]   I mean, I don't know if that's necessarily true.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.320]   Kindle works, I think, one because it's really cheap,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.160]   because the content that you get on that
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.800]   is still digitally distributed.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.240]   And because it does something that the iPad doesn't, which
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   is, in addition to being way lighter and smaller,
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.920]   it's a far more effective ebook reader.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   Nothing else, right?
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.240]   Like reading books on it is everybody's--
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.920]   Yeah, I thought the iPad would kill the Kindle.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.440]   And I was obviously wrong when the Kindle--
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.880]   I mean, the iPhone can't do 3D.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.280]   The iPhone doesn't have dedicated controls.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.120]   So in some respects--
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.480]   In fact, that's not as good as it is.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.040]   If you have a phone, like the PSP phone,
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   that does have controls, I mean, clearly, the hardware
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.920]   is to the point now where it's every bit as good as the PSP,
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.440]   if not better, constantly getting better.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.720]   Storage is not a concern.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.040]   It's got connectivity where those other devices don't.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.840]   You're not going to see a 3DS with 3G.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.640]   So you're not going to be able to download stuff wherever
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   you are at a moment's notice.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.040]   I mean, if all we're really talking about is controls,
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.160]   that is a fixable problem.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.360]   That's not all we're talking about.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.040]   You guys have all said the same thing.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   The difference, the answer, is distribution.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.440]   You can hand somebody a beautiful piece of hardware,
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.320]   but if they can't get the software on it,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.400]   they can't get the software they want on it easily.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   The content they want on it easily,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.480]   it starts to devolve almost immediately.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.880]   It's always like, where are the apps?
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.520]   For example, the Palm Pre and the WebOS--
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.000]   fantastic platform, fantastic device, where are the apps,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.200]   where are the apps?
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.960]   Oh, sorry, we didn't get the SDK out.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.800]   Took them forever.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.320]   It almost destroyed that platform to the point
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.800]   that had to be sold off.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.320]   So that is the leg up that Apple has.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.920]   And that is also the leg up that the Kindle has,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   because gosh, it is easy to get another book on your Kindle.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.040]   You wrote a-- let's move on.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.720]   We're going to talk about violent video game.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.920]   Supreme Court is currently considering
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.160]   the California Adult Only Video Game Law.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   Trying to decide, as you say, Lance, in your editorial
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.320]   and PC magazine, whether video games are publications
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.400]   or creations of art, like movies and newspapers
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.720]   and protected by the First Amendment,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   or more like alcohol and cigarettes,
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.200]   something that minors have to be protected from.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.120]   Yeah, it's a tough thing, because I'm aware--
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.760]   there's a lot of gaming that goes on in my house.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.720]   I've seen it all.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.400]   I've watched my son--
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.800]   Do you like your sense 15?
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.640]   Do you let him play anything he wants?
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   Pretty much now.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.680]   It started.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.480]   We started very controlled, especially
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.040]   because he started gaming.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.600]   He was 8'9" and he was playing some of the games.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.560]   And what I remember, no exaggeration
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   when he first got his game cube, I picked up Rogue Warrior.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.080]   And I was afraid to let him play it, because he was like 8,
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.600]   and it was teen.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   And I was like, I don't know what's going to be on there.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.960]   It's stalwarts, but I don't know.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.200]   It's rated team.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.880]   So I played it.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.200]   There was nothing.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.080]   And then as he got older, Halo, the same thing.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   It was his first mature game, and I played it,
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.360]   didn't see anything, gave it to him.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.120]   So he's almost 16 now.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.000]   Obviously, knows a lot more.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.520]   But these games let you do all sorts of things, free play.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.080]   As I mentioned--
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.680]   I remember when Grand Theft Auto 4 came out, I told my son,
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.880]   OK, you can play it, but don't hurt anybody.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   Wander around, enjoy the game.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.800]   You could do some missions.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.480]   But can you not do any carjacking or beaten on people?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.160]   Yeah, it pretty much gets out of hand.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.320]   I stand over his shoulders.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.760]   I'm like, why did you shoot that person?
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.480]   He goes, what?
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.640]   He goes, it's a video game.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.280]   Like, he understands that.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.920]   I think there's people who are in the camp who
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.160]   say that young minds cannot differentiate
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.800]   between fantasy and reality.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.840]   And we'll start to think that they
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.640]   can act in the real world as they do in the gaming world.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.240]   I guess I'm on the other side of that.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.360]   I know that my son plays these games.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.840]   I know he does crazy things because the world's
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.640]   allow him to do that.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.320]   And then he just goes back to being himself.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.160]   I don't think it's going to make him a serial killer
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.560]   or a scumbag.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.080]   But I guess you could make the argument
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.440]   that it might desensitize you to violence.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.040]   And that's a really good question.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.360]   But I think our world made desensitize us to violence.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.920]   There's a lot going on out there.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.200]   I feel like video games are the least of our problems.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.960]   But the point is that California's got this law in the books.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.880]   It's up for the Supreme Court to decide whether or not
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.360]   this is a law that stays.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.200]   And I had the conversation with my family.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.320]   It's like, well, it's California.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.600]   What does that matter?
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.480]   But once they step over that threshold,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.600]   if California law stays, then say it's constitutionally correct,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.680]   other states will pass laws, similar laws.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.760]   And then the question you have to ask
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.320]   is now what else gets controlled?
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.200]   I still have the right to take my tween or even my child
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.360]   to an R-rated movie.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.880]   Because I know they're going to say the F word.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.120]   That's why they rated it R. But everything else is fine.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.240]   But do I have the right or will it become illegal?
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.520]   And that's my concern.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   And that's why I don't want the law involved with this.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.040]   This is always going to be about parental control.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.880]   It's always going to be about the conversation,
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.200]   how you stay in lockstep with your own child
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.360]   to know exactly what they're doing in technology.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   You guys agree?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.560]   Well--
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.640]   I don't have any kids, so I can't really talk
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.400]   or experience.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.360]   We have no idea.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   Come on.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   We don't want the government to say this is art, this is an art.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.160]   This is allowed, this is not allowed.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.080]   All you have to do is say, well, what if it were movies?
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.480]   Would you say that it's OK?
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.520]   Just as you said, Lance, for the government
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.360]   to say that you can't see this movie?
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:08.880]   No.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.120]   And you know, electronic arts made that same point
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.360]   in response to this legislation.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.640]   They had their blogger write this post saying,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.360]   you know what, the person primarily backing this
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.160]   is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is in some of the least violent
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.400]   movies of all time.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.200]   This is just bizarre.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.920]   You can watch him kill somebody,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.880]   but you can't act it out on a screen.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.080]   Yeah, I got to say, the industry's not
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.520]   doing itself any favors right now.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.520]   So we've got the electronic--
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.400]   we've got the ESRB who does the ratings, right?
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.120]   And they actually put a lot of detail
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.840]   on the back side of these games.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.440]   The front side, they all say mature,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.640]   so they're all seeing the same.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.040]   They're not the same.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.560]   But I went to games.com to just sort of see, well,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.800]   what is the real world out there?
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.160]   What are other people seeing maybe who aren't
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.760]   as familiar with the gaming world?
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.440]   And if you go in and you go into role playing games,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.000]   you see the very first page, the full first page of games,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.200]   all the most popular games, the games they're pushing,
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.320]   are the mature games.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.960]   Next page, most of them mature.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.840]   It gives you the sense that all the games are mature,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.920]   and it's kind of as gaming as this dark world.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.640]   And that's really not the case.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.520]   But good luck on GameStop finding an organization of games
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.560]   by rating.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.120]   They don't even show you that.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.880]   So why not make it so it's not so scary for these people
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   who are trying to legislate instead of have a conversation?
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.840]   Lou in our chat room said, playing too much Super Mario
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.040]   made him want to use shrooms.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.080]   I have a hard time feeling really strongly about this issue.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.640]   But not for the reasons I think most people--
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.040]   I think most people, especially kind of in our industry,
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.560]   have very strong feelings about this
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.520]   and kind of like how you became really animated right there.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.680]   I think my personal issue with this is just that I don't have kids.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   But if I did have kids, I wouldn't
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.320]   want them playing any video games at all.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.440]   I think there's a way too much of that in general.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.880]   People know the difference in cartoon violence and real violence.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.480]   Video games are not so realistic now.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.920]   They can't tell the difference.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.320]   It's not so much about that.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.520]   I just think that kids right now are really
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:23.280]   deprived of non-electronic activities.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.440]   But that's not as a general point.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   So are we.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   Or are we not?
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.600]   What are we doing?
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.800]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.840]   And when I was a kid, I did two things.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.040]   I read and I watched TV.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   That was what I was doing.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   Right.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.920]   There weren't really video games for me to play.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.200]   I was reading all the time or I was watching "I Dream of Genie" or--
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.680]   Would you prefer that your kids play a game than "Watch I Dream of Genie"?
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   What's that?
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.480]   Would you prefer your kids play the game than "Watch I Dream of Genie"?
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.840]   I mean, I think that's a false choice.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.280]   I would prefer they read a book.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   Well, OK.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.200]   But let's say they're going to spend some time on the screen.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.400]   Isn't it better that they actually be doing something, even if it's just video gaming?
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   I mean, maybe.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   I played a lot of video games as a kid.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.760]   And I don't really regret that, but at the same time, I do wish that I was outside more.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.440]   I do wish I read more.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.560]   Oh, this is really about you, isn't it?
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.720]   Yeah, it's about looking bad.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:22.040]   I wish that my parents had taken more interest to say, "Get off the video game and go read
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.960]   a book or go outside and play through friends."
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   And what would you have said?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.240]   I say that to my son.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   We have the conversation.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.280]   I go, "OK, you've been in the house now for three hours playing this game.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   Let's go.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.280]   Come on, get out."
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   A lot of times it's an argument.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.960]   I mean, I do try and drag him out.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.640]   I drag my daughter outside as often as possible.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.480]   But yeah, the lore of the digital world, the lore of the bits and bytes is so strong for
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   everyone.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   It's very compelling.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   It is very compelling.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.040]   And we get, you know, the other thing, and I don't want to go off on a really crazy tangent,
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.840]   but the socialization of technology is part of the reason that we're all spending so
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   much time on it.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.760]   So now everything we do, including gaming, you know, my son, when he plays on the Xbox
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.320]   360, is playing Xbox Live.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.040]   He's dealing with people all around the world.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   He deals with every day.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   He's dealing with his friends.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   He's talking to them.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   They're playing.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   They're actually in group games.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.040]   Yeah, but that's not socialization.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.800]   That's not socializing, is it?
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.240]   Well, it is to them.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.800]   It is to them.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   That's the thing.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   It's socialization.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.960]   The definition of it, I think, is changing.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.240]   But you know, every piece of technology we have has a social component now.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.480]   So we have heads down.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   We're not going outside.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.720]   We're doing these things all day long.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Well, it's not just the kids.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.800]   I mean, we're tweeting Facebook and...
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   That's right.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.240]   So I kind of agree with Ryan that too much of a good thing is still too much.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.320]   Well, I think we're all agreed though that the state or the federal government shouldn't
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.520]   be the ones who tell us go outside and play.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.760]   I know I am.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:56.560]   Paul Therat told me that when he got to 11 prestige and Call of Duty, Modern Warfare
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   II, the final achievement, or I guess he got every achievement and he got the final
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.360]   achievement said, "Okay, you're done.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360]   You got every achievement.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   Go outside.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   Play.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   You're done.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   Stop."
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   I don't think it worked.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.360]   But...
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.200]   Hey, no white iPhone.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.640]   Apple finally admits that for whatever reason they can't make a white iPhone, they say,
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.160]   "Sorry, we're not going to have one for...".
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.640]   Even though they promoted it, they talked about it.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.400]   Not till next spring, Ryan, you have any insight as to what happened?
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.360]   And nothing more than what's been written out there.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.720]   And there's been a lot of stuff.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   There was reports that...
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.840]   I mean, this is like the most minor of things.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   Just face it, but...
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   Yes.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   Yes.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   So, okay.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.920]   It might be worth a recap because there have been a lot of reports as to why it's not
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   coming.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.960]   One was that light coming in through the white casing, through the white film on the
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.520]   inside of the casing was interfering with the camera.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.080]   One is that they couldn't get the home button and just the right color.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.400]   One is that they couldn't get the paint for the white casing and just the right color.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.720]   There's just been a variety of reports.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   I don't really know what it is.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.320]   I don't even care, but I don't really care.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.200]   There are some people who are actually waiting for a white iPhone.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   That's the fun.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   I mean, keep waiting if you want.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.840]   At this point, I would just wait for the iPhone to be waiting for the iPhone to be
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   waiting for Duke Nukem forever.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.320]   So, some people just like to wait.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   That was really coming, man.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.920]   I think it's some combination of the magical part of the phone and white.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.120]   We put those two together.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.840]   It probably causes a black hole or something like that.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   There weren't enough unicorn tears to make it.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.840]   Yes.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.240]   You know, the really frustrating thing though is all these Apple employees happen.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.800]   Those are the phones that you could get as an Apple employee.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.640]   So, anytime I see a white iPhone and I do see them in San Francisco, you know that's
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   an Apple employee.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   Wow.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.800]   And a few people like the Walt Mossberg, I think, has one.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.400]   Somebody just said Stephen Fry has one.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.120]   So, there's a few special people.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.600]   Special people have a white iPhone.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   Steve's VIPs.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.400]   It's like having a black American Express card.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.560]   You know you're a special.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.400]   Bad Johnny, I've painted himself.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.720]   You know, you probably could paint it.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.800]   Isn't there that company that does console systems?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   It's going to get something called white nail polish.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   It's a white laminate.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   You don't have to paint it.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   White laminate, little Xacto blade.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   It done.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.240]   Or, you know, the plastic vinyl that they used to line drawers.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.040]   It's actually a good way.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.960]   Colorware might be a good way to do it.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.920]   I actually, so when the iPhone 3 and the 3G came out, I bought both of those in white.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.640]   But what I liked about it was that the back was white and the front was black.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.000]   And actually, I like that because even though you didn't really think about it, the front
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.880]   being black kind of hid all of the sensors on the front of the face.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.360]   It made a lot of the details and mechanics up there a little bit less obvious.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.200]   On the white phone, it looks kind of crazy because at the top, you've got the proximity
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.120]   sensor, the camera, the earpiece.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.640]   And the whole thing looks like a really old school iPod and not the best way.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:02.080]   And if you're watching a movie, the white tends to distract, tends to stand out.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   You know what I'm trying to do?
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   I didn't moan.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   I want to translucent.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.080]   I want to see through.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.080]   I have a watch.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.080]   This watch is see through.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.920]   You can actually see the inside of it.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   That's what I want.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.480]   Is that an Accutron by Bulova?
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.720]   Did you get that in 1974?
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   It's a Kenneth Cole watch, but it's not funny.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.920]   You can see right through it.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.960]   Remember that Bulova, they had the tuning fork in there and you can see the tuning.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   You can hear it.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   You can put it up to hear you.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.600]   You can hear that weird sound.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.280]   I'll tell you where I'd be really pissed off.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   And there's a lawsuit.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:37.200]   I imagine this will end up being a class action lawsuit about the iPhone 3G owners who upgraded
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   to OS 4.0 and basically it turned their phone into a turtle, into a just horrible useless.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.880]   And there's no downgrade.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.400]   Apple said they fixed it with a 4.1.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.440]   I don't see any evidence.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.680]   Wouldn't you be furious if you had a 3G and you upgrade?
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.360]   I see you guys, you girl, use an iPhone 4s or whatever, so you don't care.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.360]   But I just think it's terrible.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.880]   I gifted my 3G to my dad and he's having the same problems.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   I think it's awful.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.760]   I think Apple should be really censored over this.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   This is not good.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.720]   Well, there is the class action lawsuit that's been brought against them, so they'll have
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.520]   to explain this somehow and hopefully bring a fix.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   You know, on the one hand, they are supporting their phones further into the past than other
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   companies are.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.840]   They look at the T-Mobile G1.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.360]   They should push it on the update.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.360]   But they made them.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   Yes.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.960]   I mean, so you can update the G1 to Android 2.2, but Apple kind of pushed this update on
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   3G.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   No, I know.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   I agree.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.200]   I'm not giving Apple an out here.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.440]   I'm just saying, you know, again, on the one hand, they're supporting further into the
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.280]   past, which is a good thing.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   And they are the company who single-handedly said, "No, you are entitled to phone upgrades
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.240]   in the future, and you should be able to have the latest version of the operating system
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.320]   running on your older phone, and that shouldn't cost you any money, and that's not something
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.560]   that the carrier should be involved with."
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.960]   But on the other hand, they clearly haven't fulfilled that promise here.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:12.920]   I mean, they needed to devote the resources to the iOS team to make sure that 3G performance
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.440]   is good, and they have not done that.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.440]   All right.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.040]   I know they made that mistake.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   Go ahead.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   I don't know how they made the mistake.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.960]   I believe they said that this was something people could do.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.560]   And I guess, as usual, with software, when people put things on the phone, there are
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.800]   variables.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:38.320]   The thing about Apple sometimes in these situations is that they tend to ignore obfuscate whatever
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.240]   they can until they finally have to go, "Yeah, we made a mistake here."
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:49.400]   And when you have a very successful product like the iPhone 3GS, and you're going to have
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.880]   a lot of users who get very excited about the next thing, and then the features that
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.840]   you're going to get from this upgrade, and then you pump them in this way, you're going
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.200]   to have problems.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.640]   This is what was asked me.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.960]   We were talking about this on a radio show in Los Angeles.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.800]   The host Bill Handel, I said, "Well, he's a lawyer.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.120]   Did Apple do this on purpose to force people to upgrade?"
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   And I said, "Well, how do you know?
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   I don't know.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.120]   I don't think."
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   He said, "Is it relevant?"
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   He said, "Yeah, it's relevant.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.120]   It's hell yeah.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   It's relevant.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.560]   And the question is, is this kind of some sort of sleazy attempt to force people to upgrade?
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   I don't think it is.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   I know.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.680]   You know, there's that old phrase, "Never attribute to malice what can be easy to
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   incompetence."
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   That's stupid.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.280]   You know, this is just, I think they didn't just, they just didn't spend the time to get
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.760]   it right, and that sucks.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.960]   But, you know, I think there are a lot better ways to force people to upgrade to the iPhone
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.520]   4 than making the iPhone 3G run a little bit slower.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.680]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.280]   We're going to take a break.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:50.680]   We come to Microsoft and Google, Google, and a border dispute of all things.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   International dispute.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.640]   Before we talk about that, I would like to mention our friends at Audible.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:00.360]   These guys do such a great job of making audio books for everybody.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   What the heck happened there?
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.240]   Let me push that button again.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.680]   I was, sorry about that.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.160]   The lance, I didn't mean to turn you into an Audible ad.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.840]   If you're listening to a podcast, presumably you like listening.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.640]   Audible is a great way to get a lot more reading done.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.280]   You know, as we all get busy, this is what you were talking about, Lance.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.840]   We start, you know, watching more TV, working harder, and we don't have time to stop and
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.200]   smell the roses.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   Read a book.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   Audible.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   Hey, Rose isn't strong.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.800]   You have, are you smelling them?
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.160]   That's right, right now.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.240]   Right now, he's smelling the roses, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.040]   Audible.com gives you a chance to get, you know, read again.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.760]   I have to say, I am a huge fan of Audible.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.440]   I've been a member since 2001.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.280]   I've read over 400 books.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:52.000]   Those are books probably I wouldn't have had time to read if I had an actual paper book
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.320]   or even a Kindle book because I listen in the car.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.680]   I listen at the gym.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.880]   I listen when I'm doing housework.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.240]   I listen when I'm walking the dog.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.920]   I even listen in the hot tub.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   Oh, look, rendezvous with Rama.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.720]   One of the things Audible has done, they know that they, they know that a lot of the great
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.400]   science fiction classics haven't yet been made into audio books.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.800]   They just weren't made into audio books in the original form.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:19.440]   And so they have a program, they call it Audible Frontiers in which they record these great
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.440]   classic books.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:27.760]   Arthur C. Clark's absolutely wonderful rendezvous with Rama just came out on Audible Frontiers.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.680]   Now this could be your book free.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.040]   They also have childhoods end.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.360]   Now let's, let's do a two book deal because this is a good one.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:38.960]   If you haven't read childhoods end or rendezvous with Rama or you haven't read them in a while,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.720]   they're out now in audio and you can get them absolutely free.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:50.120]   If you go to audible.com/twit2audible.com/twit2, here's a little bit of childhoods and Eric
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   Michael's summer.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:56.640]   In the first year of their coming, the advent of the overlords had made less difference to
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   the pattern of human life than you were.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   I am.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   I respect it.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.880]   There's shadow in it everywhere, but it was an unobtrusive shadow.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.880]   Though there were few.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   Oh, is this a good book?
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.680]   And I won't tell you about that.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   Well I won't tell you.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   I won't spoil it.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.280]   Let's just say read this book.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.960]   You'd get two of them now audible.com/twit2.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.640]   What you'll be doing is sliding up for the platinum account.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.520]   That's two books a month, but the first month's free and you can cancel it anytime in those
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.240]   books or yours to keep forever.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.600]   Forever.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.280]   So audible.com/twit2 and that would be two great books, childhoods and rendezvous with
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.760]   Rama.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.120]   There are, there's other great stuff.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:37.280]   The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury also just came out now on, on audio.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.280]   Double.com, but it's not just science fiction.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.280]   It's nonfiction.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.720]   It's a current bestsellers.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:50.320]   It's Baba Buys biography by Gary Del Bathe.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.640]   If you're a Howard fan, you might want to hear it.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.160]   They call me Baba Buys.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.000]   I think I'll skip that one if you don't mind.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.080]   That's the point is everything is here.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.640]   My next read, by the way, Keith Richards life.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   I got it.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   I downloaded it.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.840]   Twenty three hours of and then Mick said to me, look at that bird over there.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.120]   I'm going to never mind.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.160]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.280]   They play on the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod of course on your zoom.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.760]   Android phones is a great app for Android and Apple phones.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.720]   It lets you listen to any of your iPod books and don't forget the big half off sale going
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.000]   on right now.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.080]   Audible.com/twit2 for your first two books absolutely free.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.440]   Then once you remember, you can go get the half price books.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.720]   We thank you for their support of this week and tech and the entire Twit Network.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.960]   So a little border dispute for Google.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.280]   Google says it's the US government's fault.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.280]   It's Google Maps.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   I never really thought about this, but when you start publishing maps, dude, you got a
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.400]   responsibility.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:53:02.000]   Wall Street Journal says that Nicaragua and Costa Rica are fighting over the border and
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:12.400]   a Nicaraguan commander justified a raid into Costa Rica by using Google Maps.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.440]   This is invasion by Googling.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.240]   The sovereignty apparently is in dispute.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:25.080]   Apparently, the foreign minister of Costa Rica has written to Google asking for changes.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:31.360]   Spokesperson for Google says, we got the data from the US government, but it's justification
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.840]   for you could have an international incident by following the Google Maps.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.320]   You know what I would do if I was Google?
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.080]   I would actually just take this area.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.920]   I would make a big, like, washed out.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   Yeah, blurry.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.160]   They just have no firm line.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.640]   Do what they do in Germany.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.560]   But the politicians sort it out.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.000]   That's what they did.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.920]   You can request in Germany to have your house blurred in Street View.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.360]   Jeff Jarvis calls it Blurmany.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:05.520]   The actual official policy for Google on Maps and Earth is to use red dotted lines for disputed
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520]   borders.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   Oh.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   So they may end up giving them a chance.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.320]   They don't come to a conclusion here.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.880]   They should have read Google News.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   Then they would have known it was in dispute.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   Or paying attention.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880]   See, that's the problem.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.720]   One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.720]   As usual.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.720]   It's all.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.760]   There's a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of data they got to manage and they are picking
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.080]   it up from sources.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.720]   And if your source is wrong, they're going to be wrong.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.520]   And the US government is not always up to date.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.600]   You want to talk about one hand not knowing what the other is doing.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.320]   All the data the US government has about various things is typically in stove pipes.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.600]   I mean, they don't share all that well.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.760]   So I'm sure if we look hard enough, we can find other mistakes.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.720]   Hey, they got hit with something different just this past week on Tuesday.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:55.440]   A fast company writer discovered that Google pointed him to the wrong polling place in
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   his neighborhood.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.000]   So he didn't get to vote.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Wow.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   That is correct.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   That is correct.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   They do they do that all the time.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.960]   Yeah, I started collecting stories from people about the various wrong directions they got
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.760]   from Google Maps.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.520]   One guy told me that he had to there was a truck.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.560]   He had a big truck and he was delivering something and he had to go through this path
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.160]   and there was a bridge.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.880]   But it was a bridge that was only big enough for a bicycle.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.200]   Well, how you know, come on.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.960]   Look out your window, dude.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.240]   So by the way, Microsoft was quick to point out that Bing got it right.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.440]   Oh, if they'd only followed Bing.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.680]   Well, it depends on his version of right is actually right.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   So that's right.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.640]   You know, I have a very hard time believing that Google is in any way responsible for
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   an international incident.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.400]   I mean, you don't think the people down there in Costa Rica and Nicaragua know damn well what
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.000]   the border is supposed to be saying that Google Maps was the reason why they invaded.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.240]   I mean, come on.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.240]   We weren't invading.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   We're just taking a trip.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.200]   It's a family trip.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   Please.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   No big deal.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.200]   Android turns three.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.080]   It's this week was his third anniversary of Android's release.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.920]   It took him a little longer to get a phone out.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.720]   The G1 didn't come out right away.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:20.680]   But on November 5th, 2007, Google announced the what they call an open handset alliance
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.040]   and an Android.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:30.880]   And now we're really close, I think, to version 3.0 Gingerbread should be out pretty soon.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.560]   Have any of you played with a Gingerbread Defonian?
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.800]   So it's on lockdown right now, isn't it?
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   I don't know.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   Anybody's really played.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.040]   They got the giant Gingerbread guy in the Googleplex.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.640]   And then you got honeycomb after that one.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:49.080]   I have a question for you guys about Gingerbread versus honeycomb because we've been discussing
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   this.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.680]   I've read some people saying it's designed directly, especially for tablets.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.840]   But then what's honeycomb?
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.000]   Because I actually thought honeycomb was the one that was designed for tablets.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.320]   And when I took to Lenovo, they seemed to be under that impression too because they basically
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.800]   wanted to wait for honeycomb before they made a Lenovo tablet.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   That's what I've been hearing.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.040]   The Gingerbread is not going to be tablet optimized.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.600]   And that honeycomb is going to be the one that's bad.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.600]   But they're just pushing tablets.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.840]   For all the people making Android tablets, I mean, a lot of them are running froyo 2.2.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:26.040]   Yeah, well, I mean, Google has been pretty active in discouraging people from putting
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.040]   Android right now.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.160]   Yeah, they said it's not our tablet operating system.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   It's not optimized.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.440]   It's not optimized for tablets.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   It's just not.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   They'll fix it.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   They'll get there.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.640]   It's just going to take them a little while.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:44.600]   I've gotten the impression from talking to some OEMs, including some of the guys at Samsung,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.240]   but they don't know what's on the roadmap for Android.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:54.920]   Samsung with the Galaxy S or the Galaxy Tab built out their own apps and they did their
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:00.160]   own customizations to make it look fine on a 7-inch screen.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:07.200]   But when I asked them about when they would be supporting this rumored Google tablet OS,
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:13.800]   I mean, maybe they were just being coy, but they seem like we'll work with them and we
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.760]   have in the past, so we'll just see what they come up with.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.960]   Yeah, I think it's more about plumbing.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.760]   With Android, Gingerbread, and Honeycomb, it's about the right plumbing for tablet functionality,
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:31.240]   for bigger gestures, for as many as like 10 fingers on the screen.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:35.560]   Everybody's probably going to build more customized interfaces for these tablets.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   But I think the big question for us is, what do we end up seeing at CES 2011?
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.800]   Will we see a lot of gingerbread tablets?
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.080]   Will we see a smattering of Honeycomb?
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.880]   Will we see all four of them?
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.880]   You can be so hungry.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   You can be so hungry.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.880]   Go with that.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   What's that?
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:52.880]   Nice.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.080]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.480]   Give me some chocolate now.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   It's hungry.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   I'm hungry.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.640]   So what do you think we'll see at CES?
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.280]   And has anybody played with the new Samsung Tab?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.080]   Take it away at it.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   It's slippery.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.080]   It's slippery.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.080]   Well, yeah, that's slippery.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   It's slippery.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.080]   It's slippery.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.680]   Does it work all right?
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.000]   2.2, the apps look okay?
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.880]   Do they scale well to that seven inch screen?
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   How's it work?
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.240]   They didn't have a lot of apps that were actually designed for the seven inch screen
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.240]   yet.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.720]   So I think that was kind of coming.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   It looked fine.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.240]   It was responsive.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.560]   It looked okay.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.240]   I felt like it showed tremendous potential.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.640]   But I'm not a tremendous fan of seven inch tablets.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.280]   I don't think that's the right size.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.840]   You agree with Steve Jobs.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.040]   It's not a good size.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.600]   Yeah, I've said all along.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.720]   I mean, in fact, I wrote a column that said a seven inch iPad is a stupid idea.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.640]   Well, Steve agrees.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.800]   Or he doesn't.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   It's hard to tell.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.720]   Sometimes when he says we'll never do that, it means they're working on it right now.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.080]   Why is seven not a good size?
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.080]   The iPad is what?
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.080]   10?
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   9?
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   Right, 9.7.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   Something like that.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   Almost.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.240]   And the kindles are sort of about six to seven inches.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.160]   I think that they're closer to book size.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.040]   I just feel like if you're going to go for a tablet, which is a fully a full function
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.280]   device, you want something big enough that you can put both fingers, both hands on the
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.480]   screen and type.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.560]   So it can be a productivity device.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.960]   You can show larger images.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.240]   You can draw on the screen.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.840]   You just get more done with a 9.7 inch that you do with the seven inch device, which kind
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.760]   of tries to split the difference.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   But you don't.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.440]   I just don't feel like you gain that much.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.120]   It was interesting that Steve Jobs did all that math with the amount of screen space you
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   actually lose.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.680]   Yeah, it's 50%.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   And that's a big deal.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.840]   So what can I say?
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.160]   I own both a Kindle and an iPad and I read on my Kindle and I do a ton of other stuff on
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   my iPad.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.840]   I would not be happy if I had to, for example, draw on just a seven inch screen.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.360]   I'm so glad they made it the size that they did.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   Have you seen the Dell?
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.200]   Now, the Dell streak is five inches, which I guess if seven is.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.360]   The Dell streak is so stupid.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:13.820]   We have the 10-inch unit in our office downtown and I can't figure out what someone would
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:14.820]   use it for.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.480]   And you know, they've put a decent amount into this Dell.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.200]   I mean, they have a stand at all the best buys, showing it off, like the multimedia
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.880]   magic of the Dell streak.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.600]   And I don't know what to say about that thing.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.800]   You think the seven inch screen size is not the sweet spot?
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   Try Dell streak sometime.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.040]   I'm glad that it will just, it will make you cry because it's too small to be.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.680]   It is a phone and it's too big for a phone.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   I love it for the whole thing.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680]   It's too small for this.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.600]   It is the sweet spot of suck.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.800]   I love the Dell streak.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.680]   Because when they're walking around, it looks like they just got something that's a little
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.760]   too big in their hand.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.000]   It's like something's wrong.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.400]   You've got a phone that's like swollen.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.800]   That coat's too big for that guy.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.200]   Well, it's not a great ad anyway.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.640]   It seems to be repeating itself.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.840]   What is going on?
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840]   Wow.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.080]   Yeah, that's really unpleasant, isn't it?
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.440]   See, there she is with her big swollen phone.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.360]   I don't know why it sounds.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   That sounds wrong.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.800]   Oh, you know why I opened like 18 copies of it.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   Look at that.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   Look at that.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   Oh, look at all.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   No wonder it's slow.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.760]   Okay, close, close, close, close.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   There we go.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   Thank you.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.360]   I'm about to turn into a pumpkin.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.080]   All right, Lance, Ulanov, anything you want to say before you go?
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   You know what?
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.640]   Stay tuned to PCM.com because we've got the best of the year coming up.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   Very big story.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.880]   We're going to name all the products we love from 2010.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.520]   That sounds great.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.080]   And Lance, come visit us.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.160]   We'll be at CES too.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.520]   And we'd love to do more with you at CES.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.600]   Okay, I'll see you guys there.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   That'd be great.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   Thank you, Lance.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600]   Ulanov.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.200]   Let's see this giant swollen phone ad here.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.120]   Oh my god.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   Everything looks wrong.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]   Everything looks wrong in this ad.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.320]   See how big that thing is?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   I don't know.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.160]   I like my droid X.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.160]   It's a 4-3.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160]   It's fine.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   You don't need to have done this.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   You don't need to have done this.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.280]   You should have done this ad what Apple did in the original iPhone ads, which was to have
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.920]   somebody with a giant hand holding the device to make it look hot.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.440]   So it doesn't look so big.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440]   That looks huge.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.200]   They needed giant hand models.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.440]   What they had there was people with regular size hands and a device that looks like it
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   is comically oversized.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   It looks like...
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.080]   But everyone wearing trench coats so that they could fit it in the pocket.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080]   Exactly.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   There really has to be real pockets.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.720]   They could slip it in their giant trench coats.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   It just looks wrong.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.920]   I think this ad is a mistake.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.960]   Although I wouldn't mind a big screen, I guess.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.800]   There's that point where it becomes too big and then it's not good for phones.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   Yeah, I haven't held it.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   So both of you agree.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.440]   This is a crappy idea.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.640]   It is not my phone.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.760]   I love a big screen as much as anybody.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.840]   I love the droid X.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   I love the evil.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840]   I think those phones are fantastic.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   So this is the best thing.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.000]   But those are really at the limit.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   This is as big as you can get.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.040]   In fact, that's what a lot of reviewers said.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.880]   This is as big as you can get.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.640]   Almost too big is what they say.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   Almost too big.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   Right.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   It really skirts that line.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.040]   You get any bigger and then it starts, the human anatomy starts, you know, conflicting
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.120]   with the device itself.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.000]   Do my hands look, I see they should have used me.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.680]   I have a, I could be a giant hand model.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.680]   Look at that.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.480]   Doesn't look so big.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.880]   No comment on that one.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.400]   I put it next to my head and I have such a massive melon that it actually looks like
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.600]   some pretty big mitts.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.040]   Yeah, I got big mitts.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.600]   Just an Leo.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:57.440]   So giant hand model or giant hand model giant hand model Google.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.160]   Google finally pulled the plug on Facebook.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.440]   Google saying, look, Facebook, it's a one way street.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.480]   We pump information into you and you don't give us any information back.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.200]   So finally they addressed this by changing their contact API so that Facebook could no
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.480]   longer scrape Google contacts for information.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:23.120]   Was this the right thing to do?
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:31.720]   I think Facebook, I think Google needs Facebook more than Facebook needs Google in that respect.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.200]   A lot of people have multiple email accounts.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.520]   Gmail users tend to be, this is a blanket generalization, but I would say like if you
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.280]   have at gmail.com, the end of your name, you're probably a little more tech savvy than someone
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.840]   who's still rocking a Yahoo or Hotmail account.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.320]   I would guess that the majority of those people already have Facebook accounts.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.120]   So this isn't really going to be hurting too many people.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.760]   So when you do the look for friends thing, it used to be you could supply your Gmail address
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.200]   on the look for friends thing.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:11.320]   If you swap these guys out in this situation and it was Google scraping or crawling through
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.800]   Facebook and Facebook shut them down.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.520]   I mean, I don't think that anyone would feel like there was some love loss there.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:26.000]   These guys have their data and Facebook, I think, is a little bit more stingy with that
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.080]   data than most.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.960]   If you look at Facebook's export tool, they just released that.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.560]   In terms of how long they've been around, they just got to this.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:41.240]   The last eight months, I think, or six months, that you could export all of your Facebook
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.520]   data.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.160]   To them, they really are like a one-way street.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.960]   They want everything coming into them.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.800]   It's how they want to build their own internet.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.120]   That's what it looks like.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:58.480]   These are most recent announcements for Facebook places and then the Facebook deals and even
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.960]   the new API where the location API, now you can write to it.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:07.720]   It's almost as if they're saying to Four Square and Goala and Yelp and Luke.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.560]   Yeah, just come on in.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   We'll be your big umbrella for location services.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.880]   You can use us.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.480]   Of course, Four Square is not going to say no.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.640]   They have to because so many of their users are.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.280]   Now, Four Square continues to grow.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.240]   I don't know if they have to.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:27.000]   Do you think it's a mistake for them to work with places?
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Do you think that they have to, though?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   I think they do.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.440]   I think they do because I think--
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.120]   Twitter didn't have to work with Facebook early on.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.320]   Twitter was able-- and granted, Facebook was not at the place that they are today when
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.920]   Twitter was getting started in 2006, 2007.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.880]   But Facebook was still really big even then.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   And Twitter did just fine not having to build everything off of Facebook.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   I guess you're right.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   I just think--
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.960]   Four Square is actually been a holdout on all of this.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:01.520]   For these new places announcements, they're saying they're not buying into the whole will
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.040]   completely write everything in.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.880]   I mean, you can post a Four Square check into your Facebook profile, but then that brings
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.360]   you back to the Four Square page.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.880]   So I think Four Square maybe will hold out for as long as they can.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:21.720]   So I got to tell you that the whole, like, when Facebook announced places and then they
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.600]   had Four Square go up and Four Square didn't say anything, I mean, they were there symbolically,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.320]   but they didn't have any announcements or anything of stuff, substances.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.600]   I mean, that actually spoke volumes to me.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:38.200]   They are at best uneasy allies, I think, you know, Four Square would be--
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.080]   Well, I'm sure they're uneasy.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.640]   Well, and even allies, I'm not even sure if I was really--
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.080]   Well, that would be really foolish, I think, to--
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.440]   Well, when you check in-- well, when you check in now on Four Square, if you use the
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.000]   Four Square app on Facebook, it'll show up on your Facebook.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.280]   And when they announced the fact that they now have a right API, I think Four Square was
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.440]   on that list of maybe that was fallacious, but was on that screen of logos of people
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.960]   who will be using the right API, which means you check in on Four Square and your location
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.400]   shows up now properly in Facebook, as if you checked in in places.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.400]   Sure.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.520]   So how much of your business do you want to depend on Facebook?
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.720]   I mean, do you want to be Zinga, where 99% of your business and revenue is based on Facebook?
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.800]   And then if Facebook pulls the plug, then you're basically dead.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   Well, you're right.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.400]   You don't want to, but you may not-- but you've also got to play-- it's a very interesting
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   game.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.200]   You've got to play this game, right?
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   And it's really tricky.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.560]   I mean, I see this all the time, and there are so many new startups that come up, and
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   they try to base all their stuff on Facebook.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.880]   And I totally understand why.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.200]   I mean, it's a huge opportunity.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.920]   But at the same time, it is the same problem that any company has when they are beholden
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.320]   to someone else's platform.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.480]   I mean, if you're going to be an iPhone app software developer, and that's all you're
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.520]   going to do, you know, huge opportunity there.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.800]   But if Apple decides that they don't like your app for whatever stupid reason, fair
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.440]   or unfair, you're screwed.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.640]   Your business is done.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:14.200]   So if Facebook came to GDGT and said, we would like to incorporate your have want pages
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.560]   somehow into Facebook, you'd still be a entity, a standalone entity.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   But we would just like to give you access to 500 million users.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.720]   Well, technically, I already have that.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.040]   I mean, Facebook is an open platform.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.680]   We have a Facebook app in so far as when you add a product to your want list, you can
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.880]   post that status update on to Facebook.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.520]   And there are also, you know, semi-open standards like Facebook's Open Graph Protocol, where
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:46.960]   if you hit a Facebook like button on a page, like a gadget page for the iPhone 4, whatever,
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.480]   it will show product data and stuff in your Facebook stream.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   So they're co-opting you.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.720]   I mean, you know, if you're a bot.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.440]   None of our stuff is dependent on that.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.040]   And if Facebook shut off the stream tomorrow, I frankly wouldn't care because none of my
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.520]   business is dependent on that.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.560]   But you know, if you're going to have a talk about like, you're going to have Facebook
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.200]   connect, you're going to have all those pipes into Facebook, aren't you?
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.040]   And that's the, you know, the risk that you take these days with, with doing a lot of
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040]   this integration.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   And it's, you know, it's tricky.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.360]   Like I get a lot of people kind of who think it's really weird that I have a web startup
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.840]   now where the only login mechanism is not Facebook, right?
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   Like you can log in with a gadget username or you can log into Facebook.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.480]   A lot of companies now, they just, all you can do is log into Facebook.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.960]   That to me is weird that Facebook would own your entire user set and that you wouldn't
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.040]   even be giving people the choice to not use Facebook.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.440]   Well, you wouldn't want that, obviously.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.320]   Well, a lot of people are doing that now.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.520]   And I think a number of new companies do that.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.720]   They just say, okay, Facebook, you're the login and identity system.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.640]   And that was what Facebook's announcement was this week was mobile single sign on.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.800]   Right.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.000]   So what, I agree with you.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.760]   Facebook is making a grab for the internet, essentially.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.960]   They would like it all to come through Facebook.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   More lots.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.880]   And it's a honeypot because if you, I mean, that's a half a billion users, they can offer
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.800]   you potentially.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.760]   And boy, we all know, I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the like button, it's
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.360]   much more successful than any other kind of social sharing.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.760]   I like button on your blog post is going to drive a lot of traffic.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760]   Is it not?
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.000]   Well, I think it depends on your site and your audience.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.520]   I mean, we get more traffic from Twitter than Facebook.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   Really?
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.360]   But I mean, you know, we're, we're also obviously a lot more geeky.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.880]   And I think that, you know, geeks tend to prefer Twitter to Facebook in general.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.040]   I mean, I know I.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.840]   Somebody, Jimmy in the chat room is saying like is the new link.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.680]   Ooh, I hope that's not true.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.280]   I would be very scary.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.160]   Well, I mean, Facebook strategy, there's not all that different from Google.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.440]   I mean, they're polar opposites of doing the same thing.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.880]   Google goes out and grabs everything.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.080]   And then Facebook just waits for you to come to them.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.840]   They're both still keeping records of everything on the internet.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.680]   It's just a different way of going about doing that.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:19.960]   Thomas is back in the news again.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.000]   So we had to take her to court and they keep giving her different awards and it goes on
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   more.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.360]   Well, on Wednesday, a federal jury said, Jammy Thomas, you owe $62,500 for every song you
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.480]   shared on the internet.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.520]   That's a total of $1.5 million.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.880]   This is the third jury to consider damages.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.000]   I don't know if it's over yet.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.720]   She says, I can't pay anything.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]   Zero.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.720]   You're going to get zero.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.160]   Yeah, I could look at that money.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.520]   Any amount I pay to them is money that I could use to feed my children.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.320]   Any amount I could pay to them is money I could use to clothe my kids and pay my mortgage.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.520]   So my kids have a place to sleep.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.680]   She's got a point.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   I'd like to know how they land on these amounts per song.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.840]   I mean, I saw the story that the judge was.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:17.400]   Well, yeah, the law says you can go up to 150,000 per song according to the story.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.080]   And I saw the the RAA was pushing for that.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.720]   And the judge said, no, that doesn't make sense.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:31.920]   But even $62,500 per song, I can't.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.960]   There is no song that takes that much money to create.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.840]   So what does that number mean?
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.480]   I mean, you could buy a Mac Pro.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.880]   You could buy the software used to create by all the instruments and it won't it won't
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880]   come up to $62,000.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.880]   That's great.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   What is that?
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.880]   There you go.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.520]   Trying to apply logic to the record industry again.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:15:00.760]   In 2007, the first jury, and this I thought was a travesty awarded the music industry $9,000,
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.800]   $9,250 a song, $22,000.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   The judge said, I gave I gave the jury incorrect instructions.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.400]   So another jury found a guilty again, then that they said 80,000 a song.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.480]   The judge said that figure is monstrous and shocking and reduced the penalty to $54,000.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.000]   The RIAA rejected that decision.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.120]   They said they'd settle for 25 grand.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.320]   She said, no way.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.360]   So trial number three, and now she owes one and a half million.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.320]   I just don't.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.920]   It seems like just is this the way to save the music industry really?
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   No, it's not.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.320]   It's it's they're doing it because it's symbolic.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.440]   They're doing it because that's the only stand that they have.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.880]   They're doing it to scare people.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.560]   They're hoping that you scare this and say, they're trying to make an example out of these
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]   people.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]   But you know what?
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.320]   All they're doing is demonizing themselves.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.960]   All that all this does is make me want to steal from them.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.320]   You know, it just makes me hate them.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.560]   It's it's it's it's a sick abuse of the system.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.080]   And and you know, look, they're they're going to get what's coming to them.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.320]   You know, they're already getting what's coming to the bomb went off 10 years ago.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.440]   And maybe the shockwave still hasn't fully hit them yet.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.640]   But you know, if these record label executives in the RA thinks that they're going to have
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.880]   a very profitable lucrative future, I'm sorry.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.920]   It's this particular case is a remnant of an old failed strategy from several years ago.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.280]   I mean, the RA isn't doing this anymore.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.120]   This was anyone that wouldn't go away.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   Okay.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.400]   What do they do now?
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   Now they go after.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   They go after the source.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400]   Yeah, I'm why.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.800]   And they and they put them out of business.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.320]   We're going to talk about a couple more things before we before we wrap this puppy up.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.080]   We've got Ryan Block here from gadget.com and their big event coming up Friday in San
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   Francisco.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.000]   If you just go to GDGT.com where you find out about that, Ryan.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.080]   Yeah, we've got a big banner up at the top.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.880]   If you're in the Bay Area, we would love to have you though.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   These are great.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.960]   Talking to you specifically, Lee, I know I'm in the Bay Area.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   I really want to go.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   I will.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.520]   I just try to make it up, but if not, you guys are going to be live streaming, which
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520]   I'm really excited about.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520]   We are.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.200]   We're going to broadcast it, but that shouldn't stop anybody from going.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.960]   In fact, if you go, you'll be on the live stream.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   So there.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.440]   Yeah, no, you're going to want to go because you're not going to be able to get everything
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.960]   that you're going to be able to get by being there.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.280]   I'm not just talking about like the shirts and stuff like that or the swag or the ability
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.720]   to win a ton of really awesome gadgets.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.640]   But I mean, you can actually go play with the gadgets.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:44.040]   Well, this is where you could see the streak if you wanted to, for instance, or no.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040]   No.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.120]   The streak is going to be there.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   How about the Samsung?
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.280]   Well, you have the Samsung tablet, the tab.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.160]   Yeah, Samsung should be there.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.600]   I don't know if they're going to be bringing the tab.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   Windows phone seven.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.720]   We can see the focus probably, right?
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.160]   Windows phone seven is going to be there.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.560]   Do you have one of those yet?
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.080]   Ryan, do you like that?
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   I do.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   I think it's actually great.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.080]   I think it's a really.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.040]   I'm going to have to wait in line tomorrow because no pre-orders for AT&T.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.920]   I don't know if it's the wait in line worthy phone of the season.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.320]   But it is definitely worth checking out.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.960]   Yeah, you might be by yourself out there, Leo.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   You think?
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.280]   I'll be the one guy in line.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.280]   You will be the line.
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.760]   Well, I better bring a camera.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.040]   Actually, you know, I was I waited in line for the Droid X and I got there early right
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   when they opened.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.040]   And it's a good thing I did.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.800]   I took me two hours to get the phone and people who came in an hour after they opened
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.720]   the doors couldn't get a Droid X for a long time.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.480]   There was a huge demand for that.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.000]   I phone quality demand.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.200]   You don't think that's going to happen with the Samsung focus.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   First of all, AT&T, which is.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.600]   Yeah, I think if it was on Verizon, there may have been more hype behind it.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.160]   But I kind of don't think this will be the type of phone that will draw huge crowds and
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.320]   stop shopping malls from opening.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.760]   Oh, well, I'll be in line.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.680]   I'll bring a flip game.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.240]   So we will talk about that.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.280]   It's kind of an end of the line for an American icon.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.320]   We'll talk about that.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   More to come.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.280]   And Steve Ballmer, cashing in.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.080]   Could it be the beginning of the end for the big B?
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.160]   More to come with our guests, Mark Millian from CNN.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.200]   I like saying that, Mark.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   Me too.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.160]   Sir Ring do it.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.640]   I like it when you say I think I'm going to make it my voicemail.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.880]   CNN's Mark Millian reporting in music to Myers.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   That's a really good idea.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.320]   Mark, hey Leo, can we get you to do our voicemail message?
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320]   Sure.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   I'd love to.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320]   That would be so awesome.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   I'd be like, you know, it's like, wait, wait, don't tell me.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   Yeah, Carl Castle does that.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   That's what you win.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.600]   You get Carl Castle doing your voicemail message.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.600]   Exactly.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.760]   I'll do that for anybody.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.160]   Carl Castle has to make a contest.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.840]   I'll do it at anybody who wants.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.240]   Before I do that, you're going to regret that.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.720]   They just create one of those flashops.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.480]   Like they did with the old Spice guy where you can go on and punch in your phone number
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.360]   and then it will assemble.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.840]   Hi, my name is Mark.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.920]   And this is my voicemail.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:18.120]   You just call 5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.960]   Before I do that, I do want to mention our good friends at Ford, the folks who make the
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.840]   incredible Ford Sync we talk so much about.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.120]   I'm driving and every day I drive my 2010 Mustang and I love the Sync.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.840]   But the other day when I was at Blog World, I drove the Ford Edge and now my wife is killing
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840]   me.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   She says, I got to have an edge.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]   I said, just bought you a car.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   I wanted an edge.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.840]   I wanted an edge.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.520]   It's the most high tech Ford out there.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.200]   It grabs attention as well as it grabs the road.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.280]   Let me tell you, beautiful, swoopy, doopy.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   Look at it.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.280]   The beautiful lines of the edge.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.320]   But when you get inside, you just get this feeling, the fit, the finish, solid, beautiful
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   instrument panel.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.480]   It looks actually kind of like my Mustang.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.960]   Obviously influenced by it.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.360]   The center stack, the door trim.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.240]   And of course, my Ford Touch, which puts two screens behind the wheel and then another
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.040]   big screen in the center console.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.200]   Oh, I was just talking to somebody who got an edge.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   They tried a lot of cars.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.360]   They said, why did you get the edge?
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.800]   Just tell me because I'm going to be talking about this on Twitch today.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.080]   And they said, the legroom and the second row.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.280]   We tried them all and it is the most comfortable in the back row.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.480]   The available automatic vista roof for the front and the fixed rear skylight for the
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   back.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.400]   So everybody gets to see the stars.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.880]   Ambient lighting.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.880]   The 2011 Edge has incredible V6 highway fuel efficiency.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:37.120]   The advanced three and a half liter TI/VCTV6 engine.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.800]   The TI/VCTV4 horsepower.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:46.000]   But unsurpassed fuel economy in the Class 27 highway miles, E.P. estimates per gallon.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.840]   Then there's the sport model with 305 horsepower, 280 foot pounds of torque.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.120]   I don't know what that means, but I know it's good.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.960]   280 foot pounds of torque.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.760]   I might make that my handle on World of Warcraft.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.760]   Hi.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.920]   I'm tanking today.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.360]   I'll be 280 foot pounds of torque.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.120]   Also sport tune suspension, the 22 inch polished aluminum wheels.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.120]   It's just great.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.240]   The eight inch touch screen, the my Ford touch.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.280]   If you've used sync before, you'll know how great it is.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.680]   If you haven't, you just have to try it.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.680]   What do you here's what you do?
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.760]   You go, I got to warn you, you're going to fall in love with this vehicle.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.280]   You go to your Ford dealer.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280]   You drive one this week.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   Take it.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.720]   Say, I want to see the new 2011 Edge and I want to try the Ford touch.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.640]   So you've got this two screens, right?
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.600]   The left screen can display and you could switch through it or by voice you could tell
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.880]   it what does display.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.640]   Fuel economy, mechanical status, settings and information.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.000]   On the right, actually I saw a techometer too.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   So I think it does a techometer.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.080]   On the right, audio and entertainment, climate control, phone communications available navigation
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.560]   and then you have the eight inch screen in the center stack that's like the map and the
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.160]   oh man, I love it.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.920]   You really feel like you are connected.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:00.520]   And this one now has two USB hubs and an SD card slot.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.600]   Isn't that great?
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.000]   Your car has an SD card slot.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.400]   RCA Jax too for AV input.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.760]   It's got the mobile in car Wi-Fi hotspot capability.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.040]   You could either install an air card through the USB or a broadband modem.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.280]   It's got phone book contact photo download.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.320]   I mean, it's just amazing what this will do.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.720]   So when somebody rings a picture shows up, I love that.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.400]   Drive one this week at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.840]   It's the most technological car Ford's ever made.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.880]   I think I'll be getting one.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.560]   I have to say, I know I'm going to be getting one.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.160]   My wife is going to make me get one.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.600]   Mark Millian is here from CNN.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.880]   The world's most important digital network.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:50.360]   And from gadget, Mr. Ryan Block, Balmer sells a big chunk of stock.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.400]   Now Steve Balmer is the number two shareholder at Microsoft.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.600]   Bill Gates has a little more than 7% of Microsoft.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.600]   Balmer has a little more than 4%.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:04.600]   Now that 4% that Steve Balmer has of Microsoft is worth based on the most recent stock price.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.640]   Let me get the exact amount.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:12.600]   He's got 4.2% of the company, $9.6 billion.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.840]   So he sells a little bit.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.760]   Sells 12% of his stock, his stake in Microsoft.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.800]   That's worth, he's got a billion, one in the third billion dollars.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.200]   And he said, "Is for tax planning and investments?
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.520]   I want to diversify my investments."
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.000]   But some say this may be an indication that Balmer might be moving on.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.960]   What do you think?
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.360]   I don't know about that.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.600]   I mean, maybe he's just got something personal going on.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.640]   Maybe somebody's family is sick or he's buying a house or something.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.440]   He wants to build a pool.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   When someone gets sick in my family, I go and I take a billion dollars out of family.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   It's only 12% when I'm buying a new house, a billion dollars.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640]   It ends up--
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   It ends up, yeah.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   Well, I know what kind of salary is he getting?
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   He could be doing something similar to that.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.640]   There's a $1 salary as the job is pulling for a while.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.120]   No, actually Balmer gets paid an actual salary.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.120]   He does.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.240]   Remember last year he got that, he had his budget, no, I'm sorry, not his budget, but
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.040]   his bonus slashed heavily.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040]   Right.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.200]   Because of their failings and mobile.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.200]   But they still gave him the gold underwear.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   Right.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   Well, there you go.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.560]   You had to make up for his bonus with these stock options.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:32.040]   If I were Balmer and I were thinking about leaving, I would actually not be taking a
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.800]   lot of stock off the table right now because the next guy is surely going to do a better
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.040]   job and is surely going to raise the fuck.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.000]   Now's the time to hold on to that, Steve.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   Exactly.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   Retire and hold on.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.400]   Yes, if I were Steve and I were leaving, I would be keeping my money in the company.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.560]   Boy, you guys are both bloggers.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.320]   This story just blew my mind.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.280]   There's a print magazine called Cooks Source.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.120]   I've actually bought copies of the magazine.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.520]   It's a cooking magazine.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.440]   Apparently, this magazine has some bad habits.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:12.320]   A blogger who wrote a blog five years ago for a blog called Code Cookery says they stole
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.720]   her post and put it in the print magazine without telling her the magazine has a circulation
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.520]   of 20,000.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   She said, "This is news to me.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.520]   I'd never even heard of the magazine."
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.320]   So the blogger Monica Gaudio contacted the editor of Cooks Source.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.320]   I wish Lance were still here.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.080]   I'd love to hear his opinion on this.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:37.240]   To ask about the article, it was a history of apple pie and how it got in the magazine.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.160]   At one point in the exchange, Gaudio said, "The editor asked her, 'What do you want?'"
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:48.040]   Gaudio said, "I want an apology in the magazine on the Facebook page and I want 130 bucks
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.000]   that you're going to donate to the Columbia School of Journalism."
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.800]   Ten cents a word.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:58.280]   The editor who said that she has three decades of experience editing for the Village Voice,
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.360]   Connecticut Woman Magazine and other publications, responded that, "Everything on the web is
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.800]   considered public domain.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.880]   You should be happy we didn't just lift your whole article and put someone else's
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   name on it."
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:16.400]   And she said the article was in very bad need of editing and it's much better now than
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.400]   it was originally.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.000]   In fact, we put so much time into rewrites, "You should pay me."
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   I'll say, "I'll take her all this is down."
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.640]   It wasn't that well-rigsy.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.560]   Is that creepy or what?
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.520]   It's just hilarious because there's just nothing right about it.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.840]   It's almost cute how naive it is.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   But that's great because it's just lately naive.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.560]   It's just like so wrong.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.480]   And I never heard it.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480]   What's this internet thing?
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.200]   Because of course, immediately, Gaudio goes public.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.280]   Yeah, and in conclusion, the sun wraps around the earth.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.760]   Yes, the earth.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.840]   It's the center of the universe.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:58.920]   So apparently, the Facebook page has been flooded with thousands of derisive comments.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.280]   The original page was hacked.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.400]   The magazine's forced to relocate.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:10.680]   If you look on Twitter on the hashtag, not Cooks Source, but Cooks Source, you'll see
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:15.440]   millions of tweets excorating the magazine.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.520]   I mean, they probably got more attention than they've ever had before.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.280]   I mean, this is like...
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.360]   So anyway, just you can't do that, folks.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.840]   And by the way, everything on the internet is not public domain.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:38.280]   Back in the early days, then, Engagit, it always surprised me how many people go out
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.960]   of their way to lift content.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.520]   Even when we were really small publication, it was just constantly happening, especially
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:50.640]   because of RSS, because RSS makes it incredibly easy to steal other people's content.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.840]   And so that was happening all the time.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.360]   And it would show up in places you would never believe.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.880]   I mean, it was never like it showed up in established publications or whatever.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:07.000]   But places where you wouldn't expect it to go that didn't seem incredibly shady, and
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   this is a pretty good example.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.280]   I mean, there were a lot of instances.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.160]   This is a legitimate magazine, you see.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.640]   Yeah, it's very, very, very weird what people think about these things sometimes.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.720]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.320]   There's not a lot you can do about it, unfortunately.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.480]   I mean, you can't have somebody arrested for that, right?
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.360]   I mean, you can file a lawsuit if you really want to, but have fun with that.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.320]   So I think this is a watershed.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.800]   Verizon is going to say, I've wanted this.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.400]   Who uses the yellow pages?
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:36.880]   Who uses the white pages?
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.600]   You still get it every year, dropped on your doorstep.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.760]   I recycle it immediately.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:48.080]   Verizon is finally stopping distribution of the white pages in Pennsylvania.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.640]   They actually had to ask permission of the state public utility commission.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.280]   Verizon says, if a customer specifically requests one, they can get it.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.280]   And that's fine.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.680]   There are probably some people who don't have internet access or whatever, and they may
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.040]   need a phone book.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.600]   But why print a phone book for a million people?
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.240]   Does anybody even use the phone book?
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:11.840]   They say, this will save 2,200 tons of low grade paper, 12 million books they used to
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.840]   distribute.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.760]   And they cited a Gallup poll in 2008 that said only 11% of households still looked up numbers
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.840]   in the phone book.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.160]   I'm surprised that state still, the phone company still do this.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.000]   There's a business there.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.160]   Well, the yellow pages, my mom still uses the yellow pages.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.800]   She doesn't use the white pages, but I gave her an iPhone and she still uses the yellow
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.600]   pages to look up local businesses.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   Really?
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.480]   It's a nice hard course of habit.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.400]   Your mom's thinking a lot of people also forget.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.600]   By the way, I just want to point that.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.760]   The thing that a lot of people also forget is that there's a big business there for local
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.080]   businesses who are not tech savvy.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.360]   And it drives me crazy to think about this.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:58.520]   But there are actually a lot of companies out there or retail places or food establishments.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:04.120]   A lot of local businesses that just don't know or understand how easy it is to put yourself
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.920]   as an official listing on Google Maps and on Yelp.
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:13.680]   And they will talk to my massage therapist and she's paying $39 a month to not be in
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:17.280]   the yellow pages, but to be in yellowbook.com.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.280]   That's terrible.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.280]   And I said-
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.480]   But it's the service, right?
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.600]   It's the service they offer.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.480]   You call them, you say, please list me and they take care of it for you.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.680]   But I asked her, I said, when's the last time, if you were looking for something, when's
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.200]   the last time you went to yellowbook.com, I said, how do you find something?
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.440]   She said, I Google it.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440]   I said, well, okay.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.720]   And then I showed her Google Places.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.280]   It's absolutely free to put a listing into it.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.600]   I said, please just do this.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.760]   Don't, it's 39 bucks a month.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:43.760]   It's free.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.320]   And this is where people go nowadays.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.680]   They look on Google.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.280]   Now you should have a Google Places directory listing.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   I mean-
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.880]   Yeah, I think it's the service, right?
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.800]   It's that they will place it for you.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.080]   They will list it for you.
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:01.360]   So I actually think the opportunity here is as long as the difference between these two
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.600]   businesses is that somebody is going to place your business in the listings, in the local
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.960]   yellowbook, or I guess in yellowbook.com.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.760]   The opportunity for Google is take care of it for people.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760]   Right.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:20.560]   Or offer for a $30 or something to create that verified listing in Google Maps.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.400]   Do it for them.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.400]   And there's Google makes some money and people get it in the place that people are looking
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.880]   for stuff now.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:33.560]   If you search for Twitch, I think you can find us on Google.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:38.320]   Actually, I think maybe Twitch, LLC, would probably find us on Google Places.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.840]   I'm looking right now, actually, and I don't see it.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.440]   But I know, I know, you know, they send you a postcard.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   Oh, I found it.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440]   Did you?
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.960]   They send you a postcard to say, are you really, you know, is this you?
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.640]   They've got nine five star reviews.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.360]   Isn't that great?
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.760]   Leo LePort's house, Petalume.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.760]   How do you know?
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.240]   Yeah, you got a nice pattern.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:06.240]   Then somebody did that too, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.240]   Let's see.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   Okay.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.240]   What is now?
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   This is good.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.000]   I got two guys on who can tell me the definition of 4G because wireless companies particularly
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   Sprint, a little up in arms because T-Mobile is saying our HSPA plus, well, that's 4G and
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.960]   Sprint saying, no, it's not.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.840]   So what is 4G?
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.240]   Is T-Mobile allowed to say that they're upgraded HSPA, which is three to five megabits, which
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.560]   is about as fast as Clearwire is.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.040]   Are they allowed to say that's 4G?
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.040]   What makes 4G?
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.440]   Mark, you want me to take the swimmer you want to take the swimmer?
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.360]   I think we'll double team it.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.360]   You can go first.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360]   Okay.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.360]   So 4G.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.360]   Okay.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:51.040]   So the whole G thing that is terminology and it's determined by the ITU, the international
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040]   television.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040]   So there is an official definition.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   Yes.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.400]   It's still being determined actually.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.800]   They haven't worked out every single part of the spec yet.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:06.240]   But 4G was originally intended to encompass wireless broadband and wireless phone networks
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.480]   that operated at 100 megabits or above.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.480]   100 megabits.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:10.480]   Yes.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.480]   So that is the actual technical definition.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.360]   Nobody's doing that.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   I know.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360]   Exactly.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.440]   We'll get to that in a sec though.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.440]   Okay.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.600]   So the ITU determines these.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:26.520]   3G is different than 2.75G and 2.5G, which are, we don't have to get any of that stuff.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.600]   But anyway, you know, the point is 4G is a thing.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.600]   It is defined.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:39.160]   It is not necessarily specifically LTE or YMAX, although those, they're a lot of standards.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.160]   Those are typically six.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.640]   You know, 802 was 802.16E, which is the original YMAX standard, you know, was considered to
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.480]   be a 4G standard by the ITU.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.120]   But the point is it has to operate at 100 megabits or above to be considered 4G.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.600]   If it doesn't do that, it's not 4G.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:00.000]   So what you actually have is these quote unquote 4G standards like LTE and YMAX, which
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.760]   are theoretically capable of operating at well above 100 megabits, but that are actually
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.440]   like way, you know, downclock, so to speak, there, you know, down in the zero to 10 megabit
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   range.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.560]   So, you know, there are 4G technologies that are not being used at what are supposed to
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.920]   be 4G speeds.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.800]   So for anybody to claim that 4G is a little bit disingenuous right now.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800]   None of it's 4G.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   Right.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.600]   So to Leo's original question, to your original question, can TMO will call their network 4G?
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:33.520]   Yes, they can because Brent started it and they had technology that, you know, isn't
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.640]   close to the standard of 4G.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.960]   Verizon's LTE is not 4G, like Ryan said.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.360]   From my understanding, I just did a story about this about a week ago.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.160]   I talked to an analyst at Gartner.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.040]   And from my understanding, a lot of the slowdown is on the end of the fiber that they're using
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.800]   to connect to these cell towers.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.040]   There a lot of the internet in this country is not fast enough to reach 100 megabits.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:00.880]   They can't get a call that's fast enough.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   Right.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.240]   So I mean, 4G is a marketing term.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.320]   So AT&T, you can say they have 4G.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.040]   They're rolling out an HSPA plus network eventually.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   So.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.840]   Well, see, TMO does actively advertising America's largest 4G network, which I imagine is kind
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.360]   of stunning a few people like to who TMO will.
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:28.280]   Well, you know, it's tricky because they do have a large network rollout based on, you
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.840]   know, current technologies, not based on Wi-max or LTE, but based on current technology.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:34.040]   But current technologies are as fast as.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.040]   Yes.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.760]   And then they're operating those technologies at speeds that are the same speeds that is
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.480]   what friends operating, it's Wi-max network at.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.320]   So it's really weird and kind of convoluted.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:57.000]   But in a sense, if you consider sprints 4G rollout, you know, 4G, then you could also
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   consider TMO's rollout 4G.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.800]   But it just like, it just doesn't make any sense.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.800]   It doesn't matter.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.960]   What matters is, can you get fast speeds and do you have coverage?
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.240]   And I think that there's just a lot of confusion with this, especially because, you know, you
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.160]   look at AT&T, AT&T was, you know, one of the first carriers to roll a HSPA, which is,
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.920]   you know, a speed increase to its network.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.920]   And that's great.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.600]   So AT&T now is a faster network that you can't use still.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.600]   You still can't use it.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.600]   So.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:25.600]   It's faster.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.600]   It's really not.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.600]   It's like, can you use it?
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.600]   Right.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.600]   That is what matters.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.680]   It's a great location and that has a lot to do with the available amount of spectrum.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.640]   But I mean, it's all just junk, this 4G stuff.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.480]   Sprint, from my understanding, used 4G as an internal term because YMAX was their fourth
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.520]   generation of technology that they were using at their network.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.800]   And then they came to the realization, whoa, let's just use this out of marketing term.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   It sounds cool.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.320]   It's one better than 3G.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.760]   I've been underwhelmed by YMAX by Sprint's 4G every time I've used it in Vegas and other
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.760]   places.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.000]   It's been like, okay, not much faster.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.280]   I'm not blown away by it.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.160]   But maybe that's, again, maybe that's the backhaul.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.200]   Maybe that's not the technology.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.200]   I don't know.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:16.360]   Yeah, it's going to be a while before it really starts to feel the way that it's supposed
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:17.360]   to feel.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.760]   Do you guys have a bet on 4G as LTE?
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.440]   Going to be the wave of the future?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.640]   Is it going to be the fastest?
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   Any thoughts?
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.640]   Absolutely.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.640]   LTE is, I mean, it's already basically.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.640]   This is Verizon's solution.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.640]   Verizon and ATD.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:29.640]   And ATD, right.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.640]   So you have the two big and big and big and big.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.160]   The one cell characters in the country behind that one.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:36.640]   And a lot of them internationally.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.440]   The one thing you won't hear about in these T-Mobile America's largest 4G network commercials,
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.000]   you'll hear about speed, but you won't hear about latency.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.600]   And latency is very important if you want to use this high speed connection for things
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.600]   like gaming.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.520]   If you don't want.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:58.480]   Connection delay between hitting the button to fire the gun and that actually registering
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.760]   with another player.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.920]   It is national.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.560]   Our last story and then we'll let you all go.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:11.760]   Jimmy Kimmel has announced National Unfriend Day.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.960]   And by the way, on the video on YouTube, it says, "Follow Jimmy on Facebook and Twitter."
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.960]   Naturally.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.160]   Don't unfriend him, apparently.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.360]   That would be the wrong thing to do.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.400]   I guess I'm going to get this band from YouTube by playing in here.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.080]   Here's something I've given a lot of thought to lately.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.080]   Friendship.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.360]   Friendship is a sacred thing.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.040]   And I believe Facebook is cheapening it.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.040]   I go on this Facebook.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.080]   I see people with thousands of what they call friends, which is impossible.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.640]   You can't have a thousand friends.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.520]   Here's how you can tell who on Facebook is really your friend.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.920]   Let's say on Friday, post a status update that says, "I'm moving this weekend and I need
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920]   help."
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.760]   The people that respond, "Those are your friends.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.160]   Everyone else isn't."
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.680]   I would like people to start whittling this down.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.680]   Here's an example of someone who has 545 friends.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.200]   Her name is Gina.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.640]   Every five seconds, Gina has something to say.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.400]   100 degrees in San Diego.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.400]   Ugg.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.360]   Gina is eating other people's food.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   Coffee.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.600]   Gina is watching weeds.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.480]   I'm feeling bad for this woman.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.840]   I hope he asked her permission.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.320]   I'd be watching Oprah right now.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.200]   Yay, my weekend just started.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.240]   Robin thickened mashed potatoes.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.240]   Hauler.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.480]   And the time please change already.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.960]   Who might have come between a girl and her nose?
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.440]   It's November yay and cinnamon hazelnut.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.280]   This woman cannot possibly have 545 friends.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.520]   If she has five, I'd be shocked.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.400]   So I say, unfriended.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.520]   Unfriended Gina.
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.760]   Unfriended all the genas of the world.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760]   They're not your friends.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.680]   Tonight I'm planning to launch a new holiday.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.520]   Two weeks from today, November 17th, we'll hear to four be known as National Unfriende.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.520]   Unfriended.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   Unfriended.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.520]   Unfriended Gina.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.320]   I encourage you to cut out some of the friend fat in your life.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.960]   A friend is someone you have a special relationship.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.840]   It's not someone who asks which Harry Potter character are you.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:13.480]   So I remember five years ago when no one was on Facebook and he didn't know what the
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.000]   guy you took high school biology with was having for lunch.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.520]   Remember how that was fine?
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.520]   Let's go back to that.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]   National Unfriende.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520]   No.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   And you did.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.520]   It's got a good acronym.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.520]   For more on National Unfriende, here's William Shatner.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.520]   Oh dear.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:36.520]   This is what I meant to show.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.760]   The law I'm going to reshatner.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:48.760]   These people on Facebook, they're not your friends.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:56.720]   That's the best part.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.200]   I don't know what was going on.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   What did he say?
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.840]   His name was Windamer Shatner.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.200]   I don't know when you're Shatner.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.680]   Shatner's got to be all about Twitter now.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.280]   It's paying the bills for his TV show.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.080]   Yeah, no kidding because he's doing the-
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.560]   Well see, how do they build the bills?
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.280]   They build that because you can't say my dad says on TV.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]   What do they do?
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   What do they call it?
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:38.060]   They call it, "B
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.860]   So we're going to- Wednesday we got our signature interview.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.860]   I just want to give you a little plug.
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:43.660]   We're going to be talking to Michael- Michael Geist.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.660]   Now here's a guy in Canada who revealed for the first time ever the terms of the ACTA
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:48.660]   treaty.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:52.540]   He's really- he's on the forefront of electronic frontier.
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:55.100]   We'll certainly talk to him about the Jami Thomas thing.
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.900]   He's been very active in recording industry issues.
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:02.060]   He's his attorney, teaches in Canada and we will get Michael Geist on.
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.780]   That's four o'clock Pacific time, seven o'clock Eastern time live.twit.tv.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:07.980]   Tom Merritt and I'll interview him.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:08.980]   We're looking forward to that.
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:09.980]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:16.180]   We do want to ask our Twit listeners to help us put together our holiday shows.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:21.940]   We are asking for the best clips, the best parts of all of the shows, the parts you like
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.860]   the best.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:25.740]   We will do a cut down for holiday a week.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:34.580]   If you go to twit.tv/bestof, twit.tv/bestof, you could tell us which of the shows you're
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:38.980]   talking about, what your favorite clip was.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.620]   Mike Break Weekly, this week in Google Windows Weekly, your tech news today.
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.740]   We're going to put together a kind of a best of show so that we don't- these guys don't
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:47.900]   have to work on the holidays.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:48.900]   Help us do that.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:49.900]   Best of Twit, 2010.
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.900]   Go to twit.tv/bestof.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:57.140]   Ryan Bloch's party is in San Francisco on Friday.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.820]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.060]   Come on out.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.300]   Open to the public.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.540]   Everybody's invited.
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:03.540]   Free pretzels.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.540]   I don't know.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.100]   I've paid that up.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:07.740]   Free pretzels on Leah.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:12.180]   I'll bring a couple of boxes of pretzels.
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:13.180]   That would be on me.
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.820]   Seriously though, if you're over 21, we're going to have some free drinks for people.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:19.820]   Now, how do you have a sponsor that does that?
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.820]   How does that work out?
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.220]   No, we pay for a lot of the stuff ourselves.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:29.540]   But, I mean, all the companies who we invite out, they help us pay for the show.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:32.540]   They know you're going to get an audience of gadget freaks who are going to be there.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:36.140]   So, they're really happy to be there and be part of that.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.940]   Yeah, it's going to be great.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:41.180]   I mean, we've done a bunch of these shows.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.180]   Normally, we get about 25 or so companies to come out.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.660]   This time, we've gotten 50 companies.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:47.660]   You got everybody.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:49.540]   It's like a huge margin, our biggest and best show.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.540]   That's going to be fun.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.140]   You can RSVP on Facebook.
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.740]   Don't unfriend them yet.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:57.260]   You don't have to RSVP on Facebook.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:00.140]   November helps us to kind of know how many drinks to buy.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.700]   So, right, November 12th, 7-11 PM at the, oh, I've already been invited.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700]   Veronica invited me.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:11.900]   I didn't even see that at the Galleria 101 Henry Adams Street in San Francisco.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:15.380]   And now, Mark Millian, you live in San Francisco, so you can come too.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.380]   I'll see you guys Friday.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.220]   I'll buy you guys a beer.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.980]   You're part of the, it's an open bar, right?
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:22.980]   Part of the, yeah, right.
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:25.780]   You buy him a beer.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:28.380]   You can fetch me the beer that Ryan has bought at me.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:29.380]   Exactly.
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:31.780]   All right, we'll see you out there.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:35.100]   Anything you want to plug, particularly Mr. Millian?
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:36.100]   CNN.com/tech.
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   That's it.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.100]   Go there.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:41.740]   He lives there and you're happy to be in San Francisco?
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.540]   Yeah, and I'm loving it.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:48.180]   It's raining this morning, but it's nice out now and public transportation is good, unlike
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:49.180]   LA.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:50.180]   Come up and see us sometime.
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:51.540]   We're just up the road apiece.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.940]   I definitely will.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:53.940]   Y'all come back now.
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:54.940]   You hear?
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:55.940]   Or something like that.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.940]   Thank you, Mark.

[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.540]   I did something we could bleep.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.300]   Just one thing and I hope you will.
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.940]   And otherwise you get to show it, twit.tv after the fact.
