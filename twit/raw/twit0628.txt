[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.840]   Is it going to lose its trademark?
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160]   It might be going to the Supreme Court over it.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.680]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.480]   Netcast you love.

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760]   The show we cover the week's Tech News in obsessive compulsive detail.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   And today you're going to be so glad you're listening because we have All In Studio, one
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.680]   of the best panels ever.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.480]   And I don't know whether I should start on the left or the right.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.720]   I'm going to start on the left because it's so rare we get Matt Cutson's studio.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.320]   Matt is the active administrator, acting administrator for the US Digital Services in
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   Washington DC.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.680]   Matt, we've had you on Twit before, back when you were a Google, one of the early Google
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   employees.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.800]   You left Google, you took a sabbatical, then went to Washington.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.960]   Mr. Cutz goes to Washington.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.280]   It'd be a great movie someday.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   And you're still there.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   Still there.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.320]   Your predecessor was a political appointee.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.080]   So when Donald Trump was inaugurated, who was your predecessor?
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   Mikey Dickerson.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Mikey Dickerson.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.920]   He had to resign.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.960]   And you were just standing there and they said, "Here, you do it."
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.760]   They asked whether I would be willing to preserve the mission of the US Digital Services.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Nice.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   What is the mission?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   Well, to make sure that federal computing services work better, you know, healthcare.gov
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.480]   is the most famous example.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.160]   So my anecdotal memory is remember when they first put healthcare.gov op-it crash because
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.280]   so many people visited it.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.560]   And Silicon Valley said, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   We could do better.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.880]   This was a government contractor and there was a lot of interconnects.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   It was a weird...
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.800]   The site was not designed to succeed."
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Right.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.280]   And Silicon Valley said, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   We can do better."
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   And a bunch of people volunteered and rewrote the code and re-did it.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.160]   And that was the birth of the USDS?
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   Absolutely.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.760]   After that, the president said, "You know, this could happen...
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.200]   If it could happen to a signature political marquee product, it could happen to anything."
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Right.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   And so, I think that's a great thing.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   I'm mad at Google because I was all set to enjoy the Eclipse.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   Google announced, oh, by the way, when the Eclipse is over, you know, it's probably smart
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   because people will be watching live streams.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   They're going to announce Android O at 11.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   What is it?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   11.24 tomorrow afternoon, 20 hours from now, right after the end of the Eclipse.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   You can just go from one straight on to the other.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   I guess that was the plan, probably.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Now, what's your best guess?
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Android O.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   Oreo?
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   I will just note that the Eclipse with a dark disk coming across it would really work well
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   with Oreo.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   Looks like a cookie.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   Right?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   Somebody said triple stuff.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Even the countdown is that sort of white disk.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   It's going to be Oreo.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   It's going to be Oreo.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Some people say it's definitely Oreo because Google, quote, accidentally released a video
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   that if you looked at the name of the file had Oreo in it, but I want to point out,
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Google is known, Hiroshi Lockheimer.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   Remember when he wrote his blog post about Android N, said, "What's N stand for?
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   I'm not going to tell you."
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   Which was complete disinformation, right?
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   Because it ended up being nougat.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Right?
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   You're right.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   I'm not wrong.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   Google is completely capable of putting...
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   They know.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   They are capable, but they often leak by mistake.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   They could have been an accident.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   And the other problem is there aren't a lot of desserts with O.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   Orange stuff.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   Orange sherbet?
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   But Oreo cookie is so iconic and it's going to make such a great statue.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   I think it's got to be...
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Here's why I don't like it.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   It is iconic, but it's a brand name.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   And remember when KitKat, which is the other brand name they use, I think a lot of people,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   I resented...
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   I think we talked about this.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Because I was like an ad every time I mentioned Android KitKat.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   It's like an ad for Android KitKat for a candy bar.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   I think in the world of candy bars, there's such old brands.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   It's like the Oreo.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   It's not that competitive.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   People like what they like, they eat what they eat.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   Is Oreo Nabisco?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   Is that who that is?
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   It's got to be.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   Something like that.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Wouldn't it be funny if we're Android Hydrox?
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   The fake Oreo?
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   Hydrox was first?
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   Carsten.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   The harvest apparently has a little skin in the game on this one.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Because he seems quite an ad.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   A little passionate there is a clips by Oreo.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   It makes sense because no one would name a cookie Hydrox.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   That's obviously from another century.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   Come on.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   That's like Moxie Cola.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   You used to Hydrox.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   What a terrible name.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   These cookies started out as medicinals.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   Don't listen to me.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Would they have to pay Oreo to use their name?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   That's the question.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   Or Oreo would pay them.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   Now, synergy.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   I think we're just now energy.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   Even though Matt was employee number 11 or something.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   In the first hundred, first hundred at Google and probably knows a lot more than he's telling.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   I'm certainly going to let you off the hook if you don't want to talk about it.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   I'm sure there's a meeting where people get together and discuss the name.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Or no.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   Or does Hiroshi just decide to type the Hiroshi that decides to...
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   I'm sure there's a team though.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   Especially when it's something like KitKat.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   You have to do coordination strategy.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   You can't just call it Oreo without talking to...
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   No.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   ...mondalei.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   That makes it.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   You're kidding.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   You're kidding.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   You're kidding.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   You're kidding.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   You're kidding.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   It doesn't cram around that.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   It's because it's division here.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   You know, the food is just so weird.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Probably, Nabisco's owned by Marla.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   Right.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   It is.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   Katie would know.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   She knows all of this stuff.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   She's a finance expert here.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   Oh, there was a site that we could go to.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   Am I saying it right?
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   Mon de laire or Mondaleis?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   I think it's Mondaleis, but actually it's not.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   Mondaleis has got a little line.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   I'm not really a food conglomerate expert, but...
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   It's one of the world's largest snack companies.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   I know that.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   It's got a little bar over the E, which would indicate Mondaleis.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   God, you've got to go to this website.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   Innovating our cracker portfolio.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   [laughter]
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Dirk Venda put to become CEO of Mondaleis International.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   Apparently they own Chipsahoy, Trident, Toblerone, Alpengold, Tang, and Oreo.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   Yeah, they don't know a lot of stuff.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   So, what do you do?
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   You go to Mona Les and say, "Would you mind?"
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   And what are they going to say, of course.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   I remember that KitKat, which is owned by two different companies, is called the C.E.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   Two different companies, is Cadbury in Europe and it's Hershey in the US or something like that.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   But I remember them, whoever it was, saying...
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Or maybe it was Google, said, "No money exchange hands."
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   Which is kind of...
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   We gave them a Ferrari, but no money exchange...
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   I mean, what?
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   It could be just a win-win kind.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   Yeah, or...
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   They helped us.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   The cafeteria got an unlimited supply of cats.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   There were some KitKat's.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   I bet there were.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   There were KitKat's here.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   So, my favorite Google I/O was the one with the head ice cream sandwich.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   They had big freezers full of ice cream sandwiches at multiple times.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   That was a great...
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   I'm much of the conference.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Yeah, let's go back to ice cream sandwiches.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   Mona Les in June did have some issues, I think probably ransomware issues, cyber attack.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   It has tech problems, unclear.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   There's the deal.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   Google said, "We'll help you with those tech problems."
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   Yeah, they need some cyber.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   That's right.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   And you supply us with a lifetime supply of...
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Yeah, for you.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Maris this week announced that the...
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   I think they got Petcha, which was a monocribe variant, cost them $300 million in lost productivity.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   $300 million because they didn't have a good backup.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   And of course Merck, the pharmaceutical company in New York City, was shut down for some time
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   due to ransomware.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   So anyway, Oreo, we'll find out probably tomorrow right after the eclipse.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   But we will actually stream that live.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   I haven't gotten my eclipse glasses yet, so I guess I'll have something to do tomorrow.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   Oh, oh, oh, we gotta give Katie a...
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   In fact, all of you, I'll be generous, can you have a premium for visiting us?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Nice.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   We have eclipse glasses.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   They are the ones that Amazon sent refunds for, but that...
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   I don't think...
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   They're the real deal.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   They're tested.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Safety tested.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   We'll get you some eclipse glasses, because I don't think you can go buy eclipse glasses at this point.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   I think you're out a lot.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   I think they were on sale for $250 on eBay.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   What?
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   Yeah, because someone will...
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   I'm not gonna miss out.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   They're just... they're 20 cent cardboard.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   I'll just go blind.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   It's cheaper.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   No big deal.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   I was reading the story of this guy that went...
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   that actually lost a lot of his vision from the last eclipse, so he felt compelled to warn everybody.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   That's right.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   It's 62.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   It's 62.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   This guy's been...
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   his vision has been damaged since '90s.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   So Katie, here you are.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   Take your pick.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   We have some official Google.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   These are Google eclipse glasses.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   Oh my goodness.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   Learn more.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   This is the eclipse mega movie.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Do you know about this?
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   I did not.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   Google and the UC Berkeley are doing something together.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Oh yes.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   Mega.movie if you want to find out about it.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   What they're doing is asking anybody who's gonna be in the totality region.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   That 70 mile wide band swath.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   It's like the Miss America Sash across the United States going from Oregon.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   You look good Mike.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   Thanks.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   Oregon to Georgia.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   If you're in the totality, you can contribute.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   Go ahead.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   Well, no, the great thing is you can't see anything through this.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   That's how you test.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   Mike and I are looking at each other.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   These are not...
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   these don't protect you.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   These show you what it's like if you look at the sun.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   This is what your eyesight will do.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   This is the virtual reality experience of an eclipse.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   So this is important.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   If you can't...
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   if you do have eclipse glasses and you can see something through them, don't wear them.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   They will not protect you.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   You should not be able to see a thing unless you look at a really...
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   and I don't think even our studio lights are bright enough.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   You have to look at really bright lights or go out and check it with the sun.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   And the sun should not be a bright disc but a little dim disc in the view.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   Don't look directly at it with these fake glasses.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   The new screensavers yesterday had the best tip ever for doing the eclipse.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   Don't take pictures of the sun.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   Take pictures of everything around you.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   Because the light will never be like that again until...
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   7 years.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Here's the Google Mega Movie promo video.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   See, the problem is there's going to be a million pictures like that.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   Unless you really know what you're doing, that's technically difficult.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   You're going to have a tripod of very long lens.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   You know, Scott, yesterday on the new screensaver said 600 millimeter lens.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   Really big expensive lens.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   10,000 people will take better pictures of it than you will.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   So don't bother.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   Plus you need to download one.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   You need a very expensive $150 filter or you will damage your DSLR and maybe your eyes if you're looking through a DSLR.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Even if you look at the pictures of those.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   Those could hurt.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   No, that's not...
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   No, no, sorry, no, I'm confused.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   That's not...
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Special fake news edition.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   What?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Don't look at the pictures of the eclipse.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   They're damaging you.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   It's like the ring.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   I mean, look at it.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   That's right.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   You'll be the next to die if you look at the eclipse pictures.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   This is kind of neat.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   So we'll watch for that.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   If you want to sign up, if you're going to be going somewhere.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   By the way, if you're not there now, don't go.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   If you go to NASA's website, eclipse2017.nasa.gov, they have a traffic map.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   And all of the places that you would go, don't go.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   It's jammed.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   We had somebody in the studio a couple of days ago saying we're going to go to the painted hills in Oregon.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   And already it was too late.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   You couldn't because so many people are trying to go there to see this.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   So read, go to the website for a NASA.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   They will point you to the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration where you will get tips.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   So do not take photographs while driving is one of the tips.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   This is my favorite one.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Do not try to wear your opaque eclipse glasses while operating a vehicle.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   Oh, no.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   But I want to see it.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   It says, "Turn your headlights on.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   Do not rely on automatic headlights."
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   They may not come on.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   Watch for pedestrians on smaller roads.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   People may be randomly parking and walking alongside the road in the hours around the eclipse to get the best view.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   That's right after the thing that says, "Don't stop and walk around to see the eclipse on the road."
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   And avoid travel during the eclipse.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   Actually, I'm going to be on, I have to drive to San Francisco during the eclipse.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   I'm kind of bummed.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   I have a radio appearance I agree to do.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   Back when we didn't know there would be a eclipse.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   So won't we see a partial eclipse pretty much everywhere in the US?
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   In fact, NASA's map shows you you can click on the map and see what you'll see.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   Like here in Northern California, it'll be a 77% Southern California, about 71%.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   So almost all of the US will get.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   That means a little sliver of sun.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   You're not going to see a whole lot of sun.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   That's where it's dangerous.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   That's where you could actually blind yourself by looking too close because it feels like it's dimmer.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   But it's apparently just as dangerous.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   You know, when I was a kid, I'm pretty sure I looked at the sun.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   You're not blind.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   I'm not blind.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   You're fine.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   The last one was in 1979, I think I read.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Yeah, you weren't even born there.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   I wasn't born yet.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Is that true?
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   I was joking.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   I'm so sorry.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   But actually I saw a funny clip earlier from ABC News where they talked about the eclipse
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   in 1979.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   They're like, the next one is happening in August 27.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   Frank Reynolds, it's a great, you know what?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   I'm going to play that clip.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   It's a great clip because it actually it's kind of touching clip because of what he says.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   Yeah, at the end.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   Something about peace happening in the world.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   That's it.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   Oh, bummer.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   Let me show you a little bit of Frank Reynolds.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   It would be kind of fun if he came back, wouldn't it?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Where was I wrong?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   To life.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   Here's the...
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   A totally eclipse of the sun, visible today over North America for the last time in this
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   century.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   [Singing]
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   And at the very end...
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   Bring you a complete report on that next eclipse.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   Thirty-eight years from now.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   Oh, wait a minute, sir.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   Thank you, YouTube, for stepping on the...
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   Thirty-eight years from now.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   May the shadow of the moon fall on a world at peace.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   And ABC News, of course, will bring you a complete report on that next eclipse.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   It's a sentence.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Thirty-eight years from now.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   I want to thank everyone in 1979.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   Frank Reynolds on ABC and the last eclipse.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Next one's not that far off seven years from now in the North America.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   Got my glasses by then.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   You got some.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Do you want the Google ones or do you want the ones from Lunt Solar Systems?
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   Who do you trust?
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   I'd go with the Google.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   I'm just saying.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   These are also wrinkly and I had read somewhere that if your glasses are wrinkly or have any
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.200]   pinpricks in them, you shouldn't use them.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   I don't know why wrinkly would be a big deal.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   But those are not wrinkly.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   So we don't want to lose you.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   So please.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   No, I like having my vision.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   Yeah, vision is good.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   Google Pixel 2, should we talk about that?
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   I wish.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   You're a Pixel user.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   I'm a Pixel user.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Mike, you're a Pixel or you're an iPhone guy.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   I'm an iPhone guy and I'd also like to talk about the Essential phone after that.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   My Essential phone's on its way.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   Yeah, this is going to be a crazy week.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Essential phone, anybody who pre-ordered it got an email last week.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   This is Andy Rubin's new company.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Already a billion dollar unicorn, right?
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   Andy, even though they've shipped nothing.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   Yeah, that's pretty impressive.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Well, they've shipped nothing late.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   That's true.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   They've never been late on a product.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   Actually, they are late because Andy Rubin was on the stage at the Recode Conference in
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   June, and he said it'll be by the end of next month.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   I actually got the fondle one on Friday.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Did you touch it?
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   I did.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   I touched it.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   Leo.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   And when you touched it, did you like it?
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   I did.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   I did your bone in the version.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   I touched it on review unit.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   He said it's the best feeling.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   It's quite amazing.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   The lack of bezel is pretty stunning.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   The little notch is not a big deal.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   All phones will be be bezel-free.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   That's true.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Going forward.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   I'm sure the Pixel will be as small a bezel as they can make it.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   I'm pretty sure the iPhone will have...
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Not only have no bezel, it will have no frame.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   It'll just be a floating piece of glass.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:11.800]   Comparing it to the iPhone 7 Plus, I would say that the fit and finish is not quite as good
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   as apples.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   It's very close.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.400]   The design is better than apples.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.200]   It's more like the iPhone 4 because it's flat on the front, flat on the back, and then
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   there's a real edge.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   I love that kind of design.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   If you absent the screen in the bezels, the big thumb at the top and bottom of the iPhone
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   7 Plus, this is a pretty gorgeous.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   This is a pretty gorgeous phone.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   It's all metal.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   I got the Jet Black one.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   It's shiny.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   I never put it in a case, which probably was a mistake.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   The roundiness of it is a very Johnny Ives thing.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   He's very much into that sort of '70s-fucur distinct.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   Soft.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   I like the round edges.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   I like the harsh industrial design.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   This is more square, the essential.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   The edge is an edge.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's a flat and there's a slight roundiness.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.600]   Then the edge is a...you can set it up on its edge or on any edge.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   It would stand up.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   It would stand up.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   Like the iPhone 4.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   If you remember that, you had the metal.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   But the coolest thing, by far, is the modularity.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.400]   It has a little magnetic thing.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.200]   They had a bunch of cameras there.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.640]   Here's the funniest thing that is not getting enough reporting.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.920]   The little camera that goes on the top has a fan in it, a tiny fan.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.360]   It's like a mosquito.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   Crazy.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.960]   It's crazy why they have that or why they need that.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.360]   It was 4K cameras, 360 camera.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   I ordered the phone and I didn't realize for 50 bucks more I could have gotten the 360s.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   Normally it would be 300 bucks.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   Should I have?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   Yes, you should have that.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.760]   You blew it.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:45.120]   The other thing that was fun is I actually went to Playground Global, which is the incubator
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.880]   that essential lives in.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   And Playground Global has a Playground.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   Well, it should.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   It's not global.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   It's local.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   Is it in South Park?
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   It's in Palo Alto.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.360]   You can just go out in the South Park.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   There's a playground in South Park.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360]   There is.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   Oh, I hadn't heard about that.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.840]   That's the famous swings where Ev and Jack were sitting on the swings and Jack said we
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.840]   should call it Twitter.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.920]   They've since remodeled South Park and they have a brand new Playground there, which I
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.520]   think is funny because it's all venture firms there now.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.760]   It's the only venture firm.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.240]   There's no kids using the Playground.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   Right.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   But I've seen some on the weekends.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Jack Dorsey goes out, everyone, so well.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.120]   He says, "I'll have a little swing."
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.200]   So they said this would come out next week, the essential phone.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   We've ordered one.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.680]   We'll have it as soon as it comes.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.840]   I made a deal with Jason Half.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.120]   It comes before all about Android.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   He gets it.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.600]   If it comes after I get it.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.400]   So that will be all watching the American FedEx truck with great interest.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.560]   My prediction is because I saw the next version as well.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.040]   They asked us not to take pictures of it.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Oh, you did.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   And look.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   The next version.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   That's why they don't want pictures of it.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   It hasn't even come out yet.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   There's a prototype.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.840]   But I'm predicting that this will be the iPhone.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   Like this is the iPhone for Android, essentially.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   Really?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.960]   High design, it's innovative.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.200]   They've done a really good job for a 1.0 product.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's a little clunky on the software side, but they're rapidly updating it even as they
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   get closer to it.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.600]   They said it's pretty pure Android.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.680]   And it will be Android O or no?
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.280]   That don't know.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   That's interesting.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.480]   I would assume it's going to come after O as an entrepreneur.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   He has to be the winner.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   But he has to adapt just like every other manufacturer.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.840]   As you know, before he left, he founded both a sidekick and Android.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   But before he left, he ran their Google's robotics division, which is most famous for
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.000]   the big dog like that dog-like robot.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And he had one.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And there was one there.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   There was one there.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He walked out of Google with it.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Did they know that he did this?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   He took one of the dogs.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Most people just take office supplies.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Those are scary.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I think you'd hear that one going.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.440]   Did you ever go to Andy Rubin's house?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   I have not been to his house.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.640]   Apparently, it was heavily automated.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   There were robots everywhere and the doors.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.600]   Have you been to his wife's restaurant?
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.360]   Well, who is his wife's restaurant?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.000]   His wife has a restaurant in Los Altos called Voyageur Dutton.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Time traveler.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Time traveler.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Exactly.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.960]   And it's a exquisite bakery.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.880]   Absolutely brilliant place.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.200]   And Andy Rubin supposedly designed a lot of the security systems and all that kind of
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   stuff.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   I'm going to go there.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   As a Wizkid.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]  com.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.600]   Apparently, nobody else wanted it.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   Oh, this site.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.400]   He walked through the security system.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   Cisco doesn't want me going to Andy Rubin's site apparently.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   Okay.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   Well, tell us.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   That's weird.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   That is weird.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.880]   Google even said that must be the wrong site.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   That's the wrong site.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880]   Okay.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   It only has three stars on Yelp if we're looking at the right one here.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   Well, you know how yelps.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   Yelp is ours.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.960]   There's a lot of angry people on Yelp.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.960]   It's expensive.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.560]   I have a friend from Google who really likes that restaurant for what it's worth.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   I want to tell them all those.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.480]   It's a very good restaurant.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.720]   And how interesting.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.960]   So, so that's phone number one this week, but it's not the last phone that will come
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.520]   out this week.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.800]   On Wednesday, the Galaxy Note 8 from Samsung will be announced.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   They'll have an event.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.240]   We're going to cover that and the O stream.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.600]   So we'll be doing a lot of live coverage on Twitter.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.760]   You can always tune in to it.tv/live to watch our coverage live.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.160]   I think that's going to be a great one.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.880]   I think it's hard to say that this will be the phone, the Android phone again.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.760]   The difference is I think that the Samsung will probably carve out the niches as the most
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.440]   powerful high-end phone.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.600]   Plus the stylus.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   Exactly.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.880]   But I do think that the essential phone will be considered more elegant.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.680]   The design is just beautiful and it feels minimalist and all this stuff.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   And then the modularity.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.000]   So, I think it's going to be the Android phone that most directly competes with the
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   iPhone.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   That's my...
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I wonder if I can retroactively go back.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I'm not switching from my iPhone though.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.520]   There's like no chance of that.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.160]   I've been using the iPhone since it first came out 2007.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.880]   You were 12 at the time.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   No, I...
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.720]   All right, I'm just teasing you now.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   I'll get it somewhere.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   I'm triangulating.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   I'm moving in.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   Okay.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.320]   Yeah, no, I've been a loyal iPhone user.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.480]   I have hundreds of apps.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.720]   I just don't want to deal with switching operating systems or anything.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.320]   Well, you're sitting at a table with three Android users.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.160]   I also have my iPhone too.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   I'm not an iPhone.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   It's an even split.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.000]   You're sitting at a table with three iPhones users.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.840]   It's because I go both ways.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.600]   I count on both teams.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   I do have a government iPhone.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   Really?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Yes.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.080]   The government gave you an iPhone?
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   Wow.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   But I'm still here with my Pixel.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   I love the Pixel.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   I just squeeze it.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   I wonder our textures are so high.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.200]   In the same way that the essential is design...
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.160]   You know, is the elegant phone.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:46.640]   The Pixel in even, I'm sure the Pixel 2 will be the undesired phone, right?
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.160]   It's not attractive.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   It's functional.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   It's super functional.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   Great camera.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.400]   All the software works great.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.000]   Pure Android, which is to me...
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   All the security matches.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   ...the number one.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.480]   So the FCC filings for at least one of the new pixels is in that one.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.000]   We've talked about this on Twig was from the little one, the HTC one.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.400]   They're going to do that squeeze thing.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.080]   They've got HTC to do with their U11.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.320]   That presumably when you squeeze the phone will activate the Google Assistant, which
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   I don't know.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   How do you feel?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   You like it?
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Don't like it.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.440]   I think it's discriminatory against people without thumbs.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   Because if you don't have...
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   If you can't do this, then...
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   You don't have opposable thumbs.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.960]   How are you holding your phone?
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   Well, that's really interesting.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.480]   What would we have done without opposable thumbs?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.720]   It feels like a cheesy kind of a feature to me.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   It seems like it's getting...
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   Squeeze your phone.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   I'll take the opposite view.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   I can't wait to squeeze my phone.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.640]   That's going to be great.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.760]   You're probably squeezing your phone already and nothing's happening.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   I am.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   That's so good.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   That's a waste right there.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.320]   I could have had my little rubber eyeballs poked out when you squeezed it.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   We were talking on Twig about this, about gestures.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.800]   Of course, one of the things about gestures that's cool is it can extend the vocabulary
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.600]   that you interact with your device.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.760]   It's a tricky balance because you want the gesture to be somewhat intuitive.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.960]   For instance, the pinch gesture, which Apple introduced, but the Carnegie Mellon created
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.120]   it first and I'm using my surface.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.200]   That seems pretty intuitive.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   You pinch it and it zooms in.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.120]   Then Google's phones have a shake gesture, which is completely intuitive.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.760]   If something crashes or you're just not happy with it, you go, "Oh, go, go, go!"
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.280]   Then it immediately pops up a little, "Would you like to send a bug report?"
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.920]   Which I love.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   That's intuitive.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.040]   Yet there are a lot of non-intuitive...
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   Motorola...
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   Moto X.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   This to activate the camera.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.560]   But we came to like it, right?
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.200]   So the squeeze, I don't know.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.840]   I think the problem with it is that very often times we don't have our phone in our
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   hand.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.920]   It's in our pocket or it's on the table or whatever.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:55.360]   I think that the superior method is the AirPod thing where you just double tap on your
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.920]   AirPods and Siri pops up and then unfortunately Siri pops up and that's a problem.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.000]   I wish the Google Assistant would pop up.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.240]   I think you say you like the iPhone but you like Siri.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.800]   No, I just don't like voice assistants in general.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.560]   Because you are stuck with Siri.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.400]   I don't know, I just don't like them.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.240]   I don't want to have to talk to a machine.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   I love it.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   I can Google stuff.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   I love talking to a live echo.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.720]   Do you have an echo?
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720]   No.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   No, my parents love theirs though.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   But I know into that.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   Yeah, all people like echoes.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.800]   Yeah, I think that might be true.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.960]   So I have a theory in this world of appliances.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   So the rumor is that Facebook is working on an appliance like the Echo.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.360]   They have at least two.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   And with the screen it's going to be a rip off of the Amazon lineup to a certain extent.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   Yes, but my prediction is that it will have what I call suggestions.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.720]   So if you use Facebook Messenger right now, there's something called M suggestions.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.840]   So you're sitting there having a conversation and we'll chime in and say, "Hey, why don't
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   you go to this restaurant?
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.040]   Why don't you listen to this song?"
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.600]   Or would you tap here to listen to this music on Spotify?
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.720]   Imagine that with a voice assistant.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.520]   That means it'd be listening to you all the time.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.520]   It has to be.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   It'll be super com.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   Exactly.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.400]   It'll be super controversial, but I think that's where we're headed inevitably anyway.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.440]   And so there are only two products to do that right now.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:18.640]   One is Google Assistant on Aloe or as we refer to it on Twig, Google, Silo.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.120]   I love that.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.640]   And Facebook M suggestions.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.000]   Those are the only two places where listening to conversations, watching text, which makes
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.200]   it a little better.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.000]   And then it chimes in and say, "Hey, what about this?"
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.760]   But I think that's where we're going with all these assistants.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.600]   It's an interesting thing, of course, because it's also a great way to gather data, right?
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.240]   I mean, Gmail was brilliant because you get this great free mail client and it can, in
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.120]   the process of just being Gmail, read all your mail.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.800]   So wouldn't it be smart for Facebook to say, "Hey, sorry, but we have to listen all the
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   time?"
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.360]   The question is whether consumers are going to accept that, right?
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   You don't want something to...
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   I think there would be a backlash.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.480]   The larger perspective is that this will happen.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.200]   Absolutely will happen where consumers will happily accept having our assistants listening
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.600]   to us all the time because the benefits will be enormous.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.840]   It'll happen in two years or it'll happen in five years or it'll happen in 10 years,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   but it will happen.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.280]   It's just how fast can we get there?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.240]   And it's also, there's also a philosophical question about whether something's listening.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.280]   If somebody isn't listening, is anybody listening?
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   No, not really.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.560]   There's a lot of data that is being referred to and as long as it can't be hacked and
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.440]   whatever, people are going to accept this.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.680]   Even you will accept this.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   Maybe.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   We'll see.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.120]   You've got a long life ahead of you, born after 1979.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   So you've got decades...
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   Too much discussion about my age.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.600]   I know, no, I'm sorry.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   It's my fault.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   We're just a bunch of old men's.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   Yes.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.080]   I've got a startup idea for you if you want, which is not just listening, but Amazon recently
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:56.280]   got a patent to scan the outside of your house with a drone so that it can target relevant
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.720]   advertising towards you.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.560]   You can go and look this up.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   But then...
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   Wait, I was talking about...
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   Wait, I was trying to tell you aluminum siding?
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   Oh, I see you have a drone.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560]   You shoot down the drone.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.600]   You have some petunias doing your trowel, right?
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.800]   It's public information.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   And although Google got a little...
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   Sure.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.640]   Trouble, because in fact, in Germany, they have to blur out.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   Right.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   Harmony, yes.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   Blurminy.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.400]   But we haven't gotten to the startup idea yet, which is...
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.320]   Well, it's trash in theory is public.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.880]   So if you really want to understand someone, you go...
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.040]   A robot that goes through the trash.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.400]   Well, you know who's missing the boat?
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   And it's missing the boat.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   Take out their trash for them.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   Waste management.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   The company...
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   And by the way, trash analytics.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.640]   There are only a handful of big companies that do most of the garbage collection in this
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.680]   country, right?
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.880]   Waste management is huge.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   Right.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.120]   So they could tell you, you threw out your cat food every two months.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   They...
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.400]   All they need to do is put some cameras in the conveyor belt.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.160]   They can say, "Well, we're sorting for recycling."
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   There you go.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.000]   And in the process...
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Wow.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   I know what that is.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   More than that.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   That is brilliant.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Time to order milk.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.400]   Is your garbage public domain?
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.200]   Well, the legal ruling has been, once you put it out on the curb, people are allowed
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   to look through it.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.440]   So that's why you have to have shredders and all this sort of stuff.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.320]   And so you could have a deal with one company that's like, "We will scan your trash for
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.080]   trash analytics, but then we'll shred it so no one else is able to look through it."
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   Right.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.120]   I think private investigators dig through trash and all sorts of scary stuff.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.480]   I mean, these days I don't even print anything else.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.680]   There's no documents for me to buy.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.640]   In fact, wasn't Silicon Valley built on dumpster diving?
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.160]   Isn't that the process that led...
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   Sure.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.880]   I've talked to many hackers who in the early days, what they did was they were looking
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.800]   for telephone company manuals when they were originally doing the phone hacking, blue boxes
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.000]   and the like.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.760]   And that's how they figured out how to interact with the network.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   They would get old manuals in dumpster dive.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   Wow.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.480]   Well, it's funny because I search for trash analytics.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.120]   And I found the Google has a lot, but it's a different...
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   It's in Google Analytics.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.560]   It's a trash can in Google Analytics.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.120]   It's a different kind.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.160]   So does somebody have a patent you said?
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.200]   So Amazon got a patent for drones to scan customer's homes and the trash advertising.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   So public domain.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.400]   Now you can't patent that, but who will be first in trash analytics?
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   Wow.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   I get a call Jason Kelle canis.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.160]   We got to get to work on this.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.160]   That's brilliant.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.560]   I'm not kidding.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.880]   Well, you see exactly all the packaging.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.800]   You see exactly what people buy, which is the highest segment value of what people are
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   doing.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.200]   Jason should launch a newsletter immediately called Inside Trash.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:35.160]   So I'm curious how people, normal people, I already gave up all sense of privacy.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   And I don't mind.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.320]   And you know, I'm kind of wallow in it.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   It's like fine.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   I don't care.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.920]   I get better ads.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   It's not really an invasion of privacy.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.720]   I mean, there's a lot of people think of the moral hazard of maybe an insurance company
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.560]   will decide not that will count the number of liquor bottles.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.560]   Too many Oreos.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.160]   Or Oreo packages in your trash and not or up.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.600]   But that's not happened.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.280]   And I don't think it will happen because I think insurance companies don't really care
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.360]   because they expect you to be honest on that questionnaire and they'll ask you, do you
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   smoke?
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   Do you drink?
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   Do you eat Oreos?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.880]   And they actually hope you lie because if you just deny you would, they can deny you
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   payment because we know you smoked.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.720]   And you need another startup for people to come and swap your trash with trash that
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   looks healthy.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   Oh, be the same.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.960]   You know, the same people sell pee for for for dope drug tests.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   Exactly.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   That'd be a new sideline.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   Oh, man.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   I shall be in trash.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   What do you want?
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   You can have either one.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.920]   Maybe that's the guy in the Capitol music for free.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   We shall pee.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.080]   We shall trash whatever you want to protect your privacy.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.520]   American waste management Houston, Texas.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.160]   I think they're publicly held in the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.920]   I think, I think Katie, I want you to get right on this for your equity podcast.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   This is the-
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   We don't talk about trash.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.920]   But you should-
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   If you're talking about the tech business-
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   That's not tech.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   This is brilliant.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   It's data.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   It's just data.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.400]   They're already doing this in recycling centers.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.760]   They have, I know they have cameras over the streams.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.840]   And they would just be a little bit more analytics and they could, they would know.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.960]   You would even do it.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.800]   You could even say just from this street.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.040]   You wouldn't have to say, and we'll send a blimp over that street.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   Right.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   We'll collect your trash for free.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.560]   All we ask is the data we get from it.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.600]   You get to have a fixture for the toilet.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   Yes.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.600]   Oreos again.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.920]   This is really bad.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   If waste management doesn't do this, I'm starting.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.480]   Actually, I don't want to get in that business.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   There's stocks up 16%.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Just from this conversation.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   Just from this conversation.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   So through the last world.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   The big business.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   All right.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]   Essential phone.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   Pixel, I'm excited.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   I'm going to hold out.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.160]   LG is making the big one.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   HD, supposedly.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.000]   HTC is making the little one.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.800]   Your nodding does not in any way.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   A legend.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   You know anything.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.360]   You just read the same stories I have.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:56.080]   I think LG just, this was an interesting kind of sort of thing.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.920]   The LG has announced a new V30 phone.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.720]   And a number of people have played with it said if this is what the next pixel is like,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.200]   this is going to be awesome.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.160]   As a list design.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.080]   A very interesting camera, multiple camera modules.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.360]   The V30 is imminent.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   It is kind of how it works, right?
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:25.920]   Is the company that, like the HTC is basing its version of the Pixel kind of on the U11?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.520]   I think it kind of depends a little bit.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.000]   Is Google maybe telling them more what they want and they're just going to manufacture?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Recently, yeah.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   That's right.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.720]   Well, anyway, this is, so this would be a bad day to buy a smartphone.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   Yes.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:45.320]   Wait just a little bit because Apple's got a three weeks or less before Apple's big announcement.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.520]   And I'm very interested what Apple's going to do.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.960]   All right, we'll watch with interest as all of this happens.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   Let's take a little break.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.160]   Got a great in-studio team.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.000]   It's really fun to have all three of you.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.400]   Katie Ruf is here from TechCrunch.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.280]   She's a senior writer there.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:05.040]   And hosts the equity podcast, Katie Underscore Ruf.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.320]   There's another Katie Ruf.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   How dare she?
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.160]   Well, actually, I originally had the raise the roof handle.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   That's even better.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   Nice.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.320]   But I deleted Twitter and then I had to join it when I became a reporter.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Me too.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Me too.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   I've deleted Twitter.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   How many of you here show of hands have deleted and then rejoined?
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Many.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   Yeah, I think it's the beginning.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Have you two?
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   Long ago, yeah.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.820]   I deleted it because I thought, oh, there's going to be a copyright trademark confusion.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.060]   I was kind of mad at him that he named it Twitter because we've pre-speceded them.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.500]   You guys beat them to it.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   Anyway, that's all.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.780]   Leo was once the number one user on Twitter.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   I was.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.540]   You want to know when I was number one on Twitter, how many followers I had?
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.540]   5,000.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.780]   That's all it took.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.700]   That's all it took.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.380]   And then Kevin Rose and I were in a battle and he finally beat me with 5,001.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.340]   I was so...
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.180]   Now I think there are other people with more.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   I've heard.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   I may be wrong.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   They're all bots.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.500]   Nobody has more than 5,000, really.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.700]   Mike Elgin is also here.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700]   Got it.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.340]   I'm so excited about your Gastronomad.net.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.500]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.780]   Thank you for being here.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.780]   And we will miss you.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.980]   So how long are you going to go?
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   Until November.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   Oh, that's not long.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.980]   Yeah, it's not too long.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.980]   You got a grand kid here.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   You got to come back a lot.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   That's right.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.980]   Well, she's actually going to be with us.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.980]   She's going to be a boss.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.980]   Yeah, she's going to be a boss.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.980]   Where's the squishy face?
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   All right.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.980]   And also, Provence, we're going to...
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   She's going to be with us the whole time.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.180]   She's not even a year old yet, and already has better trouble.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.180]   Hashtag Globe toddler.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.180]   That's what we're using.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.180]   I like it.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.180]   I like it.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.980]   And I am so honored, really, to have a member of the federal government here today, acted
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:40.180]   administrator for the United States Digital Service, really doing...
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.580]   Great to be here.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   Good work.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   Important work, Matt Cutts.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.580]   So nice to have you here.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.180]   And we welcome more people who want to join.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.780]   Yeah, and we'll use this as an opportunity to get people to go to usds.gov, right?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.780]   And I think it's like usds.gov/join.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   Join.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.780]   That's right.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   Clever.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.180]   You guys know how you know a little bit about SEO, right?
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.980]   Yeah, you've heard of these.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.380]   I think Matt, for years, did the Webmaster videos for Webmaster for Google that were so
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.380]   good.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.380]   Thank you.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.380]   You're missed there.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.380]   I loved those.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.540]   Our show today brought to you by PayPal Working Capital.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.500]   PayPal knows running a business is complicated.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   Takes a lot of your time.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.300]   There's a lot of money to start a business, doesn't it?
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.980]   PayPal Working Capital is giving you an opportunity to give your cash flow a boost with a $5,000
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.380]   business loan.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.900]   PayPal Working Capital makes your life as a business owner easier.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.780]   They don't require a credit check that saves time and applying will not affect your credit
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.500]   score.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   They can provide one affordable fixed fee versus periodic interest.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.580]   That makes it a lot easier to plan.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.140]   They offer flexible repayments that are automatically deducted as a percentage of sales.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.380]   That's kind of cool, right?
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.340]   So you don't have to pay more than you can afford.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:57.380]   For a limited time, when you accept $50,000 in payments with PayPal, you get preselected
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.540]   automatically for a $5,000 business loan.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.900]   No credit check or personal guarantee required.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.780]   By the way, I found out we qualified.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.940]   That was awesome.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.060]   To participate, all you got to do is sign up for a PayPal business account and start accepting
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.260]   payments within 60 days.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.780]   We accept PayPal payments as a tip per our tip chart.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.860]   So podcasters, this would actually be a great tip for you.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.580]   Set it up as a tip chart.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.660]   When you process at least $50,000 in payments, which won't take that long, you can apply
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.740]   for your PayPal Working Capital within 240 days.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.020]   If you're approved, $5,000 automatically deposited into your PayPal account.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.220]   So boost your cash flow with a $5,000 business loan from PayPal Working Capital.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.420]   It's easy to do.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.300]   Set it up, a PayPal business account and start accepting payments.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:49.940]   Visit paypal.com/twit to learn more additional terms and conditions, apply to the 550 promotion.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.260]   You can find out more at paypal.com/twit.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.340]   We thank PayPal.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:59.540]   For years, PayPal made it possible for us to do what we do here and we're very grateful
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   to them.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.540]   I think it's great that they're empowering you to get a new credit.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.540]   It's very timely too, because if you're going to get the new iPhone, you're going to need
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.540]   that line.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.540]   You're going to need that $5,000.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   Holy cow.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.900]   The rumor is over a thousand.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.060]   But I don't think this market is that price sensitive at that high end.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:19.860]   They'll still offer the 7S and the 7S Plus, but I think that there are tens of millions
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.860]   of people.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.180]   It's almost sad to say who will gladly fork out.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.260]   I bet you're one of them, Keith.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.260]   I will.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.260]   I'm going to get it.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.260]   Right?
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.260]   I think.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.020]   It's a work expense.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.300]   It's just, well, first of all, it is your main computer, right?
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.940]   So paying $1,000 for a computer is not that outrageous.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.220]   It's your main computer these days, one you use far more than any other.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.340]   The register calls them your fondle slab.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.020]   Well, you know, actually, it's funny you mentioned that because I recently invested
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.340]   a great deal in an iPad.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:53.300]   This is a 10.5 inch with 512 gigs with the SIM card thing.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.780]   So this is almost a $1,200.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.380]   That's a real computer that 512 gigs is stored.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.820]   Well, with iOS 11, it is.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.820]   And I got the AirPods.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.420]   I got the keyboard, the $100.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.820]   I got everything because this is now my main computer.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.540]   That's all you use.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.660]   I use my MacBook Pro for specific things that haven't caught up to the iPad yet.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.820]   So MailChimp, a couple of other things for designing things.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.180]   But mostly I use this and I'm trying to get off the phone as well.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.660]   I'm trying to get to the point where I don't actually need a phone.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.660]   If you could use that for the phone, I guess you could with Skype or FaceTime or--
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.900]   When I'm abroad, I'm not using the phone network anyway or I'm using a local SIM card.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   What do you use?
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   Use line?
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:39.380]   So I use FaceTime audio for regular calls with my family.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.380]   For business calls.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.380]   For business calls.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.020]   And you give out a Google Voice number and that rings your iPad.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.020]   Exactly.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   Yes.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   Well, I don't want it to ring.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.020]   I don't answer my phone.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.100]   Go ahead and call me but leave a message.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:55.340]   And then if I want to make a call to somebody who doesn't have FaceTime, I just use Hangouts.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.860]   Now how does that work though if you're overseas?
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.340]   I thought Hangouts is only US and Canada.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.340]   You can do it out now.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.340]   No, it works great in international--
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.340]   Because you're a US account.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.660]   Okay, that works fine.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.660]   And it's great.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.220]   And it's free or cheap.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.260]   I actually bought a Fi SIM for my iPad.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.260]   That gives you the data.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.260]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.180]   And it's at the same price as part of your regular phone account.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   And you can pause your--
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   Right.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.180]   Stuff.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.660]   So if you're not going overseas for a while, you're like fine.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.340]   I'll just put it in the drawer for three months.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.340]   That was free.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.060]   I actually thought that was a really good travel tip.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.180]   Just order an extra SIM and put it in something.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   It's not for phone though.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   It's only for data.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.180]   Right.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.940]   But so far so good, I'm getting there.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.340]   I think within six months--
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.180]   Are you using iOS 11?
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.180]   Yes.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.660]   So you did the beta, the public beta?
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660]   I did, I did.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.940]   But I think I'll get to the point where no phone, no laptop, 100% iPad, and I think that'll
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.940]   be great.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   But wait, Mike, you might say.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   But wait.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.940]   That's ridiculous.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   That's insane.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.940]   What about checking Facebook?
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.940]   What about doing--
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:53.940]   You can do all that.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.460]   I'm trying to-- I think we've reached the point where we're too addicted, we're too
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.460]   distracted.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.860]   Our phones are actually problematic for us now.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   And using a cell phone the way we use them is like driving to the store that's one block
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   away.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   Right.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.260]   It is easier, but you really should walk.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.260]   Right.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.260]   And so--
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.260]   Actually, I don't even do that.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.380]   I mean, when I was living in New York, I would order stuff from my phone.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   Sure.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.380]   It's to cart.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.380]   And it would be like--
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.380]   It's the store.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.380]   It was the store.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.380]   It was the store.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.380]   It was the store.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   It was the store on my corner, and I still did it.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.380]   Right.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.380]   Right.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.380]   Well, living in New York is not good for you.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.380]   That's true.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.380]   I can confirm that.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.380]   You don't have to ever step out of your apartment.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:34.860]   iOS 11 is a whole new ball game for using an iPad as a real computer.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.500]   Of course, I don't really do real work on journalists.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   I would agree with you.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.500]   And I'm doing the same thing.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.220]   I have a 10/5 and put iOS 11 on it.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:46.740]   But I do think that Apple's got to really kind of kick developers into making the equivalent
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.700]   of desktop apps for iOS 11.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   Yes, they do.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Yes, they do.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.500]   But I think the first step is iOS 11.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.660]   I think iOS 11 is going to change a lot of things in the industry.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:00.380]   First of all, it's going to make augmented reality a really big part of our everyday--
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.420]   lots of apps will have augmented reality.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.460]   The second thing is iOS 11 on an iPad is really going to change how people use their
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.340]   iPads, which I think that will be the trigger for companies to produce iPad apps that are
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.340]   real apps.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.460]   And they'll be able to charge for them because people like the two of us, I mean, will pay
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.740]   anything because we're like stars in our eyes.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.540]   I mean, maybe not anything, but I don't really like.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   But you're less pre-sensitive, right?
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.540]   I mean, you--
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.540]   That is true.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.540]   It's almost an elastic demand.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.540]   It is.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   It's an economic term.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   It is.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.060]   But, yeah, I don't know.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:36.020]   I mean, I'm definitely a loyal iPhone and clearly Mac user.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.380]   You're using, I'm surprised, a MacBook Air.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.820]   Well, I like it small because I don't want to carry around a heavy laptop.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.940]   And you're mostly writing.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.100]   So the screen resolution-- it's the lowest screen resolution Apple still offers.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.100]   But it's fine for writing.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   And it's super light.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.180]   I noticed though you have a physical object blocking your camera.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.180]   You have a little--
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.140]   I'd rather just not have that there.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.460]   I mean, I can turn it on and then turn it on.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.020]   Some of the opposite, I put more cameras everywhere.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.220]   I'm never off camera anywhere.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.220]   I know why it'd be silly.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.540]   Wouldn't it be funny if I had a shutter on the camera on my laptop?
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.700]   That'd be crazy, Tom.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.660]   You know, it's really an interesting market.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.780]   I am not that sanguine about where Apple is going with its laptop strategy, particularly
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.940]   with Macintosh strategy, particularly.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.900]   It seems as if they've just kind of stopped making interesting Macintosh.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:32.900]   Yes.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.900]   Right.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.900]   And there's not much more--
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.100]   They haven't even updated your beautiful air.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.700]   It would be so nice if they put a retina screen on a MacBook Air.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.540]   But they don't even bother.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.660]   And instead, they put the stupid touch bar.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:52.460]   I feel like they've given up what they really hope is exactly your vision of the future,
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.860]   which is that everybody will stop buying those darn Macintoshs and start buying more
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.860]   iPads.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.260]   I'm sure the margin's better on those.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.460]   I think the next thing they're going to do is copy Microsoft and have a gigantic tablet
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.460]   like this one.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.460]   This is nice.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.380]   This is really-- Apple really should have something like this.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.500]   They don't want to do touch, but the problem is they won't ever do it on Mac OS, but the
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.180]   point is they want everybody to go to iOS.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.180]   That's the future.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   Yep.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.180]   That's right.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.500]   They're just too slow and gradual for my taste.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.260]   But I think this is the beginning.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.780]   And I think they'll get there.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:30.180]   But in the meantime, an iPad is a great single computer and it seems really, really expensive.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:33.860]   But if you compare that with the combined cost of MacBook Pro and an iPhone, which is
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.860]   considered normal--
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.100]   I'm struggling with this.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.660]   I do what you're doing.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.100]   Got a keyboard case.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:46.140]   And I'm trying to put Pro software on there so I can do some of the photo editing would
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.780]   be a big one for me.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:48.780]   And I think we're getting close.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   Yep.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.500]   And then the other end, I'm using Linux.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.260]   And because I don't want to use Mac OS anymore.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.140]   And I don't want to be limited to my hardware choices.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.860]   So I'm buying Windows PCs.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.940]   You're nodding as if this is something you do.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.500]   Well, Chromebook Linux--
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   The Chromebook is very similar.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.500]   That's what it's stuff.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   Chromebook is Linux.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.700]   It's just a kind of lockdown, but very secure, very robust, very reliable.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.300]   Do you use a Chrome-- but you don't-- you must use a real computer at work, right?
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.140]   We have real computers.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.780]   For web design required use.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.940]   You really wouldn't want to use a Chromebook for web design.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.580]   You wouldn't want to use-- I guess somebody called me the other day.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.060]   She said, on web designer, I love CODA 2.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.620]   Panic software is really pretty cool.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.100]   Web design software for the iPad.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.860]   She says, is there anything like that on a Mac?
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.420]   Well, we've come a long way.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.500]   Where you're looking for software in your Mac that is as good for web designing as the
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.660]   tool you're using in your iPad.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.500]   There's actually a lot of that out there.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:45.100]   The mobile version of the web is better in a lot of ways than the desktop version of
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.100]   the web.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.580]   There are a lot of apps that only work through apps.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.900]   There is no web service, right?
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.420]   There's lots of stuff like that out there.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:52:00.100]   I mean, it's things as simple as a snap seed, which is Google's best photo editing packages.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.260]   Unavailable on the desktop completely.
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.700]   I use the iPhone version on my iPad and it's still the best thing out there.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:10.180]   So there's one more event coming up soon.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.340]   Intel's going to announce its eighth generation processor.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.340]   Didn't we just get the seventh generation processor?
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.620]   Coffee Lake is about to come out.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.300]   Is it a lake of coffee?
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.940]   Isn't that sound nice?
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   Isn't that sound delicious?
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.940]   I don't know.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.940]   Tea sounds better to me.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.540]   I think Venti is probably a big enough tea lake.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.140]   Well, we're on KB Lake right now before that was Sky Lake and next is Coffee Lake.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.980]   Is there an ice lake in there somewhere?
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.980]   I can't.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.700]   You know, they actually did leak out the next one.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.500]   I think Tom's hardware are not.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.500]   I think he's an odd.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   I think it's not.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   It's supposed to be ice lake.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.500]   Ice lake.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.500]   You're right.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.980]   Do you have a Chrome extension that changes ice to coffee?
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   That's an on-tech.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.420]   Yeah, they got the...
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:53:00.420]   So the eighth generation is going to be a bigger jump than the seventh generation.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.620]   The Coffee Lake is still 14 nanometers.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.580]   They call it 14 nanometers plus, like, I don't know what that means.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.580]   It's a plus size 14.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.820]   I don't know what that means.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.220]   But the big jump is going to be the 10 nanometers.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.020]   But the reason I bring that up is Intel's not slowing down.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.940]   It's acting as if desktop computing is here to stay.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.620]   We're building $10 billion fabs.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.020]   We're creating a 10 nanometer process.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.020]   We're all in.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.380]   Are they nuts?
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.940]   Given what you just said, isn't everything going to go arm?
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.940]   Not everything.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.180]   I mean, everything is going to the cloud and the cloud is based on really powerful servers
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.180]   and things like that.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.180]   Oh, so servers we do.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.180]   And, you know, they're...
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.180]   So that's Intel's future servers.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.220]   I think that the average consumer...
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.620]   I don't think the average consumer is going to do...
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.060]   Phones are going to be with us for a long, long time.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.100]   But these phones are going to have to get super processor intensive.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.740]   And I'm not sure that what you're talking about here with Intel, that's not something
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   that's going to affect mobile.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.980]   They have never been able to do mobile successfully.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.780]   No, it feels like Intel really missed the boat because they were concentrating on AMD.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.900]   And they're like, "Aha, we're leaving you in the dust."
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:09.060]   But they completely missed all of the stuff with Qualcomm and a lot of the mobile stuff.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:14.980]   Well, my prediction is that augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, all the realities,
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.020]   which by the way, will all be mixed up together.
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.020]   It won't be separate things.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:21.780]   It'll all be kind of like individual apps will do it all.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.980]   It's going to be the biggest thing in technology since the internet itself came onto Windows
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.660]   browser in the '90s.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.260]   It's going to change absolutely everything.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.540]   It's going to change how we perceive the world.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.180]   It's going to change everything.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.460]   And these...
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.300]   And no processor is fast enough for this stuff.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:43.340]   We're going to have to be pumping so much raw graphics, compute power into all of our
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.660]   devices because we're always going to want more of this stuff.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.100]   And again, this is going to start with ARKit shortly.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.580]   I'm surprised you're so sold on AR.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.420]   What is the application you think?
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.420]   You said AR will be everywhere.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   What's the application?
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.020]   All the stuff that's so initially because of Apple.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.780]   Besides Pokemon Go.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.860]   See, that's Pokemon Go is...
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   Poor man's AR.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.860]   Exactly.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.100]   It doesn't actually place it in a specific place in space.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.180]   It's like GPS, right.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:17.380]   So the first thing to understand is that for a while it's going to be on tablets and phones.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.700]   That's where AR is going to live for a year or two.
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.060]   The iPhone, the next generation iPhone primarily.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.060]   Exactly.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.060]   But ARKit is really going to change it.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:29.900]   There's a lot of speculation that this 10.5-inch iPad Pro was designed, over-designed.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.060]   It's clearly a lot faster.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.260]   It was a big jump in speed.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.500]   They've got different kinds of cameras that it was over-designed because they see this
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   as the AR.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.140]   And that's one of the reasons to choose an iPad.
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.620]   An iPad instead of like a Chromebook or something like that.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.780]   Because we'll look back and say all those Chromebooks they can't do augmented reality.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.340]   They can't because they don't have a camera.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.580]   The Microsoft ones do, by the way.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.980]   They have a camera that points that way.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.460]   But MacBooks don't.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.300]   They only have a camera that points that way.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.460]   You can't do augmented reality with that, not even on the table.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.380]   So it's going to really be a big deal.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.580]   But all of that work that's going to be done on...
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.940]   Again, what's the application?
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.860]   The application is glasses.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.940]   Glasses are going to replace phones.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.540]   We're a long way from that.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.180]   We're five, six, seven years.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.180]   Big problems.
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.700]   You've got battery, you've got processor, iPhone itself is 10 years old, Leo.
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.020]   Five or six or seven years is not very far into the future.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.660]   It's coming up very soon.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.700]   And the content and the...
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.020]   This is the guy who used to wear Google Glass though.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.020]   Remember this.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.020]   I remember that.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.020]   Right.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.020]   I still defend Google Glass.
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.060]   I think there is a barrier, a fashion barrier.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.060]   Exactly.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   I love wearing glasses.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   Katie, you wear glasses.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.060]   And if they could do that, you would buy them.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.060]   Sure.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.420]   But we're a long way from what Mike just described looking like regular.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.780]   Ten years from now, you go to the optometrist and you get your frames.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   I mean, I'm a little smart.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.780]   You'll say smart.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.780]   And you'll say smart.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   And you'll just be a normal person.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   Smart or not smart.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.780]   I like that you are an optimist about it.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.780]   Because I didn't say about watching you.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.380]   I mean, seeing the VR cycle a couple times, I'm like, "Mm, we'll see."
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.660]   But it's good that you are thinking about, "Yes.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.900]   This will eventually happen."
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:12.220]   I wrote a column a year ago called AR in the demon-haunted world.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.220]   I love that name.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.820]   And it's a reference to Carl Sagan's book.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:20.740]   But basically, one of the things that I predict is in the future they'll have your loved ones,
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.100]   they'll create a virtual version of your loved ones to be standing either where they
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.300]   died or at their grave site or something like that.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.300]   Oh, God.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   And if you're wearing the glasses or how they are, they'll be standing away.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.900]   Pop, what are you doing there?
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:35.540]   And psychologically, this apparition will be indistinguishable from ghosts.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.540]   Right?
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:37.540]   Basically.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.540]   It is ghosts.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.700]   So now a Japanese company is doing that.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.620]   For $4.50 a month, they'll provide your loved ones standing at their grave site or some
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.620]   other place talking to you through augmented reality.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.620]   It's ghost hosting.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.700]   But think of the world of children.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.220]   Think of children.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.220]   You want an electronic babysitter.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.420]   You're going to give them the pair of glasses.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.260]   And Goofy and Mickey are going to be dancing all around them.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.260]   It's a nightmare.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.660]   You're just going to be confusing things.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.340]   You're describing Blade Runner.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.860]   This is not a good world.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.940]   Described our world to people in 1979.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.460]   They would say, oh my God, I'm going to kill myself.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:11.460]   This is horrible.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.260]   Thank God I'll be dead by then.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.260]   There's one bright silver line to hold this.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.260]   I'll be dead by then.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.260]   I will be here.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.900]   I have to say Apple is doing the right thing though because ARKit, they are getting it
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.900]   out there.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.900]   Developers are jumping on it.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.900]   It's fairly easy.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.860]   If you do Unity, it's easy enough to incorporate AR.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:33.420]   If you just look hashtag made with ARKit, here's another one.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   Get ready.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:40.540]   These line labs create a rover, the AR/VR dog game.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.540]   Do you have sound on me?
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.260]   I'm not hearing it.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.340]   Maybe there's no sound.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.180]   So this is your virtual pet.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:52.100]   Look, I'm going to throw a virtual stick.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.220]   Rover will go catch the virtual.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.100]   Oh my God, this is stupid.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.660]   You know, if you're going to make a virtual reality dog, make it run faster for crying
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.660]   out loud.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.820]   It's taken forever.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.900]   I got time for this.
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.700]   Now is that satisfying?
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.700]   No.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.700]   Remember the Tamagotchi nanopets?
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   Yes.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.540]   I mean they come a long way.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:15.660]   Well, you're right.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.100]   You probably did nanopets as a kid.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.100]   Neopets.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.100]   Neopets.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.100]   That's what my daughter did was Neopets.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.500]   It was a website you created.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.180]   And then I had a Tamagotchi and the nanopets and the little thing you put on your--
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.180]   Little keychain.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.180]   At least you don't have to clean out the litter.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.500]   But they were all the rage.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.900]   They really were all the rage.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.220]   But I think that real pet gives you a lot more than this gets you.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.220]   Don't you?
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.220]   And by the way--
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.220]   A pile of poop, for example, gives you a lot more.
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:42.220]   Look at this picture.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.380]   This is something weird is going on with this dog.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.540]   This doesn't look healthy.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   That's not good.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.900]   That's what's going to happen though.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.700]   It's going to terrify people.
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:52.740]   I'm just imagining haptic feedback for your dog where you have a little bit of fur that
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.900]   will do something while you're trying.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.060]   If you can make it purr, you might have a business.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   [snoring]
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.900]   Or you could funk it purr.
[00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:59.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.900]   Anyway.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900]   Anywho.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   You're right.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.900]   But I'm glad I'll be beded by then.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.900]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:09.740]   It's just going to-- but I-- Ghost in the Shell, where the whole city that they're in
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.660]   is like alive with things moving.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   Yes.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.660]   And it's just-- it's kind of-- I don't get right though.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   This is dopey and looking.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.980]   Imagine if you came here from a hundred years ago.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.220]   It would seem like that.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.660]   It's like another dimension that is available to you at all times.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.980]   You can just throw on the glasses and you can see the fourth dimension.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.500]   And you can populate it with all kinds of different things.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.260]   And I just think it's going to be super compelling.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.620]   And you know, we'll seamlessly move from virtual to augmented reality.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.620]   I'm back.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.180]   We've already seen apps in ARKit that do that.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.420]   We're going to enter a long period of uncanny valley.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.420]   Yes.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.260]   Where this stuff will seem creepier than it seems appealing.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.140]   I think it could be decades.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.940]   It could be a hundred years before what the real promise of this is, which is that that
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.860]   dog would be indistinguishable from a real dog.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.300]   Your parents at the grave would be indistinguishable from your parents.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.980]   There would be, it would be almost reality.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.340]   But before that happens, you're going to have this awful uncanny valley where it's just
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.340]   creepy as hell.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.020]   Well, this is the challenge of the developers.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.500]   I mean, the most, the first use will be turn-by-turn directions.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.260]   You'll see the arrows in space.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.980]   I have a heads-up display.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   I wouldn't mind that.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.900]   It's going to be, that's going to be a beautiful way to walk around a city that you're unfamiliar
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.900]   with.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.820]   The second thing will be face recognition and oh, you met this person three years ago.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   That I'm looking forward to.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.180]   That'll be cool too.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.540]   But the most interesting thing is we don't know.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.420]   When they launched the iPhone in 2007, could we have predicted all the stuff that you can
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   do with smartphones?
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.980]   Like, nobody could have predicted that stuff.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:42.180]   So nobody can predict what we'll come about because of augmented reality.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.780]   But we can assume that it's going to be amazing, surprising, and useful.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.420]   There'll be tons of choice.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.140]   It'll be on all the platforms.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   And it's going to be pretty great.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:57.100]   I think we'll figure out the goofy glasses problem.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.620]   Once we do that, it's going to go totally mainstream.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:08.260]   I actually need this because I have a handicap that I think others have called a prosopagonosia
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.860]   face blindness.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.740]   If I'm not looking at your face, I can't remember your face.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.220]   And so I often meet people.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.860]   It just happened the other day.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.820]   I met you before the other hour, a minute ago.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.300]   But I don't remember people's faces at all.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.700]   So this kind of augmented reality.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   I have that too.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.180]   I'm sorry for anyone I've forgotten.
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.980]   But we meet a lot of people, right?
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   That's part of our job.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.020]   That's a good way to go to networking events every night.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.780]   But I can't even see the face of my kids.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   Oh.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:36.780]   I mean, I can't.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.780]   Can you see your mom's face?
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   If you close your eyes, you see it.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780]   No, I can't.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   In detail.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.780]   You don't have what I would like to explain.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   I literally...
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780]   Yeah, it's a good excuse.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.780]   Just say.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:46.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.780]   I have prosopagonosia.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.780]   I can't.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.780]   I can't.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.780]   I can't remember you.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.780]   I never will see you again.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   So goodbye.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.780]   Augmentary reality could say this guy has a problem.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   I know.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   That's kidding.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780]   Whatever roof you worked with or on Twitch.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.780]   What are you?
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   Crazy?
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.780]   It would be nice.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.780]   Tap here to talk to your psychologist.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780]   That would be nice.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   This is your mother.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.460]   This is your daughter.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.460]   She gave you life.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.940]   No, I didn't realize I had this.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.340]   I just thought this was normal.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   And then...
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.140]   But I don't recognize people all the time.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.540]   And now I realize I actually have a clinical thing.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.860]   I think I'm more auditory.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.580]   I can hear people's voices and I can recognize audio like that.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.580]   I know it's you immediately.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.060]   But if your face, I can't...
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.660]   I don't even know what you look like now, Matt.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.020]   I'm not looking at you.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.580]   I have no idea what you look like.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.820]   He has that Matt cuts look.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.100]   Matt cuts acting administrator for the USDS.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   So great to have you.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.780]   US Digital Service.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.100]   Big, big group in Washington, D.C.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.780]   Working tech work better for the American people.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.020]   God bless you for the job you do.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.700]   Katie Ruf making people understand what the hell's going on in finance over there.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.100]   TechCrunch, her equity podcast.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.140]   She's also a senior writer.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.420]   Do you cover a variety of stuff or mostly just finance?
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:03.420]   Yes.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.420]   Well, no, I cover a variety of things.
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.220]   I mean, sometimes I do videos about apps.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.980]   I could really do anything.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.580]   One thing about techCrunch is we don't have narrow beats.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   Nice.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580]   We're kind of allowed to do anything.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580]   We're not really going to be able to do anything.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   We're going to do things like tech related and hopefully also news.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.700]   It has to be true as well.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.700]   No fake news.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.700]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:25.940]   But really, there's a lot of flexibility with what we report on compared to other organizations.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.580]   If I say Jeff Imelt, can you see his face?
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.060]   Yeah, but...
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.780]   He may have an important job soon.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.780]   Just a little bit.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.820]   Also, Mike Elgin is here.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.860]   He is traveling the world in search of great food.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860]   That's right.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860]   Astro Nomad.
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860]   And writing for computer work.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   The world house company.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:49.460]   And as you already can tell, if you're listening, one of the most astute and I think really
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.220]   sharp guys in this business who kind of under...
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.860]   We talk about the events.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.180]   You seem to understand kind of more what it means.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.580]   I think it's very good at doing that.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.580]   It's nice to have all of them.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   Thank you, here.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.380]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.900]   Quick and Loans, best lender in the country.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.580]   All right, I have to admit, the last home loan I got three, four, almost four years ago
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.060]   was not from Quick and Loans.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.060]   It was from that big bank.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.020]   You know, when the stagecoach bank, the one.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:16.580]   And that was a terrible experience.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.020]   So it took us almost four months to get a loan.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.020]   They kept coming back.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.020]   They wanted more paperwork.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.020]   I thought this was...
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.020]   I don't know what this was.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.020]   I thought it was because of the 2008 collapse or whatever.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.860]   But they wanted more document.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.380]   We almost lost the house because it took so long.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.380]   Fast forward.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.660]   The year is 2017.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.780]   The best lender in the country.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.780]   Quick and Loans.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.020]   And I can say that because if you go to their website, you'll see they win every year.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.660]   For the last seven years, number one in JD Power's Customer Satisfaction Survey for primary mortgage
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   origination.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.820]   I mean, they really are the best and for mortgage servicing.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.820]   So they really are the best.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   These guys have created a product for geeks that lets you apply for a loan entirely online.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.580]   You can do it on your phone.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.580]   You don't have to go through any paperwork or anything because they have trusted relationships
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.780]   at all with all the financial institutions.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.780]   So you just...
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   They say...
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.980]   Literally, it's kind of wild if you do it.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.180]   They say, "Okay, well, this is your bank account," right?
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.700]   And you say, "Yeah."
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.780]   Because they have all that information.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.380]   Once you give them the basics, they fill in all the blanks for you.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.740]   You don't have to fill in the form.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.340]   They just do it for you.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.740]   And then they say, "Okay, based on all this," and they do this in a minute, "Based on all
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.620]   your income, your assets, your credits, here are the loan options for you.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.620]   You can choose the term.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.620]   You can choose the rate.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.020]   This is what we offer you."
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.020]   It is amazing.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.060]   It is simple to use.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.060]   It is completely transparent.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.740]   So you know exactly what you're getting.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.780]   You're going to get the confidence you need when you're buying a home or refinancing.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.660]   And the thing is you can do that not months, not weeks, not days.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:49.260]   In minutes, you could do it at an open house.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:54.660]   You could do it during the commercial breaks on Game of Thrones, which there are none.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   Okay?
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.900]   So apply simply, understandably, mortgage confidently.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.300]   You could do it in between battle scenes.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.980]   Let's put it that way on Game of Thrones.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.700]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2, equal housing lender, licenses in all 50 states and MLS.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.700]   consumeraccess.org/thirty30.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.060]   That's a new URL.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060]   So make a note of it.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.180]   Bookmark it in your browser, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.140]   I know you're not buying a house right now.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:23.300]   You're listening to Twit, but the next time you are, if you have a bookmark, you'll go
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.180]   right there, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.340]   We thank them for their support.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.580]   We have a winner.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:36.220]   The rose goes to Jeff Imelt, former chairman of GE.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.060]   We're talking about maybe, actually, it's only rumor, but it comes from Cara Swisher
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.060]   at Rico.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.060]   She knows everything.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.420]   The next CEO of Uber.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.140]   And I had sources on this as well.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.860]   I wound up writing about this for TechCrunch.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.660]   Cara definitely broke the news here.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.460]   But yeah, I mean, it's not for sure decided on, but my--
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.460]   The board likes him.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.460]   And that's a problem.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.300]   The board doesn't like a lot of people.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   Right?
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.420]   The board has a lot of issues right now.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.100]   I don't even know where to begin there.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:12.060]   But yeah, I think ultimately, I mean, I did hear from one source that he was a little
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:16.660]   disappointed because he didn't think that this would be the person they would have picked
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.140]   had they not been in this situation.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:23.900]   But given this situation, he thought it would be a good choice going forward.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:28.140]   Another source was fairly excited about Jeff.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:34.700]   So both of them felt that this wasn't totally decided, but it looked like they were getting
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.180]   close at Uber.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:39.980]   So it's not a woman.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.940]   I think early on, everybody was saying, well, to solve the problems Uber has, you've got
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.100]   to make a next CEO woman.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.100]   Do you agree?
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.420]   Um, I mean, I kind of have mixed feelings there.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:54.300]   I mean, sure, I would have been excited to see a woman in that job.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   But ultimately, I think they should pick the best person for the job.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.300]   And I think they have had conversations.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.020]   The best person who wants the job.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.020]   That's the other problem there.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.340]   They have a lot of complications here.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.540]   I think some of the best women for the job didn't want the job.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:14.900]   I mean, there were reports about Meg Whitman and then there were reports that Travis, the
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.540]   former CEO, he was telling people that he was Steve Jobs in it and that he might come
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.540]   back.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.540]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.540]   I was hit to quash that, by the way.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.540]   He immediately said, no, no, no.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.980]   He's like Travis Kalmanik is not coming back.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.980]   Sure.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:28.980]   But he's on the board.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   There's a little bit of this kind of manipulation going on with the shareholders and employees.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   Right.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   Totally.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   I mean, he's on the board.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:43.300]   So he still does have some voting power and he still has his friends in the company
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.180]   who are very loyal to them.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:49.860]   And I think some CEOs are actually many CEOs that would be qualified for this job.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:50.860]   Wouldn't want it.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.180]   They wouldn't want someone like that kind of watching over their shoulder.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.580]   And I don't know if he's hoping that they'd failed, but something is going on there.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.540]   And so Benchmark clearly didn't like it either.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.740]   That's their early investor.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.380]   And so there's a lawsuit there.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.660]   So it's interesting because when Sachin and Tella became CEO of Microsoft, everybody
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.820]   said, oh, you don't want that.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.900]   Balmer and Gates are on the board and magic.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.420]   But he made it work.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.540]   In fact, forced Balmer out.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.700]   But he made it work and he really transferred Microsoft.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.020]   So you could look at that and say, well, no, I think somebody.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.860]   So Emelt was the CEO at G.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.860]   Right.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.860]   Was he a good CEO?
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:32.140]   Well, the stock didn't do well at all under his tenure there.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.500]   But, but yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:41.740]   I mean, he seems to be a well, he seems to be a well respected business person.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:46.060]   I mean, he's a very large company that he was running.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.060]   He's amazing.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.820]   He's $223 billion market cap.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.780]   So it's like three Ubers.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:56.820]   So I mean, I guess from that perspective, he's been running a giant company.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:57.820]   He stepped down.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.820]   He ran it from 2001.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.100]   He stepped down in June.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.100]   He was there for 16 years.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.340]   He got them through the financial crisis.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   Oh, gosh.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   Where's the?
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.340]   Don't want to hear a video from you.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.340]   Thank you.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   Thank you for not doing that at TechCrunch.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.340]   Thank you.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   I appreciate it very much.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:20.020]   But yeah, so I mean, I think that there's a lot of mixed sentiment about him.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.940]   Obviously, he was there for a long time.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.940]   So he's good.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:23.940]   He's 16, Jack Welch.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:24.940]   He was a legend.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:25.940]   Sure, sure.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.100]   So, but yeah, I mean, what I did hear from one person involved with the company is that
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:37.380]   he didn't think that his background was the right background for a fast growing technology
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   company.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.660]   It's very different running a blue chip.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.660]   Like conglomerate.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.660]   Long time conglomerate.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.660]   It was not even public.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.660]   Right?
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660]   No, G was public.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.660]   No, no, Uber is not.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   Uber is not.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.660]   It's a startup.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   But they want to be.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.740]   They say they've said all sorts of things under Travis that they didn't want to be.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.540]   I mean, ultimately it's paper money until there's an exit.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.660]   And so unless someone wants to buy them for almost 70 billion, I think they're going
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.340]   to have to eventually go public.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.140]   What do you need to?
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140]   Who do they need?
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.180]   What do you need to put Uber back on the track?
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.820]   You've got lawsuits against Google's Waymo.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.420]   You've got the shareholder lawsuit or the investor lawsuit from Benchmark.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:21.300]   You've got what some say is a toxic bro culture.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.380]   And yet I have to say it's a strike.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   I'm saying that.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.780]   Many, many, everybody.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.980]   But I have to say, I still use Uber.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.780]   I'm ashamed to sometimes admit it.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.260]   I like Uber.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.980]   So you have a brand that's very successful.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:41.740]   Of course, it loses money on every ride.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.860]   It subsidizes the majority of the cost of that ride.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.220]   So it's not a big money maker.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.140]   This is a tough job.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.660]   The real business of Uber is self-driving cars.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.580]   So the current drivers are simply there.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.580]   That's what the market is.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.580]   To be meat robots.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.980]   That's what the investors are.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.980]   That's the deca corn.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   That's right.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.900]   Not because of the ride sharing.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.500]   But because someday, that's a big.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.500]   The whole model.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   It's like cut on costs when that happens.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   Yeah, but sad drivers.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500]   Yeah, because the cost of drivers.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.820]   I think they did say at one point that they're never going to get rid of all of the drivers.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.820]   But...
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.740]   Look, you're going to wait until they die out.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.460]   We're not going to replace any drivers who leave.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.060]   The thing to keep in mind though, this isn't about replacing the current world of livery
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.060]   drivers.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.660]   This is about replacing the current world of automobiles.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:31.620]   The future of self-driving cars is going to be an Uber-like model.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.620]   It's going to be...
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.900]   But is it going to be Uber?
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.900]   Is it going to be Waymo?
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.220]   Is it going to be Apple?
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.700]   Is it going to be...
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.300]   Let's not forget Ford General Motors.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:45.580]   I mean, there's a lot of companies that are probably better positioned frankly than Uber
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:46.580]   to do this.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.220]   Uber is a taxi company right now.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.580]   It's because they've done R&D.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.580]   They don't...
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:00.140]   Certainly Google has a huge lead in autonomous vehicles, right?
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.140]   Yeah, I would say so.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.380]   I don't know why Uber is seen as being...
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:08.700]   Well, because they brain-drained Carnegie Mellon and took some of the brightest minds
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:13.260]   in self-driving AI to come in and work on their company.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.700]   This is one of the biggest challenges right now is that so many companies are doing self-driving
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.820]   cars that the number of people who specialize in the many different areas of technology
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.780]   are really hard to get.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.780]   And Uber's got a lot of...
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.260]   Here's the problem.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.260]   Sure.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.620]   But they don't have enough runway to do it.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:33.900]   In other words, they're going to run at the burn rate they've got, which is billions
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:41.260]   of dollars a year, they don't have enough time to create a sustainable self-driving car
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.180]   ecosystem.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.500]   They can't turn that corner.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.740]   I don't think they have what it takes to turn that corner.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.940]   They may have the people, they may have the PhDs, but it's a lot more than that to make
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.260]   that happen, including by the way, regulatory issues.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.260]   And Uber's...
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.260]   There's a mix...
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.260]   They have a lawsuit with Waymo.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.260]   Google's self-driving car...
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.500]   Well, that's one problem.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:09.460]   Leven Dowsky, I think it's now kind of accepted, took Waymo's intellectual property.
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.460]   We don't know.
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.460]   That's the suit.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.460]   That's an ongoing lawsuit.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:18.900]   The move to self-driving cars is comparable to the move from horse and buggy to automobiles.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:24.620]   And during that transitionary period, there was all kinds of weird political, crazy, legal
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.620]   liability.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:30.060]   There was all kinds of stuff that now do not matter at all.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.860]   And a company like Tesla can come along decades after the automobile giants had already established
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860]   its quark.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860]   It's walking right in.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.180]   And is walking right in, is probably going to succeed.
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.140]   I don't think there's any reason to believe that Uber will or won't be dominant in the
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.820]   self-driving car industry.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.660]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.300]   Exactly.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.660]   If they were a lock, I'd say, well, they're worth it.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660]   But they're not a lock.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.660]   They're far from a lock.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.900]   In fact, I think they're going to have real problems because they're going to run out
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.540]   of money.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.780]   And I don't know, how many times can you go back to the well to do some best years and
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   say, hey, another 20 billion, and I think we might have this.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   You can't.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.980]   They've already gotten money from Saudi Arabia and all over the world.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.020]   So they're going to have to keep looking for rich people.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.380]   Now, I think eventually they're going to have to go public.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:17.540]   But it might be a down-around IPO, which is what we're seeing now when they go public
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.020]   beneath their last market valuation.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.220]   Their market cap will be likely smaller.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.860]   But we'll see.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:29.020]   I mean, these days, companies like Square did that and then they eventually did well
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.100]   in the soft market.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:36.100]   So it's no longer considered the end of the world if you do a down-around IPO, as long
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.820]   as you build a great public company.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:43.700]   A down-around is where you were by the venture capitalists said to be worth $100 billion,
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:48.140]   then you go out to the markets and they say, no, no, you're worth $80 billion or $70 billion.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.260]   So I mean, Uber was said to have last raised to $68.5 billion valuation.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.380]   That's often rounded up to $70.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.820]   It's really hard to justify that right now.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:06.700]   I mean, I personally thought it was always hard to justify that valuation, especially
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.660]   with all of this happening.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:13.260]   So if they went public today, I mean, there's almost no way that they would be valued at
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.260]   that.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.140]   But maybe if they wait a couple of years, they'll grow into it.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.340]   I mean, really it has to do with the public investors.
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:20.340]   What's their runway now?
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.060]   Do we know what their burn rate is and what kind of?
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.060]   They have shared some of those quarter-year numbers.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.060]   It's not long.
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.060]   It's a couple of years, three years.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.860]   I'm like, yeah, I'd have to take a look.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:34.060]   I mean, they've shared some of their financial numbers, but not all of them.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:38.620]   I mean, I think there are people who will still continue to invest in Uber.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:43.820]   I mean, reports have said that SoftBank, which has a $100 billion fund, is interested
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:44.820]   in investing.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.660]   And so they have money to keep Uber alive.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.100]   So I'm not worried about Uber going out of business.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.180]   I don't even think that's close to a possibility.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:59.620]   But whether it's going to achieve its private market valuation will be a big deal for the
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:04.220]   whole industry because a lot of LPs, the investors who get where VCs get their money
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.900]   from, are in multiple venture funds.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.060]   And if a lot of those venture funds were counting on Uber and it's not as good of an
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.780]   outcome as they thought it would be, then that's going to be a problem.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.540]   I mean, particularly for the investors who got in later.
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.420]   I mean, the investors who got in early, they're going to have a wonderful outcome, really
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.420]   no matter why.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.140]   It's just a matter of how many billions of dollars are going to be.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.940]   Millions will be worth, but...
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.380]   Calicanis is going to be insufferable after that.
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   Going to be insufferable.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.380]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:32.380]   I love you, Jason.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   You're going to be filling in for me next month, actually.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:39.300]   We watched with interest.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:43.340]   I feel like there's no indicator that Uber is the magic one.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.340]   No.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.340]   Right.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.180]   There's so many potential.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:51.380]   And if I were an LP at this point, I'd be hedging my bet with a lot of different companies.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.140]   Instead of pouring more money into Uber, I'd be maybe seeing if I could get a little
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:19:00.180]   money in that Waymo thing, a little money in that Tesla thing, a little money in Ford.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.980]   There's so many people out there.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.580]   And I don't think there's any evidence that you can turn that there's something magical
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:09.380]   about the taxi business that allows it to pivot into the self-driving car.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:16.540]   It seems to me that the experience of getting a ride in the self-driving world will be close
[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:20.580]   to or identical to the experience of being in your living room.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580]   That's a good point.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.780]   What Uber's doing right now would work either way.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.780]   Right.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.420]   But I think that Apple, and this is a fairly controversial point, but I think that Apple
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:33.500]   is going to be a dominant player, it's going to be, and if you don't believe Apple's going
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.300]   to get into the car industry, then you'll have to tell me what trillion-dollar industry
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.300]   they are going to get into.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.300]   They have to find one because they can't.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:44.100]   But the experience, you'll get into a car and let's say you have a 55-minute drive to
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   wherever it is you're going.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:53.540]   That's going to be 55 minutes of virtual reality, music of social interaction on HD video screens,
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:54.540]   all this stuff.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.300]   That's what is the transportation of your body from one place or another is going to
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.820]   be the least relevant part of this as far as the technology goes.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.020]   These are going to be little boxes that just take you to wherever you're going.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:15.020]   And in the meantime, it's a multimedia consumption experience that's similar to the smartphone
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.020]   which is now-
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.020]   There's nothing right now.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.060]   You're absolutely right.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:23.620]   What are you going to do when you're not driving, but you're sitting in this box for
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:24.940]   an hour or two every day?
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   You're going to be busy.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.940]   You're going to be busy.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.940]   You're going to be busy.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.100]   And it's going to be a huge revenue opportunity.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.900]   So I just think this is all farther off than we think.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:37.300]   And I think one of the problems is that governments are going to be very concerned about the safety
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:41.820]   issues of self-driving cars, and they're not going to just bend over and say, "Oh, yeah,
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:42.820]   yeah, just go ahead.
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.740]   Put all those self-driving cars on the highway you want."
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.420]   Well, they're supposed to be safer, I think, in the long run.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:51.700]   Part of the appeal is that they're going to cut down on accidents, since most of them
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.180]   are caused by human error.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.140]   Yeah, that's nice and logical.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.140]   No, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.420]   But tell a person getting in the car where there's no control.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.140]   Oh, no, you're safer.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:04.020]   You're in a box hurtling down the highway, but you're safer.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:08.420]   So I have to say, so I've been in Google self-driving cars when they were in highway
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   mode.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.420]   And after about 10 minutes-
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   You get used to it?
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.420]   Okay, yeah.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   You're talking to your friend.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.980]   You don't even notice that you're on the highway.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.540]   So I think that won't be the problem.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.220]   I think the argument that they are safer will definitely carry a lot of ways.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.860]   Is it safer when you mix human drivers with autonomous vehicles?
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.340]   That's the part I worry about.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:26.340]   Yes, it is.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.740]   I think it's the humans are the problem, not the robot.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.740]   Right.
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:34.460]   But I think it's going to seem how governments and how people adjust to that is going to
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.740]   be fascinating.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:40.860]   You talk about, like, I write a lot about the risks of living abroad and living in different
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.660]   countries.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:46.940]   And people are worried about terrorism, they're worried about crime.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:50.620]   Traffic accidents are vastly more dangerous than either of those things.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.020]   That will be one thing that will propel this is that numbers go up and it really becomes
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:57.100]   carnage in a few ways.
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:00.460]   People will be looking for a way out and we're going to just get more distracted.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:01.700]   We're not going to get less distracted.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.420]   We're just going to be worst drivers.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.620]   Every year we're going to get worse.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.740]   It's gotten worse.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:10.020]   For the first time in a long time, the highway death tolls gone up and I think it's going
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   to continue to go up.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   That will provide pressure.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:17.180]   I'm sure, look, I'm just thinking through stuff that all these investors who put billions
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.340]   into this company have already thought through and for some reason they've said, "Well, Uber's
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.340]   got it."
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.820]   Now, am I morally culpable for not getting rid of Uber?
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820]   Should I be riding Lyft?
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.820]   I have a lot of people who...
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.180]   Yeah, I know a lot of people who have bad man because of that.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.180]   Yes, you are.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.180]   You're a bad man.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.180]   I'm so confused.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   What do you do, Katie?
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:38.820]   So I did boycott Uber for a while.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.820]   Yeah, for a while.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.380]   Yes, after they got rid of a whole bunch of people, I brought it back.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.440]   The reason is because at my apartment, Uber insists...
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.500]   Lyft insists on dropping me off on the correct side of the street, which requires them to
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:57.140]   go all the way around multiple blocks, get in line for the freeway before picking me up.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.500]   It takes 20 minutes longer to get picked up for a time.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.300]   Uber doesn't mind breaking the law.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:08.340]   So I was late for months at a principal and then I was excited for now.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:11.900]   Let's play fast in the list with those traffic rules.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.740]   Katie's got to get to work.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:14.740]   Wow.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.020]   Do you find it just more convenient?
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.020]   I don't know why.
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.580]   I don't want to get in a Lyft for some reason.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.580]   Maybe it's just...
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   They don't make you do a fist bump anymore.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.580]   Oh, thank God.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.380]   And the pink mustache is gone too.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.580]   That's my cousin designed that by the way.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:27.580]   Oh, really?
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:28.580]   That's why.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:29.580]   Really?
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   I met the guy who was one of the mustaches.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   He's an idler.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:36.340]   He had a company before they were bought by Lyft that did the pink mustaches.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:42.260]   He's in charge of all of their stunts because Lyft does a lot of stunts for holidays and
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.260]   stuff like that.
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260]   I think he's...
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.260]   Unless he's lying to me.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.700]   No, I think that's the person I met.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   I invented it.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.700]   I invented it.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.700]   I think I met him.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:54.700]   I think I met him.
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:59.180]   He's a nice, good looking young fella about your age.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:03.740]   I don't know how I have a young cousin, but I do.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.980]   Our show today, let's take a break.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.980]   I want to take a break.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:10.460]   And I warned you, Katie, that this goes on and on and on, that we will be done before
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.460]   Game of Thrones.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.900]   This is tonight's the last night, right?
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.900]   Really?
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.900]   Winter is coming.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:15.900]   Holy cow.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.140]   And then we have to wait a year or what?
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.140]   I don't know.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.340]   It's a long wait.
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.740]   How long do we have to wait for the next...
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740]   Till the next leak?
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]   You can...
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.540]   Now see that I would watch.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.540]   Right.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.540]   So, the reruns.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.540]   Yeah, reruns.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.140]   No, I think it's going to be a while there because they haven't finished making the next
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:37.140]   episodes, so they think we have another wild wait.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.140]   Is next week the finale?
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   Oh, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   I don't know.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.780]   I thought we were the next week.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   Okay, whatever.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   Nobody knows.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:44.780]   Nobody knows.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.780]   I know.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.780]   Chat room knows.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.380]   If you missed, by the way, we had a great week on Twitch, and I thought it would be nice
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.220]   to show you a little home video of what happened.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.060]   Previous link on Twitch.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.140]   I want to go with a completely radical idea.
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.140]   Oh, what's that?
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.420]   Don't point your camera at the Daggum Sun during the eclipse pointed anywhere else.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:07.620]   What's much more interesting during the eclipse is how people are reacting to it, the reflections,
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.980]   the images you see.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.740]   All your friends are going to have those pictures of the sun with the little moon thing in it,
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.740]   and yeah, that's cool.
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:18.060]   But you could have pictures of things nobody else has.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.060]   Triangulation.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.660]   Do you remember the first time you spoke to Steve Jobs?
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.780]   Yes, he came back to Apple.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.780]   It was a mess, as you know.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:30.540]   Jobs calls my house on a Sunday night, and he starts giving me his spiel.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.100]   And then he started calling every Sunday night.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.020]   The first call my wife was like, "It's Steve Jobs on the phone."
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.620]   By the third call it was like, "It's Steve Jobs on the phone."
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.620]   You know.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.620]   No how.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.900]   Today on No How, we'll use billion dollar satellites to find cheap McDonald's toys.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:48.900]   Geocaching.
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.900]   Geocaching.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.340]   They might even find a Leo bubble head in a cache.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.100]   Who wouldn't want that?
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.380]   We're going to do an official Twitch geocache.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.380]   Nice.
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:03.060]   And we're not going to list it on geocaching.com until after a viewer finds it.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.060]   Twitch.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:08.860]   Coming to you from 38 degrees, 14 minutes north, 122 degrees, 38 minutes west.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.020]   It's really depressing.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.020]   No one found it.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.020]   Oh, really?
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.020]   Oh.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.020]   Right?
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.020]   Nobody has found it yet.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.020]   And then your people forgot where it is.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.020]   We...
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.260]   I know exactly where it is.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:25.340]   The next, like within a 12 hours somebody went and was there and was looking at...
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.500]   We have a video of him looking.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.500]   He never even...
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.600]   He didn't find it.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.620]   So a tip.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.820]   Lift up the base of the light pole and there's a bubble head under there.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.820]   It's depressing.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.380]   It's like nobody wants it.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.900]   Wonder why.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.580]   Anyway, that bubble head is still there if you want.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.260]   We've got to play out the little home version of our game.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.140]   Next week, a big, big week.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.780]   Jason Howell, what's coming up?
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.820]   This week on Monday, August 21st, yes, that total solar eclipse.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.020]   You've heard so much about will finally happen.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:01.500]   So I hope you've ordered your eclipse glasses to protect your eyeballs.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.700]   Almost as historic, maybe just a little bit less so is Google's official release of the
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.380]   next version of Android.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:11.580]   Android O or Oreo or Oatmeal Cookie or even Octopus.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.260]   Look, Google's getting really good at the trolling people on this.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.340]   So check for that news on Monday to find out what tasty treat will adorn new Android devices
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.500]   for the year to come.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.780]   Finally, on Wednesday, August 23rd, Samsung holds one of its biggest events of the year
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.380]   unpacked where it will unveil the Galaxy Note 8.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.380]   That's right.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:35.220]   It's been a full year since the Note 7 burst onto the scene.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.380]   No fans should rejoice.
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.580]   This one should not scar you for life.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.300]   That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.980]   Join Mega Moroni and me on Tech News today every weekday at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern

[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:59.980]   products come out for the last quarter of the year.

[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.500]   The question is, how do you do that?

[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.140]   I know some of you would prefer not to.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.500]   Never talk to anybody.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.940]   You can text message a certified financial planner.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.100]   They can assign one to you.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.700]   By the way, these are the guys who don't work on commission.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.460]   They're paid to look out for your interests.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.660]   So, they're giving you really good advice and they have a really great team of people.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.660]   You can call them.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:01.580]   You can visit them.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:05.060]   You can choose the level of interaction you want.
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.540]   So, that is really great.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:11.340]   270,000 customers now, billions of dollars under investment.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:15.300]   They are of all of these services, absolutely the best.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:19.980]   They've just added and I really love this is, I'm not SEC regulations mean.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.980]   By the way, fill that out because that's really cool.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:26.860]   SEC regulations say that I cannot invest in this and do an ad for them, which drives
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.660]   me freaking nuts.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:30.740]   So, I'm not a customer.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.420]   Hey, yes.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   Hi, Alex.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.660]   That's not a real person, by the way.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:40.620]   Alex is going to help you figure out very simple.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:41.620]   You can invest.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:46.660]   They've just added this, they have a socially responsible investment portfolio or SRI.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.740]   I really like that.
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:52.900]   In fact, I love the idea of saving for my retirement, but without harming the environment, they
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:55.140]   have really figured out how to do this.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.300]   You can reduce your investment in companies that don't meet certain social, environmental
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.620]   or governance benchmarks.
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.220]   You can feel good about your investments.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.700]   You'll always know what your net worth is.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.220]   In fact, you can sink in all your other investments and savings.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.620]   So, you completely know where you stand.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:13.500]   You pay the .25% annual fee.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:18.940]   That gives you unlimited messaging access to their licensed financial experts.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.180]   This is kind of my preferred way.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:24.380]   I still get the advice and information, but I don't have to talk to somebody on the phone.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.380]   And there's no selling.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.980]   It's just information.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:33.740]   If you do want phone access to their team, you upgrade and that's .4%.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.500]   They're a fiduciary.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.700]   So this is really important.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:42.300]   And I think you understand when I say it means they are working for you not on commission.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:44.700]   They are not trying to sell you products.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.900]   They don't have funds of their own.
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.140]   They do not at betterment.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:50.740]   They care about keeping your money and your data secure.
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.940]   They use, of course, the best state of the art data encryption.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:58.260]   Two factor authentication, of course, and really smart people who can help you in the
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:01.740]   way that you feel most comfortable.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:02.740]   Investing involves risk.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.380]   I'm not going to kid you, but you want to do it right.
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.100]   It's really a great system.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.180]   Get up to one year managed for free for a limited time at betterment.com/twit.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:18.860]   There are some conditions, but you can find out all about that at betterment.com/twit.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:22.180]   Lower costs, better investing, betterment.com/twit.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:27.620]   We think what your money can do and we're very happy to have them as a partner on this
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.140]   week in tech.
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:33.460]   Mike Elgin is here, his last chance to see him before he heads back to Europe for his
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.940]   gastro nomadic experience.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.940]   I'm intending to gain 20 or 30 pounds.
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.940]   This is what I don't understand about you.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.020]   You eat all the food I want to eat and look at him.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.220]   I don't get it.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.220]   Are you still doing this Spartan diet?
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   No.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.220]   Kind of, sort of.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:53.220]   Kind of, sort of.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.220]   I'm doing Spartan diet.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.220]   I don't eat.
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.780]   When I'm in the US, that's pretty Spartan.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:58.100]   When I'm in the US, I do.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.740]   When we're abroad, forget it.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.020]   You got hamoni bierico.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.020]   You got paella.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.020]   You're not going to.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.020]   No, you're not.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:05.020]   You're not going to.
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.020]   No.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.020]   It's road trip rules.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.020]   Exactly.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.020]   You're on a road trip.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.020]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.020]   That's right.
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.020]   I was in Disneyland the last two days.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.020]   I ate the most disgusting food in great quantities.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.020]   It was horrible.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.020]   Hot dogs?
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.020]   What did you eat?
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.020]   Oh, you know.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.020]   Goofy dogs they called them.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.940]   Goofy dogs, Monte Cristo sandwiches, churros, like churros.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.500]   There was one churro booth.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.940]   They had a churro cream ice cream sandwich and it said in really tiny print, some assembly
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.940]   required.
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940]   I'm not kidding.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:34.940]   All right.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:40.420]   So you buy it and they give you two churros in a circle and a thing of ice cream and you're
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.340]   supposed to put it together.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.140]   You need to warn you.
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.580]   I had to go back to the hotel room.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.580]   That's cooking.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:47.580]   It was a mess.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.580]   Yeah, that's a cooking.
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.580]   Once you combine it yourself, that's good.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.580]   You shouldn't.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:51.580]   You shouldn't need it.
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.580]   But I did go.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.580]   I went on all the new rides.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:54.580]   It was fun.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.580]   Had a good time.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:56.580]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.580]   Also here with us.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.060]   It's great to have her for the first time on Twitch.
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:00.060]   Katie Ruf.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.060]   It's so nice to have you in studio.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.060]   So far, are we doing okay?
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.060]   Okay.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.060]   You have a fun?
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.060]   Oh my God.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.060]   We're just beginning.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.060]   It started.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060]   Just I told you, we forgot to record.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.060]   We're going to do that over again.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:12.060]   You laugh.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.820]   That happened in the early days of Twitch several times.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:19.660]   It got to one point where I actually accidentally erased the same interview with the same guy
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.660]   twice.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.140]   Oh, no.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.500]   So once I called him back and we do it again.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.500]   He did it again.
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.580]   I somehow fumbled finger and I erased it a second.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:32.300]   I said the guy, this big basket of fruit and all that.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.620]   Two, one more time.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.100]   He was very generous and he did it.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.100]   Triple triangulation.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.100]   That was on floss.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   Actually, it was floss weekly.
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.940]   It was terrible.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:42.540]   I don't remember who it was, but I feel terrible.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.940]   Anyway, it's nice to have you, Katie.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:44.940]   Great to be here.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.260]   Senior writer for TechCrunch.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.260]   You see her.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.260]   We're here, her honor.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.380]   Do you do video inequity?
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.740]   We might do some on Facebook Live.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:53.740]   No.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:54.740]   No.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:55.740]   Too audio.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   Okay.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:00.340]   I have only one regret and that's we spent millions of dollars building a video.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.340]   You'd have to be insane.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.540]   You'd have to be insane to do this, Leo.
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:07.860]   It has no appreciable benefit, but well, it's fun for us.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:11.100]   Well, we enjoy it, but you listen to some of our shows.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.100]   You listen.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.100]   You don't want it.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.100]   No one has time.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.100]   Nobody got time for that.
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.100]   It's great while you're doing a run.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.340]   I don't know if I have a face made for podcasts.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.020]   You know, you're a good looking guy and you too look great.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.740]   You do those 30 day challenges.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   You lost a lot of weight.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.700]   You're just, it's because you work for the government.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.540]   You make no money and you don't have any food.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:30.540]   You live in a problem.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.540]   I call it the USDS diet.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.340]   We go to meetings all day and just skip lunch.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340]   No time to eat.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.740]   Do you still do the 30 day challenges?
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.740]   What's your challenge this month?
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.740]   Well, my 30 day challenge is not to wear a tie for 30 days.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.180]   In the government, in the government is hard.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:48.220]   I've only broken it once and it was a meeting with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.220]   I would wear a tie.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:51.220]   It's worth, you know, to show respect.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.220]   How do you not wear a tie?
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:55.420]   Well, August is vacation month.
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:56.420]   So everybody's gone.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.580]   So I'm wearing shorts in the office.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.780]   I like your challenges.
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.180]   See, that's the challenge I could do.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.180]   Now, wear a tie.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.180]   I could do that.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.820]   You can hear in Silicon Valley about it.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   You can pull that off.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.820]   No one wears ties.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820]   That'd be a good challenge when you're in Silicon Valley.
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820]   Wear a tie for a month.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820]   I wear a tie to work.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:12.820]   They say, are you interviewing?
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:13.820]   Are you looking for work?
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.820]   What's going on?
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.820]   Should we be worried?
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.300]   My first job in Silicon Valley worked for a startup and I showed up in a suit and tie.
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.140]   I was living in New York at the time and he looked me up and down.
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.820]   He's like, what are you wearing a suit for?
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.620]   I was like, well, it's a job interview.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:30.860]   He said, he's like, listen, I got one suit and it's a tuxedo for gathering awards.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.780]   Never wear a suit in Silicon Valley.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:36.580]   So anyway, this is a strange story.
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:41.140]   Supreme Court asked to nullify the Google trademark.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.620]   Oh, man.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.420]   Is the term Google to generic and then unworthy of trademark protection?
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:51.980]   The US Supreme Court is going to hear this case.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:58.820]   I wish I could bet money on this guy losing the guy named Chris Gillespie back in 2012.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:05.300]   He registered 763 domain names as one does as you do as you do that combine Google with
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.500]   other words, including Google Donald Trump.com.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.540]   This is Pressy at this 2012 Google.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:15.740]   Well, they fired filed a cyber squatting complaint under the uniform domain name dispute
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.740]   resolution policy.
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:21.180]   Of course, the acronym for that under me.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:29.740]   You know, you know, you know, you know, you sound like the Swedish chef when you claim
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.220]   trademark infringement.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:35.300]   Google won an arbitration panel order the forfeiture of the domains.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.980]   So Gillespie said, no, not so fast.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:44.540]   He sued ninth circuit court of appeals rule last year that Google's trademark should
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.620]   really be kept.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:48.540]   You know, it's Google.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:52.620]   This is even this is the court wrote, even if we assume the public uses the verb Google
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:56.420]   and a Jim generic and indiscriminate sense, but I would submit that before the Google
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.700]   came along, you never said the word Google and through mathematician talking about a
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:01.700]   million million.
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.380]   What is a Google billion billion?
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.060]   It's like one followed by a hundred zeros.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:11.580]   One with a hundred zeros, a Google and then Google Plex, which is a Google times Google.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:14.380]   I don't Google squared into the Google power.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:15.380]   I forget.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.980]   But it's not like this is I've unloaded that part of a cash.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.220]   It's not spelled the same anyway.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.220]   It's different.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.260]   But this has happened a thousand times before band days, clean acts.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.260]   I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:27.500]   So the theory being if you if people's just used it enough, it just genericizes.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:31.580]   It becomes a word, but they also take into account whether the company tries to protect
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.460]   its trademark, which by the way, Google has for years and years and years.
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:39.340]   And every three or four years, there's, you know, some Google's being a jerk because they
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:43.180]   send a letter to somebody that says, yo, you used it in a generic way, please don't do
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.180]   that.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:46.340]   So there's a long track record of Google protecting its trademark.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.340]   Right.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:49.220]   I've heard someone say they were yahooing something.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:53.140]   No offense to my sister company, but or binging something.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:59.620]   Briefly, Microsoft did run ads trying to convince president Trump uses the word bang a lot,
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.980]   but he's like, bing, bang, bang.
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.980]   That's bada bing.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:02.980]   Oh, bada boom.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.980]   Okay.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:04.980]   That's it.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:05.980]   All right.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.460]   Is generic side a word?
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.460]   It is apparently I like that word.
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.460]   That's a good word.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.460]   It's a form of abandonment.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.780]   A mark will be deemed to be abandoned if it's used to be discontinued for three years with
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.940]   the intent not to resume such use.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:24.180]   By the way, that's how we got the new screensavers trademark is NBC failed to renew screensavers.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.340]   They called us and they said, you can't use it.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.540]   And I said, well, have you ever heard the word, generic side?
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.540]   Turns out.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:32.540]   Gotcha.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.060]   When the mark becomes like Kleenex, like Xerox, a generic name for the goods.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.820]   Now Xerox for a long time really fought that spam.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820]   It's interesting.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:42.340]   Hormel for a long time.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:43.340]   They eventually gave up.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.380]   Does that mean they lost the trademark to spam?
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.380]   I think there's also areas where the trademark gets it.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:53.340]   So if you're talking about sliced and diced pork shoulder.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.340]   Right.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.340]   Lunch meat.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.340]   Lunch meat.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.340]   They own that.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.780]   But when you're talking about email spam, they don't care about it.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.780]   Genera side.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.780]   It's amazing.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.420]   So brands essentially destroy by their own success.
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:11.140]   The Supreme Court will rule whether Google has committed genera side.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:14.340]   Gillespie has appealed to the Supreme Court.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:17.500]   Now they haven't agreed to take up the case.
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.580]   In all likelihood, they're not going to go anywhere.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:24.300]   This is like the guy who says he invented email.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.300]   Right.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:30.300]   Which I'm sure he did and I would not in any case, want to assume that he didn't or
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:35.740]   assert that in any way he did not invent email when he was 12 years old and email been around
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:37.460]   for a decade or two.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:38.460]   He's probably right.
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:39.460]   A legend.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.460]   It's a legend.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:43.220]   Isn't that sad that we're all?
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.980]   Because he sued Techter, Mike Masnick.
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.580]   The good news is Mike now has a quarter of a million dollar defense fund thanks to some
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:56.940]   big companies that stood, stepped forward and said, this is the story of a guy who has
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.220]   for years asserted he invented email even though it's demonstrable.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.820]   The email existed before he invented it.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:08.820]   But he said, I think he says he invented it independently as a high school kid.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.820]   It's a strange story.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:13.420]   And unfortunately for him, he gets mocked a lot.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.060]   Unfortunately for the people who mock him, he also sues a lot.
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.900]   And so that case is ongoing with it.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.180]   There are always people who take advantage of things like that.
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:25.700]   But in general, I think that the whole world of litigiousness and American litigiousness
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:32.780]   in particular is probably generally a pretty beneficial thing.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.380]   Because it is, it is, it is.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.540]   Everybody gets their day in court.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.900]   Everybody is the right to say.
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:45.140]   If somebody in fact did invent something and they can take the biggest company to court
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:48.260]   and there's a chance that they could win a settlement where they'll get it.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.420]   It's one of the strongest nations I believe.
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:54.180]   And one of the things that's unusual about the United States is we've always been a
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.460]   very diverse society.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:59.540]   And this is a great strength and the majority Americans love our diversity.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:03.300]   In a diverse society, you have to have different norms.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.940]   For example, Americans smile a lot.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:07.940]   When I travel around the world, I see people smiling.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:10.940]   Americans, I can tell from across the street.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   Everybody else, they're not frowning.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:12.940]   That's right.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.260]   And the reason for it, there's been a study about this recently, is in a multicultural
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:20.100]   society where people come different languages, stuff like that.
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.700]   Smiling is the easiest thing that's universal that everybody understands.
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:26.060]   So we've gotten this habit culturally centuries ago to do that.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.060]   Another one is litigiousness.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   We all have different values.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.060]   We come from different places.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.780]   We have different opinions.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:36.380]   And so a courtroom is the closest you have to an objective place to determine these things.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.380]   And so it's a good thing.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:40.860]   Ridiculous lawsuits like this notwithstanding, it's going to happen.
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.500]   I agree with you.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.900]   There's a lot of money lost to patent trolls.
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.540]   I think that's gotten better, thank goodness.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:51.300]   But for years, and we were talking about billions of dollars lost to patent trolls, and yet
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:57.500]   I think it is so important that everybody have the right to go to petition the court
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.180]   and say, "I've been wronged and I would like you to rule on that."
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.180]   I agree with you.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.460]   And the rule of law in that notion is so important to the United States.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:10.540]   I remember traveling in Egypt on the same trip I was going down the Nile.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:14.900]   And there's a country where the rule of law has kind of lost ground.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.980]   It's very corrupt.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:22.340]   And there's a lot of backshish and you get a job because your brother-in-law works.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:25.940]   And what happens is people start to lose faith in that.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.700]   And then the whole thing kind of collapses.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:34.780]   Once you lose faith in that shared myth of a government, of a common cause, it's very
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.100]   hard to hold a country together.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:39.100]   And I knew, and it was obvious that Egypt was going to go through some troubles.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:43.940]   And this is 2009 because, not merely because of that, because of big population growth
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:44.940]   and other things.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.220]   But when you lose the rule of law, you've lost something really important.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:55.300]   People have to have some faith that no matter what, they can get redress.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:58.180]   It's not who you know that there's a chance.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:02.100]   Respect that the institutions of the society work the way that you expect them to and that
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   they're fair.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.780]   And I think that's why we're going to talk about this in a second.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:10.220]   But I think that's why in this country we're a little worried right now.
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:13.700]   Because it feels a little shakier that maybe that rule of law.
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:19.380]   But I think everybody who's listening, I really believe this strongly.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:23.300]   If you pick one strength of this country, it's not our military strength, it's this
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:29.260]   faith in the Constitution and the rule of law and that you can go and you can get redress.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:32.420]   So I'm glad you brought that up because I think we often talk about, "Oh, I've read
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.180]   they sue, sue happy and it's litigious and trial lawyers."
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.940]   But no, there are some negatives.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   I'm not saying it's perfect.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.940]   But on the balance, it really is what makes this country, I think, a great country.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:45.940]   Very lucky.
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.380]   And in the world of patents, that's problematic in two ways.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:53.580]   One is because the rules of the patent universe are completely messed up and everybody's talked
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:54.580]   a lot about that.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.060]   The other one is that you can sue locally.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.820]   So everybody goes to this one town in Texas.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:58.820]   That's changing though.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:43:59.820]   Exactly.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:01.220]   And so that's really good news.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:06.980]   That was, I think, a circuit court that ruled that you should, in fact, a company can sue
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:10.740]   in its jurisdiction, not in Tyler, Texas.
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.500]   And by the way, that was a business for Tyler, Texas.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.740]   The Peel Box industry was just amazing there.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.780]   And one of the reasons I bring this up, and we're going to take a break, but we'll come
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:22.660]   back because this is going to be the final topic of the day.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.660]   There's a lot of other stories.
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.260]   We only got to a little bit, but I do want to talk a little bit about the Daily Stormer,
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.740]   the Nancy website, which was first go Daddy kicked him out.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.740]   He said, "You can't register the domain here."
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.580]   They went to Google three hours later, Google said, "You can't go here."
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:37.580]   We have a sponsor.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:43.820]   We had a sponsor, CloudFlare, that got a lot of heat because they said, "We will continue
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:50.780]   to protect them as we do everybody, including ISIS because we provide a DDoS service that
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.780]   is ecumenical.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:57.620]   It doesn't, we don't, it's not about protecting the content, it's just about, and there's
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.620]   a big debate.
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:02.780]   The EFF weighed in on CloudFlare's side, which is interesting, and against Google and Go
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.780]   Daddy.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:07.580]   And I have got, since we have such a great panel here and a smart group here, I kind of
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:09.100]   want to know what you all think about that.
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.380]   Because this, I think, is related.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:17.300]   We have said free speech with very few exceptions.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:21.500]   And yet now we have big companies deciding who gets to speak.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.500]   Is that right?
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.500]   Is that okay?
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.500]   We'll talk about it.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.500]   Yeah, I mean, I-
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500]   Hold that thought.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.500]   Okay.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.500]   Hold that thought.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:29.500]   You don't get to speak.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:30.500]   You don't have the right.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:31.500]   I control the microphones.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.300]   No, no, I think it's a big topic and I want to give everybody a chance to kind of gather
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:37.300]   their thoughts.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:38.300]   I'll do a commercial.
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.300]   We'll come back.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.300]   I'm going to talk about the last topic that they were running at a time, but I really
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.500]   wanted to talk about this one.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:47.660]   I showed today, I brought you by LegalZoom, talking about the rule of law.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.620]   This is a great example.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:56.060]   When we started TWIT, 15, almost well-known, was it 2005, that's 12 years ago, I talked
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.060]   to Kevin Rose.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.220]   He said, "Oh, you got to do an LLC.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.220]   Go to LegalZoom.
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.620]   You don't need a lawyer.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.820]   They can do all the paperwork.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:03.820]   They provide you all the paperwork.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.420]   We did the trademarks that way.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:07.860]   They helped me start my business.
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.500]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.500]   They will provide you.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:15.860]   They can help set you up with pre-negotiated flat rate legal advice in all 50 states.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:20.340]   What they really are is there to help you in your life, whether it's your business or
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.340]   your family.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.540]   This is National Make a Will Month.
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.540]   August is Make a Will Month.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.540]   I think a really great reminder to everybody, especially if you have kids, but even if you
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:35.500]   just have a pet, you need, believe it or not, LegalZoom has the documents to care for your
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.780]   pet should something happen to you.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:40.820]   Preparing for your family's future is the most important thing you're going to do this
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.820]   summer.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.380]   It's time to think about it, even if you have a will, maybe time to update it.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.380]   They're going to make it very easy.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:49.900]   They've created an estate planning kit that's absolutely free.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.900]   There's no cost to you.
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.900]   Go to LegalZoom.com/prepare.
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:55.020]   LegalZoom.com/prepare.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.500]   I've got the kit.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.500]   It's great.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.020]   You're going to get lots of information.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:04.020]   They give you LegalZoom discounts too, of course, but that's great too.
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:07.580]   Everything you need to stop procrastinating and start preparing for your family's future
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.020]   doesn't have to be just wills.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:12.060]   It could be a living trust.
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.060]   Everything is in there.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.700]   You're going to get a state plan checklist.
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.900]   You're going to get an e-book information that help you decide what's right for you.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:22.180]   Again, and I love this, if you do have a question and you need to talk to a lawyer, you could
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:28.580]   do it not for $450 an hour, but at a low flat rate to one of the attorneys in LegalZoom's
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:29.580]   network.
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:33.660]   They're not a law firm, but they've got this kind of pre-negotiated deal with a network
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.460]   of attorneys in all 50 states.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460]   LegalZoom.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.220]   They've been around for a long time.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.740]   They sure help me.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:40.740]   They can help you too.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.740]   LegalZoom.com/prepared.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.980]   There's no obligation, by the way.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:45.940]   There's a completely free kit.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:49.620]   It's just great resources and discounts to help you during National Make a Will month.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.060]   I like this a lot.
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.420]   LegalZoom.com/prepared.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:58.780]   We thank LegalZoom for the help they gave us 12 years ago at Trademark.
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:01.260]   I don't want to commit genericide.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.860]   We're fighting that Trademark.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.420]   Actually, I don't want to.
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:06.420]   I can't talk about it.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:09.420]   We have pursued that Trademark in various places.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:12.380]   It's cost a lot more than LegalZoom did.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:14.740]   LegalZoom.com/prepared.
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:18.660]   All right.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:22.140]   Did I describe this situation accurately?
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:25.340]   If I may, Leo, I'd like to describe what the real issue is because there's a lot of
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:28.020]   people talking about lots of different things.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:35.100]   Companies like Google or CloudFlare or other companies do censor whatever they do.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.180]   For example, best example is child pornography.
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.860]   Everybody condemns it.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:46.380]   This is not something that should be allowed to flourish on the public internet.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:47.540]   ISIS is another case.
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:51.300]   Now, CloudFlare, you said, does support ISIS--
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.300]   I've been told.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.300]   I don't know.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:54.460]   I haven't talked to CloudFlare about it.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.460]   That's a legend.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.460]   That's really important.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.460]   They don't support it.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.460]   I think the important--
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:48:59.460]   Accept it.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:00.460]   Distinction is.
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:06.220]   It provides DDoS service to all and sundry, just like your electric company.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.740]   It doesn't ask you, well, what's your politics before they sign you up for electricity?
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:13.660]   Or the phone company says, well, you can use this phone, but you can't use it to describe
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.740]   Nazi activities.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:17.220]   Those are utilities--
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.220]   The difference--
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:23.780]   That traditional utilities are completely agnostic about the bits carried on there, right?
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:25.100]   But they don't trade in content.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.100]   That's the difference.
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:28.780]   Google, people communicate.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:29.780]   There's content.
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:33.420]   It's the web pages involved that have content.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:35.100]   So they're in different classes.
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:42.780]   The EFF is coming out against the Googles and the Facebooks and so on for shutting down
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.500]   Nazi groups, alt-right, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:53.580]   To me, the question is, we understand intuitively that you can't provide-- and we don't provide
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:59.220]   access for ISIS or child pornographyers to have groups on Facebook or to have--
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:00.220]   That seems reasonable.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.220]   Right.
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.220]   I think most people agree with that.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.220]   That seems reasonable.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.220]   Right.
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:05.220]   And the reason--
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:06.220]   To the degree they're able.
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.220]   I mean, when you've got a billion and a half or two billion--
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:08.220]   And the reason isn't speech.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:11.340]   It's not opinions about child pornography, is that we feel that that actually creates
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.020]   a harm to real people.
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:16.420]   Physical harm and ISIS is the same case.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:21.220]   So the question is, do Nazi and white supremacist sites lead to harm?
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:25.580]   Now, a lot of the speech that takes place on the storm, whatever they are, is innocuous.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:28.500]   They're actually talking about policies, immigration policies.
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.620]   They have their opinion.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.580]   And that kind of speech should be protected.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:36.500]   But the question is, is when they say let's go and like crosses, let's go intimidate,
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.620]   so and so let's shut down.
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:40.780]   Other people's free speech, let's go kill people, let's go do this, that, the other
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:41.980]   thing.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:45.060]   That seems to me to cross into that territory.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.900]   The speech is actually yelling fire in a theater.
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.660]   You're threatening harm to real people physically.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.740]   And that's the line.
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:53.740]   So I'm Jewish.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.940]   So this Nazi stuff is kind of personal.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:58.220]   I've read all about the history of the Holocaust.
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.380]   I don't get into that.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:05.860]   But I mean, it definitely, this kind of speech definitely led to a lot of violence clearly.
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:11.500]   And I think that the meaning of free speech has been distorted again and again.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.780]   It's supposed to mean that you legally can say whatever you want to say.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.540]   It doesn't mean people have to like what you say.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.620]   It doesn't mean companies have to do business with you.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:27.100]   But instead it's been used in a way that it's just not accurately portrayed.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:32.660]   No company should have to allow a Nazi site unless they have, I guess, a monopoly.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:36.780]   I don't think these people should go to jail for saying their hateful thoughts because
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:39.300]   I do believe in free speech in America.
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:44.660]   But I don't think Google should have to do business with them.
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:48.620]   I don't think cloud fair should have to do business with them.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:53.660]   I don't see why free speech has been equated to mean something just entirely different
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.660]   than what it's supposed to be.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:55.660]   Should cloud flare be?
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:56.660]   Let me read.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:57.660]   Let me.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:01.300]   I actually am torn.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.860]   But let me read what the EFF said.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:08.780]   And I am a strong supporter of the EFF and they are a strong supporter of free speech.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:14.060]   Now I should point out the ACLU just recently said we are not going to defend Nazis if
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.500]   they bear arms or advocate violence.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:21.060]   That's a change in the ACLU's policy by the way.
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.980]   This is what the EFF says.
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:27.380]   We strongly believe what GoDaddy, Google and cloud flare did here was dangerous.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:34.060]   That's because even when the facts are the most vile we must remain vigilant when platforms
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:39.620]   exercise these rights because internet intermediaries, especially those with few competitors,
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:45.260]   control so much online speech, the consequences of the decisions have far reaching impacts
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.020]   on speech around the world.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:49.460]   And the EFF, we see the consequences firsthand.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:54.820]   Every time a company throws a vile neo-Nazi site off the net, thousands of less visible
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:59.980]   decisions are made by companies with little oversight or transparency.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:05.340]   They worry that precedents are being set that can shift the justice of these removals.
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:11.020]   So I do think Google and GoDaddy are in a different situation than cloud flare.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:12.020]   Yes, they are.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:18.100]   I think cloud flare can very reasonably argue and I supported them in this although we decided
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:22.100]   to decline their advertising at the time.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.780]   They can argue we're a utility like an electric company.
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:28.260]   I wouldn't think the electric company should decide who gets electricity or the phone
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.860]   company should decide who gets phone service.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:34.060]   And I feel like that's kind of more what cloud flare is doing.
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:38.500]   Google on the other hand and GoDaddy, I don't know.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.500]   What do you think Matt?
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.380]   You have to use to when you work to Google, dealt with this all the time.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:47.460]   Well, and certainly from the time of Google, there's a bunch of folks who are not free
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:50.940]   speech absolutists but who think about the power of free speech and think about the power
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:52.740]   of the platform somewhere like Google.
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:57.260]   So having worked on the first version of safe search, for example, it was only dedicated
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:00.180]   to pornography, family safe content.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:02.660]   But you would see people come in and say, "Okay, that's great.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:05.540]   But what about the anarchist cookbook?"
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:07.580]   It's always weird you draw the line.
[01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.580]   What about a witchcraft or a wickensight?
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.100]   What about pro-anerexia sites?
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.700]   And you could just see the slippery slope down there.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:18.300]   And so it was easier to just say, "Okay, safe search would only be about this topic."
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.300]   Is that fine?
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:20.300]   And over time.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:22.060]   I think we could all agree on or mostly agree on.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.420]   No one's going to agree on the free speech.
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:24.420]   Well, look at Twitter.
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.580]   Twitter, the free speech wing or the free speech party, right?
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:29.780]   Look at how out of control it got.
[01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:34.060]   So I know that there are debates happening internally at Google where people say, "Okay,
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:36.260]   but where exactly does this line happen?"
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:41.500]   Because if you locate your website on blogspot or WordPress, then you're not surprised if
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.940]   WordPress takes you down.
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.740]   Because they're hosting the content.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:45.740]   They're hosting the content.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.900]   But if you have your own domain name, it's really interesting to think about, "Can I
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:50.900]   be picked off the Internet?"
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:54.460]   Yeah, as a registrar, what does a registrar are doing when they're not really saying,
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.620]   "We're hosting the content.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.900]   They're not endorsing the content.
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:59.500]   They just allow you to register the name.
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:02.060]   I don't know if a domain registrar should be able to do that."
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:04.300]   And I think clouds are going even a step further.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.300]   I don't know.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.300]   It's difficult.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:09.460]   Well, because at the same time, the daily stormer is reprehensible.
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:13.220]   And the thing that got them in the most trouble was true—I don't even want to repeat it—was
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.620]   truly beyond the pale.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:20.780]   And any right-minded society would reject it.
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.780]   Right.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:27.740]   So my view is that the First Amendment doesn't give anybody any rights at all.
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:33.700]   What it does is it says the government cannot pass a law.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.700]   Any company can do it.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.020]   It doesn't mention companies.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.700]   It doesn't mention citizens.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.740]   It says Congress cannot pass a law that infringes free speech.
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:47.660]   And if there's no law, then the executive branch can enforce such a law, et cetera.
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:53.260]   And so the way to deal—so yesterday was an amazing event that took place in Boston.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:54.260]   Amazing.
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:59.020]   So a small number of people were there to ostensibly promote free speech.
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:01.340]   And they were sort of alt-right types.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.380]   And there was like 50, 75—I don't know how many.
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:05.380]   They were fewer than 100 of them.
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:07.060]   They fit in the bandstand.
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.540]   They fit in the bandstand.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:17.380]   And then 40,000 people marched to oppose Nazi types and that sort of thing that happened
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.500]   in Charlottesville.
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.020]   Everybody was exercising free speech.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.860]   It was a thing of beauty.
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:31.060]   But the point I'm getting to is that it takes a village to destroy the Nazi movement.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:36.900]   And so part of that village, I think, is Google and Facebook and these other companies.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:40.460]   They are companies that are—they're not privately owned.
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:44.820]   They're publicly owned, but they're publicly owned by lots of individual people.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:51.980]   And we as shareholders, as customers of these companies, I think have a duty to examine
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:55.660]   these things as we're doing on the show right now and think, "Where is that line?"
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:57.500]   And I think the line is physical violence.
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.940]   This is the line that Twitter uses to determine who they boot off the site.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:04.100]   If you threaten physical harm, then you're out.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:08.340]   If you say all kinds of horrible, horrible, anti-Semitic things, you're not out because
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:09.340]   that's speech.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:11.260]   You haven't threatened anybody's physical life.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:17.220]   So I think that physical harm is really the line that most societies can accept as the
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:18.220]   line.
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.540]   Because it leads to physical harm.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:20.540]   Can we agree?
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:25.900]   I just think companies should be able to do business with whoever they want to do business
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:26.900]   with.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:32.500]   Generally, it's best for business to do business with a lot of people if you're consumer-facing
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:33.500]   business.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:39.620]   But I don't see why there should be any sort of regulation or any sort of rule that requires
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:41.860]   them to do business with Nazis.
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:46.220]   They're not preventing free speech unless they actually have a monopoly.
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.860]   Because someone else can take their business in theory.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:56.420]   And yet, Google and Facebook—not GoDaddy, Google and Facebook wield a lot of power.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:57.420]   What?
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.140]   I mean, not monopoly power admittedly, but—
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.140]   Close.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:06.700]   So much so that there is some concern that if they were to—especially in search results,
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:10.820]   if Google were to decide, "Well, we're just not going to show this stuff up," it wouldn't
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.460]   exist in effect.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.340]   You wouldn't have to get the host to take it down.
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.380]   In fact, that's what the right to be forgotten is in Europe.
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:19.580]   You don't go to the host to say, "Take it down."
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:22.860]   You go to Google and say, "Could you delete that from your search results?"
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:24.460]   In effect, that deletes it from the Internet.
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:26.980]   I admit it's not, but it does in effect, right?
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:31.260]   Well, and at least a lot of the people at Google tend to have the philosophy or had the
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:35.060]   philosophy of the answer to bad speech is more speech.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.740]   I believe that better idea went—
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:40.460]   I believe that, but I don't know where it actually changed.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:42.460]   When you're dealing with Nazis, that's—
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:46.460]   I used to say that when the Internet started, I said, "This is going to be great because
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:50.540]   we're going to expose everything to the light."
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:56.220]   In the light, bad stuff will die and good stuff will survive and prosper.
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:57.620]   What is the reality?
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:58:58.620]   What have we learned?
[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:02.780]   In fact, we gave a megaphone to— I think these are small groups.
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:08.780]   I think these neo-Nazi groups are actually fairly small groups, but we gave them a megaphone
[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.300]   that gave them an outsized voice.
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:15.220]   It didn't have the effect that I thought it would, which is we would all go, "See
[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.300]   how dopey they are?"
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:23.220]   I remember we've had Klan marches my whole life, and they usually were small, dopey groups
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.420]   that everybody would go, "Yeah, the Klan."
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:32.020]   But it doesn't feel that way anymore, especially with the death of a young woman in Charlottesville.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.620]   They somehow crossed the line.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:38.100]   Now the— Look at Spotify's removing hate bands from its library.
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:42.300]   Squarespace says it's removing sites from Squarespace.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:48.020]   Increasingly, the internet is stepping forward saying, "You crossed the line."
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:52.220]   What is the connection between the driver of that car in Charlottesville and the speech
[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:57.020]   that was taking place on the weekly storm or whatever it is?
[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.420]   It's probably a direct line.
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:00.260]   I mean, I'm surprised it wasn't a lot more violence.
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:04.780]   Well, and in fact, the final straw that knocked him off as a cloud flare, and I think
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:10.700]   of other places, was in fact a really horrific article about the woman who was killed.
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:12.420]   Afterwards, afterwards.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:14.180]   So there was that line in that sense.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:19.940]   They were absolute— We've seen now the effect of trolling the effect of, I think to some
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:24.180]   degree, both— I hate to say it, it sounds like I'm very Trumpian here.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:31.180]   But both the alt-right and the anti-fah, the anti-fascist league, are I— sometimes
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:38.940]   I feel like opposite coins are the same kind of 4chan lulls group.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:46.780]   The difference is that the greatest generation is the greatest generation because they fought
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:47.780]   Nazis.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:48.780]   Yes, exactly.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:53.780]   I mean, from an ideological perspective, they are not equals by any means.
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.460]   Obviously, I don't condone any sort of violence.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:01.820]   But to put them on the same moral plane as Trump has been accused of, I think is really
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.580]   reprehensible, especially coming from the White House.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:09.300]   When he backed down, I think his recent tweets are celebrating the protest that's
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:10.300]   very confusing.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.540]   Yeah, it's very confusing.
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:13.740]   That's very confusing.
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:19.660]   But anyway, to leave Trump out of it, I feel like a line was crossed.
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:22.780]   And there was a convulsive reaction by the internet.
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:25.340]   It definitely galvanized a ton of force.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:29.340]   And everybody said, "No, you went too far."
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:30.940]   We believe in free speech.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:34.460]   I think free speech has been well served.
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:39.500]   We believe in free speech, but the minute you cross that line, it's not okay.
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:45.700]   Yeah, and nothing has no cultural thing of any kind, has no context.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:47.220]   There's a big context in all this stuff.
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.220]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:51.180]   So we talk about alt-right, white supremacy, and neo-Nazi.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.180]   Let's look at those.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:55.420]   Alt-right, there are a lot of alt-right people who are just extremely conservative.
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:58.540]   Dick Cheney is probably alt-right.
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:01:59.540]   White supremacist.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:02.380]   This is an objectionable set of ideas.
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:04.740]   But probably, they are ideas.
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:05.940]   They're talking about policy.
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:11.180]   They tend to take the victim approach saying, "Oh, we need to protect our own people."
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.660]   Stuff like that.
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:16.140]   When you get an neo-Nazis, so there's a history with Nazis.
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:20.460]   It's like when you have Nazi symbols and doing Nazi salutes and have swastikas on your shirt
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:23.820]   and stuff like that, you're talking about supporting genocide.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:24.820]   Exactly.
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:26.340]   And that's why I think it's to donning violence.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:27.340]   Exactly.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:31.100]   I think there are a number of these are just kids who don't know any better and they've
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:32.780]   been playing too much Call of Duty.
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.300]   So they're too much time in their basement.
[02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:36.420]   So we teach them better by kicking them off Google?
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:37.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:38.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:39.420]   There are consequences.
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:44.580]   Did you see the video of the kid who took his shirt off to high because he got the disappear?
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.580]   He got docks.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:46.580]   No, no.
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.140]   He was at a protest and had his white shirt on, you know, signaling when he went.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:53.020]   And then somebody started chasing him and he took the shirt off very quickly and he
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:54.020]   just went into the crowd.
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.020]   I think there's a certain...
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.020]   I don't know.
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:01.860]   Well, actually, this whole, that event to me is a reason why you don't want to kick
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:02.860]   them off too much because...
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:03.860]   You want to know who they are.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.940]   Well, you want them to interact with other people.
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:10.580]   So one of the things that I feel that happened is these, these, these a-holes have been talking
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:15.380]   to each other and nobody else for a few years in a vacuum and they went out into the real
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:21.180]   world with their, with their worldview and they just got trash, especially in Boston
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:22.180]   yesterday.
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:25.100]   They just got just their butts handed to them.
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.820]   Because the real world isn't like their little message ports.
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.180]   And that's a good thing.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.180]   Exactly.
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.940]   So, you know, to certain extent you don't want them on the dark web where nobody can
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   challenge them.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:34.940]   That's one of the hard...
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:37.580]   You know, that was kind of the idea was sunlight disinfects and that was one of the arguments.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:42.460]   It's just that we've also seen horrific behavior in public and I don't.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.700]   I just, this is a tough one.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.060]   I'm hardened by the reaction though.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:47.060]   I really am.
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.660]   I guess I am, but I also understand why the EFF is disheartened because that could set
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:52.660]   a bad precedent.
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:53.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:54.660]   I mean, that's...
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.660]   It's tough.
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:56.660]   I think you're right.
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.660]   It has to be case by case.
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:59.980]   I think that's what CloudFlare CEO said.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.820]   You know, this is the, we're going to do this once and once only to these assholes is
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:05.020]   where he used.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.820]   And then we're not going to do it again.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:07.820]   Right.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:13.900]   Because I think Matthew Prentice, the CEO really believes that they should be a completely,
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:17.100]   you know, independent, not blind service.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.860]   Well, and it seems like he was saying, we're going to do this once.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:26.260]   And then in the space that that creates where things calm down a little bit, think about
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:27.260]   the policy.
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:28.260]   Right.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.260]   What are the implications and, you know, what's the general...
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.180]   I kind of honor that.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:32.540]   I think that's a, this is a very hard thing to do.
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.620]   I know Google struggles into this.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.300]   I'm sure Facebook struggles with this all the time.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.260]   And it's a very hard thing to do.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.500]   Anyway, I wanted to bring that up at the end.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:45.500]   I think it was so great that we had this conversation and I'm really thrilled that you
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:47.900]   were all here before at Katie.
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.060]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:51.060]   Talk something.
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.060]   TechCrunch.com.
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:53.700]   Katie's got a lot of bylines.
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:54.700]   Equity.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:57.060]   Equity is our podcast.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:59.060]   Anything else?
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:00.300]   Your favorite TV show?
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.300]   Your favorite color?
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:03.300]   I know anything you want.
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:04.300]   Okay.
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:06.100]   My favorite color today is Olive.
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:07.100]   That's a good color.
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.100]   It's a good color.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.100]   Or TechCrunch screen.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.100]   How about that?
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:11.100]   TechCrunch screen.
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:12.100]   I love it.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:16.020]   Mike Elgin is on, of course, Twitter as Mike Elgin.
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:18.420]   He's on the Google+, he's everywhere.
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:21.460]   He's on Fast Company and he's on a computer world.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:26.140]   But got to go to Gastronomad.net to find out what he and Amir are up to because it's
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:27.140]   awesome.
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.140]   That's right.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.240]   Awesome, awesome.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.540]   Have a great time and bar so long.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:32.100]   I certainly will.
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:35.700]   And don't worry, Leo, I know you're going to be missing out on a lot of really good
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.700]   food.
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:37.900]   I'll eat your portions for you.
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:39.620]   So you don't have to.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:40.620]   Thank you.
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:41.620]   You're welcome.
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:42.620]   And I'll just be looking on Instagram.
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:43.620]   Yes.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:44.620]   And drooling.
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:48.380]   Matt Cuts, thank you so much for what you do for the US Digital Service and all of
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.700]   us in the United States.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:56.100]   Matt is the Acting Administrator for the USDS where they are changing the government's
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:59.180]   relationship with its people by making the tech work better.
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:01.100]   And that is really, really important.
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:03.780]   It's meaningful and inspirational.
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.180]   I was talking to some people from the team earlier this week.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:11.180]   And there is one part of the process where someone who is a veteran and doing a disability
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:15.900]   claims appeal can get stuck in a queue that lasts nine to 12 months.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:20.580]   And just by writing some code to do some checking, there's the possibility to shave
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.780]   that nine to 12 months for people who really need it.
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.740]   Like you're over 85 years old or you have a life threatening illness where that really
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:31.660]   makes a difference between when you might be able to, you know, get through a difficult
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.340]   situation versus be homeless.
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:37.540]   So if that's the sort of thing where you might be interested in somewhere that renews
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.740]   your spirit and has a really big impact, come check us out.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:43.100]   And what is the typical length of a tour of duty home?
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:46.580]   Well, I signed up for three months and then extended to six months.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:49.300]   And now it's been over a year that I've been there.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:53.220]   But a lot of people will come for one year and then extend for another year.
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.700]   Nice.
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:55.700]   Read all about it.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:57.540]   Go to usds.gov.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:05.500]   And if you'd like to help out usds.gov/join and you can help.
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:09.460]   And the last time you were on this week in Google, a number of people said, you know
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:10.460]   what?
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:11.460]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:13.340]   Great applications after I was on the podcast.
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:14.340]   I was like, you know what?
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:17.300]   When I'm back in California, I should come say, oh, you're back.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.260]   So let's make it 20 this time.
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:20.820]   Everybody, it's such a big help.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:22.900]   Do you have to go to DC to do it?
[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:26.780]   We do have, in fact, there are some folks who are helping veterans affairs who are out
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:27.780]   on the West Coast.
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:31.380]   But normally it's helpful if you come to DC because that's where you have the meetings
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.180]   with the secretaries and the cabinet folks and all those money.
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:35.180]   You might be able to do that.
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.180]   That's pretty cool.
[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:37.180]   It helps.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:38.180]   Yeah.
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:39.180]   Thank you, Matt.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:40.180]   It's really great to see you.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:41.180]   Thank you.
[02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:42.180]   Thank you.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:43.860]   We had a wonderful studio audience today.
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:47.220]   You were very patient with us.
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:52.900]   If you want to join us in the studio audience, bring a water bottle, some survival bars, some
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:56.340]   K rations and email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.300]   We would love to put a chair out for you.
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:01.820]   You can also watch live on our live stream, twit.tv/live.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:05.020]   If you do that, please join us in the chat room at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:10.700]   Great bunch of people in there kind of kibbitzing along with the rest of the crew, always valuable
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:13.340]   to us to keep an eye on what you think.
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:16.820]   If you can't watch live or be here live, you can always get on demand versions of everything
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:19.740]   we do on our website, twit.tv.
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:21.020]   You can download it there.
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:25.740]   My favorite thing to do though, and I would ask you to do it if you can, is subscribe.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:30.340]   We've noticed a lot of people don't subscribe anymore because it used to be you had to.
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.740]   You like to subscribe on iTunes.
[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:32.740]   You hook up your iPod.
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:34.900]   You sink it into all of that.
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.340]   And nowadays it's really easy to stream it.
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:40.340]   So a lot of people will fire up an app and sometimes they'll be in their car and there's
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:44.660]   something on the dashboard of the fire up an app and listen to individual shows.
[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:47.700]   And that makes sometimes our downloads very spiky.
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:48.700]   You know what I do, Leo?
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:49.700]   I'm main-lining it.
[02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:52.860]   Please, I subscribe to the Alt which shows.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.860]   Thank you.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:54.860]   Thank you.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:55.860]   And it's awesome.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.420]   But you have to listen to them all as well.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:58.420]   That is not possible.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:01.580]   I don't even know how we make this many.
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.500]   We would love it if you would subscribe.
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:05.260]   Just find your favorite podcatcher.
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:09.540]   A lot of people with iTunes, but so Pocketcast is number two I found out, which is great.
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.580]   Going down to the podcast movement, which is the big trade show in Anaheim on Thursday
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:16.020]   and Friday.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:22.460]   And I hope to meet a lot of podcasters down there and a lot of podcast supporters.
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.460]   Look forward to it.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:25.260]   If you're there, come say hi.
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.900]   And we'll see you next time every Sunday for the show.
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:31.220]   First Sunday, why do I keep saying Thursday?
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:37.260]   Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC for this weekend tech.
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.300]   Thanks for being here.
