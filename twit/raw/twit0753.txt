[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.440]   We're all back from CES. Jason Heiner is here from CBS Interactive Tech Republic's
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   CNET editorial director at CNET. Jason, it was so nice to see you. We saw you at the PEPCOM digital
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.640]   experience very first day. It's so dapper, so naddy and your little pork pie hat and you're
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.840]   so, so sharp looking. It was so nice to see you. Great to see you and Aunt. Yeah, we got to catch
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.760]   up for a few minutes and yeah, it was lots of fun. Yeah, and great to see you guys. And so Jason,
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.000]   was it CES? Aunt Prout and I were there with our excellent adventure which turned out to be less
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   somewhat less than excellent. I don't know. I'm still going to call it excellent. I'm still going
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.240]   to call it excellent. Aunt Prout is of course the host of Hands on Photography,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:37.880]   Focus on Photography and shows to be named later. He's also wearing Clem's in Orange because tomorrow
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.000]   it's the National Championship. Last year at CES while we were there,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   Aunt was there and the day after the National Championship, I remember at least 100 people
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.480]   giving Aunt like a high five because he was wearing his Clem's and if I remember that right, Aunt?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.920]   Yeah, that is correct, sir. It was a glorious day. And there's a lot of Clem's in the NFL too.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.080]   I have to say every time. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. It is. So Aunt and I were there, we'll talk about that
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.560]   and then Father Robert Ballis, Sarah the digital Jesuit was also there. They let you out of the
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:24.440]   Vatican. Oh dear. To come to CES. I am not wearing Clem's in Orange and this is not 49er
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.880]   red. You're not wearing your collar. I thought you had to wear it. Didn't they make you wear your
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.400]   collar? You're trying to get fired. They're all the way over in Nevada. He's trying to get
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.600]   fired. He's actively not. So I'm going to ask you about the Minecraft server because you were
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   I you were on my local news. Yeah, I know. Digital digital Jesuit. Father Robert Ballis
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   Eric creates the Vatican Minecraft server and it's hacked within 24 hours. It wasn't hacked. It was
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   DDoSed. It was DDoS. So it was this is how it started. When the last time I left the United
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.760]   States in August late August, I just sent out a tweet and said, Hey, would anyone here like a
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.800]   non-toxic gaming environment? And if so, what game would you like me to set up? It was Minecraft.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.320]   Of course. Of course. Was minecraft. You probably wanted to do rest though. I kind of love
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.360]   rest. But that's not non-toxic. It's not non-toxic. But we had managed to make a non-toxic rust server.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.480]   It's just it takes a lot of moderation and a lot of input. Yeah. So I set something up for, you know,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.760]   20, 30, 40 people just just enough for for people to play around with. And then it got picked up by
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   a local outlet. And overnight we went from 20, 40 people to 5,000 people. Yeah, because it's the
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   Vatican because it was in the. You also tweeted it. And because I tweeted it. Correct. And then we
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.520]   had a semi-toxic YouTuber who jumped on. Of course. And he immediately got banned because he was
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.160]   cheating. He was hacking. And then all of his followers decided was it OMG Chad? No.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.560]   I won't I won't mention them. I won't mention them. But I will say we almost got DDoSed off the
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.120]   internet and then Cloudflare reached out there. Yeah. President there's the EO reach out. As
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.400]   you prince is awesome. We'll protect you. Yes. We're big fans. Yeah. So there's we're still running.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:11.320]   We're we're now up to we've got 17,000 unique users. We are now also running Rust and TF2.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.000]   Oh, are you? And we've got something like.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.800]   And you have to 18,000 people in our discord. So we're going to run Gary's mod. I mean, you're
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.480]   running TF2. We're running TF2. Notice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have a very active discord
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   server. I wanted to sign on so I could chat with you. But you're too you're too big of a star to get.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.280]   Uh, no, I think I think we could take care of that. There's there actually is there's a role in my
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.840]   discord server for super awesome Twitter people. Oh, I'm not even joking about that. So all of that
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.600]   if you go to father's Twitter handle with pottery SJ, you can see all the links and everything if
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.680]   you want to get involved in that. Some beautiful stuff they're building in there actually. That's
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.360]   that's been the most amazing thing. So you have a creative server, but you also have a PVP server.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.840]   Five servers. Do you have a survival server? And yeah, so you have all the different.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.240]   That's actually one of the keys to making a non-toxic environment. We give we have a server no
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.280]   matter how you want to play. Right. Because I I do both. I like creative though. And I noticed that
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.920]   Michael our kid 17 year old and his friends. They still like to build. And it's amazing what they've
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.720]   built. It's amazing what people built there. It really is like Lego. It's more like Lego than a
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.360]   game. It's like it's a creative outlet and in creative mode, you're not trying to survive or
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.960]   anything. You just get all the bricks. You can use all the different types and you put it together
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.400]   in unique and beautiful way. I will say that I was surprised by how many people build cathedrals.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.560]   Well, it's the Vatican server. But no, no, even when it wasn't the Vatican server,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.480]   so many people were building these huge cathedral like structures. I'm like, is that is that the
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.520]   pinnacle? It's nice because instead of taking a hundred years, the thousand wertzmann.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.120]   Do it overnight. We got it's true. Michael's friends are building a sewer system now. They
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.600]   decided they had underground stuff for the lighting they were using. And but then they said, we should
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.240]   also have some sewers. And so they have an infrastructure as well as buildings above.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.960]   It's crazy. But I think that is to me, that's a game. That is a great game.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:15.080]   Anyway, it's great to have you. Great to see you. CES was all last week. None of us are sick.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.600]   This is an unheard of proposition. Hey, this is the incubation period. We're still within it.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.240]   Oh, we're still still happy. So technically could be carriers. That's fair.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.440]   I haven't been in eight years. And I one of the reasons I didn't go for so long.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.080]   Partly is it's just a nightmare. In fact, a lot of, you know, last week I asked my panel, how many
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   of you are going to see as a none of them are going? Because they're all senior enough in
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.440]   tech journalists. They don't have to go. Nobody imposes on themselves like we did. And right,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.760]   that's nuts. Or like you guys do. All of you could have recused yourselves. There's something
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.960]   fun about it though. I liken it to a football game. If you go to an NFL game, you go for the
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.800]   atmosphere for the fun, not to see the game. You could see it much better at home on your TV
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   than you can. And you know, even if you have good seats, because it's distant and it's people
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.080]   running around and it's and CES is like that. You can only get it's like the elephant and the
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:22.360]   blind men. You can only get it's 4,500 booths. That means, you know, more than 12,000 products.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.960]   You only have so much time. It's impossible in four days to even scratch the surface.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.360]   Right. So, you know, you'd be better off if you care about CES to let everybody else go,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.320]   read all the coverage. But if you want to get the so once in a while, I think it's fun to go.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.240]   Mm hmm. Get the atmosphere. All of you go all the time, right? I go for the swag. Yeah.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.000]   He's just you brought some swag. I'm pretty good at getting so. You know,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.480]   when I when I first started going, I could remember prior to actually being able to go,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.280]   hearing folks like yourself and other senior. Oh, I could never go.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.920]   Oh, I don't want to go back. It is. Because it sounds like really, but after going
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:07.160]   two two times or so, I could see why you would feel that way because it is a grind. It's hard.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.640]   Oh, yeah. You are running around. It's hard to get around shoes. And if you're covering it,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.840]   if you're, it's easier if you're not working it. Right. If you just said it, we're just hanging
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.880]   out and that's actually fun. Right. But if you're working, you feel an onus to guy see as much as
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.520]   possible. Right. I think I went to North Central and South Halls. I went to the Sands Expo Center.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.400]   I went to the Venetian. I mean, and I and I still didn't get to Mandalay Bay and I still missed
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.680]   thousands of products I wanted to see. Right. Jason, how do you do it?
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:41.800]   Well, we have 90 people. So we do it is we cut it up into little chunks and we, you know,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:50.360]   we try to get down every aisle of every, you know, every exhibit. Do you do it by beat? Do you say,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:57.080]   okay, Lexi, you're going to cover health tech and stuff like that. Yeah. We do. It's by and large,
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   but then we still even have to slice and dice it, right? Because there's some that have overlapping
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:08.280]   beats. There's some things there that is in nobody's beat. And so we have to really be
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.920]   strategic about the way we are. Would you put the charge of the sex toys?
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.960]   That's how we have a culture team. So it's actually true. We have a culture team. And then
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.600]   we also have a team that's focused on health and wellness. This was a big story partly because it
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.800]   has the word se x in it. But this is a big story because last year, the Consumer Electronics
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.680]   Association, which runs CES inadvertently gave an award to a vibrator, then yanked it.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:44.360]   Pull it back. No, no, not that he's answered it. Thank you. And and got a lot of heat. In fact,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.880]   the company that created that and won the award and then lost the award was smart and went out,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.280]   did I press releases went on a tour, they got more coverage than they would have otherwise.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   And I think the CEA said, oops, that was a mistake because we've allowed, you know,
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.720]   they used to have adult corner where they'd have adult videotapes in there, right? Eventually,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.400]   they had to exile that across the hall. But it was very sexist that they said, well,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.000]   you can't have women's health products, but you can have men's exactly.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   Right. They just tried to treat it like adults this year. I think that's the thing.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.200]   I think that was better. Now, of course, I'm the one who's not.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.920]   So, did you see it again? So there were 10, 10 booths. I have to say there were a lot of them.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.960]   And I avoided it. I didn't want to cover it. I didn't want to like, I didn't even know how.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:38.920]   I personally didn't have any interest in it, but that's just me. I went to a suite that had a
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.400]   bunch of products and I came away with it. Did you wear your collar? I was wearing my collar.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Oh, God. That's so good. I came away with a gift bag and I didn't open it up until I got back
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.320]   to my house and there were two of them in there. I'm like, oh, right. How am I going to explain
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.000]   that when I get back to the Vatican? It's kind of embarrassing. And I don't want to,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.960]   I don't want to be sexist about it. It is ridiculous that women's health and women's pleasure was
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.480]   somehow second class to men's pleasure. So I'm glad that they did the right thing,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.240]   but at the same time, do you have any computers? Is there anything else I can look at?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.320]   I will only say two things. One, a well designed product actually is amazing because it's not
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.560]   just a product. You have to design it for comfort. You have to design it with proper materials.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.160]   The second thing is they're Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and in many cases that I do not like because
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.520]   again, this is not just for health technology. This is for any technology when security gets
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.480]   slapped on as an afterthought, you are just asking for trouble. But they don't know that in their
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.920]   R&D just exactly. They're not even considering tech. But you've got these internet enabled
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.280]   applications and I'm like, do you really want that? Yeah. I mean, unless you've actually considered
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   how that can be abused, that should not be a feature. Yeah. Well said. Anyway,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.800]   so good. So if you want coverage, don't come to Twitter for that. You've got to see that. They had
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.320]   a whole section, a whole bunch of health people covering it. Apple was there for the first time
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.160]   in a long time and an official capacity. Apple always sends people. But Jane Horvath,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.880]   whose Apple's privacy officer actually did a keynote spoke in a panel
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:29.000]   talking about the state of consumer privacy, speaking of privacy. First time in 28 years
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:40.520]   that Apple was at CES in a official capacity and made headlines because she talked about
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.480]   encryption, the encryption issue. She says, because remember, Apple was famously asked by the FBI
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   to decrypt the phone, the cell phone, the iPhone of the Apple of the San Bernardino mass murder
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:01.960]   shooter in 2015. They refused the FBI back down. Horvath said, building back doors into
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.480]   encryption is not the way we're going to solve these issues. She talked about privacy by design.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:18.520]   But she also revealed that Apple does do some surveillance that they do, for instance,
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   look for child pornography on their device and on their cloud, that they are somehow, she wasn't
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:33.320]   specific about this, filtering through your pictures. Is that privacy? And then you have to
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   question, can we balance protecting miners online with protecting people's privacy?
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.560]   That's the hard part on this because it's their servers, this Apple servers, right,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.840]   when they scan in your photos through the iCloud services. It's theirs. They have the right to
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:58.280]   manage it, how they see fit. And kudos to them for having some type of cognizance of trying to be
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.360]   aware of the issues of child pornography and whatnot. But then at the same time, did we sign up for
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.080]   them to quote unquote snoop on that? Well, an apparently responsibility to right once it's on
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:19.000]   their servers and they own sort of the part of the data, it's your data, but they're hosting it,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.720]   so they have some responsibility too. So I think that's where there's a lot of gray area here
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:31.000]   that still has a society. A lot of those conversations stuff to happen. What are our expectations
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.720]   as a society? Honestly, I think that Apple mishandled it, or mishandled it by not saying
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.200]   what they're doing, because there are ways to do this that are non-umtricive in their ways to do
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.280]   it, that are obtrusive Facebook, Twitter and Google use something called photo DNA, which is
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.120]   merely looking at the hashes of known child pornography online and looking for the same image
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.800]   on their service. So they're not looking at your images in any real sense, they're just scanning
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.520]   for hashes that mash your hashes of known bad images. If Apple said that's what we're doing,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.880]   no worries, no problem, but they didn't say that. But Facebook also employs an army of people,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.200]   humans, who humans, actual humans who have to physically look at the digital imagery and video
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.680]   coming true. Just to find that hash to begin with. And you have to remember, when we talk about
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.040]   asking these companies to self-police or to be proactive, because we just did a huge hearing
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:31.240]   in DC asking these companies to be proactive in their stand against the undesirable elements
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:37.080]   of the internet. This is what we're asking them to do. It's so hard to do. So this is-
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.800]   Slippery slope too.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.920]   And this is the problem we have across the board, which is, and it's always
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.200]   things like, oh, think of the children. They always use these very loaded issues to say,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   well, it's okay to scan for child pornography. But what Apple was unclear about, are they
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.880]   looking at images? Are they using humans? Are they using hashes? They didn't say what they're doing.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.160]   And is it just limited to child pornography? They're looking for other illegal activity.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.360]   What exactly are they doing?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.680]   Or is it an issue of Ms. Horvath wasn't coached on what to say?
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.400]   And I would expect at some point to hear more detail.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:23.240]   So she raised a little bit of controversy by talking about that. But it's just not clear
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.520]   what Apple's doing. Nevertheless, it's good to have Apple at least talking about this
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.000]   in a panel fashion.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.480]   Did you-
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.800]   These are going to be one of the most important topics for a studio with,
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.960]   as a society, over the next decade. Because a lot of the companies,
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   it's been the Wild West for a lot of these tech companies. And they have more and more power
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.200]   over the conversation.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.360]   And more and more responsibility, right?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:58.280]   Exactly. And so what our expectations are for them, what the regulations or guardrails are
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.240]   for them and doing some of these things, especially when it comes to managing your data and looking
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   through your stuff, right? Because that gets back to, at least in the US, some constitutional
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.920]   issues potentially. So there's a lot that we still have to figure out.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.560]   We've barely scratched the surface on it. And you can expect that it to be a big part of
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:27.880]   the 2020 political campaign in the US, as well as conversations that are going to happen worldwide
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:35.560]   over the next decade. It started to happen a little bit in Europe more than other places.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.280]   It's very- A lot of these issues are similar to the US, but obviously it's more population
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:47.560]   dense there. And government takes a more active hand, obviously, in society, typically, in most of
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.520]   the countries.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.200]   I mean, this wasn't a CES story, but we learned the Guardian reported that Microsoft was using
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.400]   workers working at home in China to listen to Skype audio to grade it to improve it with no
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.880]   security measures at all. So- There's a lot of this happening in Amazon and Facebook.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.200]   Yeah, remember Siri and Echo and Google Assistant all had the same problem? Now,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.920]   we're finding out Microsoft was doing this. We understand that a lot of these services need to
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.200]   have some humans comparing what the system heard with what the person actually said.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.800]   But I think in response to these revelations, Google, Amazon, and Apple both have said,
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.320]   "Okay, you can opt out of that. You don't have to do that, and we're going to have better controls.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.400]   Now Microsoft caught in that same problem."
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.800]   If we want these systems to be better, we have to allow these big companies to train the systems.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.000]   But they also have an obligation to tell you they're doing it and to give you the option to
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.160]   opt out. That's part of the California privacy law that goes into effect.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.680]   We're running into this idea that we think that there's going to be a technological
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.480]   solution to this. And unfortunately, that's not the case. That technology is already far outpaced
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:03.080]   what we're ready for. The problem is we have not developed a consistent morality about what
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.600]   we want them to actually do. And you can see how hard it is.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.280]   Because we can all say- We want both.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.360]   Should there be something to stop child pornography?
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.880]   Yes. Yes. Of course. Okay, well, if we're already looking for child pornography, what about drug
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.720]   activity? Well, worse, maybe. Should they be able to look at your hard drive?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.120]   Should they be looking at everybody's cloud accounts to see?
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.240]   Should they be able to look through all my pictures to see if any of them are child pornography?
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.320]   And what about false positives? I have pictures on my account of my kids in the bathtub.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.720]   The bright line examples are easy. It's all that gray area that none of us are going to agree on.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.560]   Right. Yeah. And think of it as like in the real world, right? In the real world, if you were like,
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:46.600]   okay, because this comes up with the Ring Doorbell examples, which they handled very badly,
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.320]   right? Where you have people have these Ring Doorbells, you have a camera on your doorbell.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.240]   And with that, they're working with the police and the police are pulling the information without
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.440]   people knowing it from doorbells when crimes happen. And you can say, great, that's, you know,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.120]   they're being proactive and they're catching people who are committing crimes.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.840]   But if you think of it, you know, when you turn it on its head and you think of it from a real
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.160]   or example, it's almost like saying, I have a house, I live in a community. If the police,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.840]   you know, are in charge of protecting this community, then they can come and they can hang out on my
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:29.000]   porch. They can go through my backyard because they're, you know, looking for information that's
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.320]   going to help keep the community safe. Well, no, it doesn't work that way. They have to have a,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.920]   you know, in order to come on private property, they have to have a permit.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.840]   They have to have courts and judges that say, yes, there is probable cause for them to come,
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:49.000]   you know, into your property and do that. So that's where the slippery slope starts to happen,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.040]   which, which, you know, which Robert was just talking about.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.480]   Well, and there's not even any agreement on how to handle it. You know, Ring was at CES,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:01.720]   remade a lot of announcements. They had an opportunity at that time to clear up their reputation
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   they did not about this. They not only did they not, but their company's top hardware exec said,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.880]   we're proud of the program of our partnerships with law enforcement. And we're going to do more
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:21.320]   of that. This was at CES. He, he said, he believes this is Dave Limp. The partnerships the police
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.040]   departments are good for neighborhoods and hinted at a future in which Ring cameras could use Amazon's
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:32.920]   facial recognition technology. By the way, my, my Google Nest doorbell already does.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:39.000]   It'll say, Michael's at the front door. You want to let him in? And I like that. And this is the
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.520]   problem. I think you might in your neighborhood say, I think it's a good idea that the police can
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:51.560]   look at these videos. So, you know, clearly Amazon has decided it's less, it's not a big,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:57.960]   as big a black mark as vice and others have painted it. Maybe, maybe in fact, normal Americans think
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:04.920]   this is a pretty good thing. There is no expectation of privacy in public. Period. You have to, you
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.840]   have to- And definitely not on my doorstep. Yeah. And actually, if you've got these products in
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.800]   your house, you now have no external expectation of privacy inside your house. If you've got an
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.000]   echo, if you've got cameras watching you inside the house, that's all going off to the internet.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.040]   And if my policy is, if it touches a network, I have no reasonable expectation of privacy for
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.320]   that data. Yeah. Okay. And that's fair. That's super annoying. And by the way, I think that Ring
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:36.120]   got a little bit of a bad rap because it turns out you have to opt in to share your Ring video
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.280]   with the neighbor program and that the police have to request the video from you and you have
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.240]   to say, okay, if you want that video, share with the police. So it's not like, you know,
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.160]   we're all putting up police cameras up and down our street. Willy-nilly. And there are a lot of
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:59.560]   people would say, so let's do that because, I mean, except those programs get misuse all the time.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.000]   And misuse. And there's a great example of that, which is geolocating of cell phones. That was
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.200]   only supposed to be available to law enforcement agencies. And it turned out anybody who could set
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:17.000]   up an account could could represent themselves as a bounty hunter and therefore be illegally
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.560]   able to obtain records for any phone for like 55 cents each. And I see people on Twitter this
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:31.720]   week saying, oh, I got my email from Google Maps that shows my entire year of locations
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.520]   and all the places I've been. Isn't this cool? And I turned that off.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.960]   So one of the things too that, you know, Alfred Ng from CNET for, from, you know, our publication
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:50.680]   has been reporting pretty adamantly on some ways that Ring has not been forthcoming about the way
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.600]   that they're using it. And it's not just the ways that you thought, like you said, Leo,
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.400]   if it was just the way of I said, okay, I'm connecting my camera to the police network and I'm giving
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:06.520]   the permission to use it. Then, you know, that is much more clear and transparent. You could be
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:13.640]   fine with that. What's happened is to what Father Robert was talking about is the ways that they're
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:19.240]   using it that we don't expect that that's where the problem comes in, right? And it's very tempting
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.960]   for them to have this ability. And what we've seen is Amazon has in some ways been
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.320]   not so forthcoming about some of the data that they are sharing with police, even when it's not
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   just those straight sort of opt-ins. And that's where this gets standard.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.680]   Here's the good news, at least in California now, thanks to the California Privacy Act,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.160]   companies who want to do business in California have to reveal what information they gather.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.640]   They have to give you the right to delete it. I think that's going to help. It's kind of our own
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.200]   GDPR and because California is a big part of the US economy, I think those companies are just
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.760]   going to say, "Well, we'll make it for all customers in the US." I hope Ring will pay attention to that.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.160]   It's dumb of Amazon because people are already very nervous about Amazon and what Amazon is
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.360]   gathering. And Amazon, I mean, that's their business. We thought they were in the retail business.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.280]   We thought they were selling books. They're in the data business. They're gathering data.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.440]   That's what they do. And that's what they do so well.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.280]   What, and they throw in stones at PayPal's acquisition here recently, Amazon?
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.960]   Probably were. Yeah. They're in the transaction business. They want to be in the middle of every
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:35.160]   transaction on Earth making pennies off of every transaction digital and physical, right?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.760]   Physical packages, but also delivery of data, whether that's images going from your doorbell
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:49.000]   to the police or to the cloud or whether it's you buying music digitally or storing your
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.960]   information or your company on their servers or them delivering packages to you, right?
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.480]   They're in the information of delivering bits and atoms and making a profit off of every one of them.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.040]   Let's take a little break. There's so much more. We haven't even really gotten into CES.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.680]   Father Roberts got a lot of stuff I brought something back. We
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:15.880]   and has some stuff. We're going to talk more about CES, Jason Heiner from...
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.640]   Now, can I still say Tech Republic or just editorial director CBS Interactive? Is that really what it?
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.600]   So, so yeah, so I'm not at Tech Republic anymore.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.560]   You're not. Okay.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.080]   Build that Wilder is the editor in chief.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.600]   I guess we had this conversation. You are editorial director for CNET.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.360]   That's right. That's the title, which is CBS Interactive.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.160]   That's right. Still at CBS Interactive, just running a different site.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.560]   Yeah, different brand. Yeah. And we saw a lot of people from us from...
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.800]   You had how many 90 people? Oh my gosh.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.560]   Kept running into his former colleagues.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.320]   It was so awesome. Like, he was in the lobby and it was great.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.040]   It was fun. He walked up and greeted me and hugged me.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.280]   They remember you. Oh my gosh.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.560]   You're that guy who wears orange.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.000]   One of the best hires I ever made, Ant Prove it.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.920]   Oh, thanks, sir. Me too.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.640]   Yes, I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm very, very glad he's working for you.

[00:31:51.480 --> 00:32:04.520]   Actually, I was this week... I was really interested to re-wit Bill Thompson said it on
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:11.560]   Stratecary. His name's not Bill. Why is he? Bill. Bill. Ben Thompson. I know Ben pretty well,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:17.240]   but I was this Bill. On Stratecary, his lead this week was the end of the beginning.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.800]   And this is something I've said for a while. We're talking about Google, Amazon, Apple,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.280]   Microsoft, Facebook. I think some people say, "Oh, they'll be another Facebook. They'll be another
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.360]   Google. They'll be another Microsoft or Amazon. You know, IBM didn't last forever." He says,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.680]   "That's not necessarily true. And the car industry is kind of a way to look at this." He said,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:45.400]   "When automobiles were first invented, in 1895, the first American automobile maker
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:55.640]   was founded. 34 more in the next five years. 233 more in the next 10 years. 168 more in the next.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.880]   There were a lot of... And then slows down and pretty much boiled down for many decades to the
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:11.160]   big three. GM Ford and Chrysler. Until imports start showing up. Yeah. And you know, I think people
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.000]   might have said, "Oh, well, they'll be another Nash or something. GM isn't going to own this forever."
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.680]   No, there's an economy of scale. There's things Google does now that you couldn't start up and do.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.880]   There's things Facebook does. There's the network effect. He says, "We're in a dominance epic. We're
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.880]   in the third dominance epic. It was first IBM, then Microsoft, and then present day. And you can no
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.960]   longer assume that that's going to change, that these companies." He says, "But that's the beginning
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:49.240]   of an era like with cars where you get amazing innovation because you've got these big platform
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.680]   companies that everybody can innovate on. And I... Here I am walking around CES. And what do you see?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.760]   You see thousands of little companies, but sign after sign works with Amazon Echo,
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:07.160]   works with Google Assistant, works... Some type of hook-in. Yeah. They're building on a platform.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.920]   And even though there wasn't a Google presence, I didn't... Did you go down the slides?
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:19.560]   You wrote the slides, Father Robert? Really? I didn't get to. And I didn't get to. What was it like?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.720]   So that Google had in the front a gumball machine. I avoided that thing like to play.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.960]   Did you get in the gumball line? I did. There was a sign at one point in the line that said,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   "This line is three hours to the gumball machine from this point in the line." Oh, no.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.520]   I never saw less than two hours in that line. I knew someone at the... Oh, you jumped the line?
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.720]   That's why I'm not talking about it too much. I kind of cheated. So it's a giant machine. You
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:50.200]   do a Google crayon to a microphone. A giant big gumball comes down. It's not a gumball. You open it up
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:57.960]   inside a beanie inside a butt bag inside. I saw somebody win a phone. What did you win?
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.800]   I actually got a Chromebook. Oh, shut up. You can't keep it. I can't keep it.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.720]   But so they were giving away some nice stuff. I guess that's why the line was so long.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.120]   But, crime and netly. I'm not waiting three hours even for a Chromebook.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.720]   I didn't have any appointments. It looked kind of fun. I wanted to try.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.280]   Then what was the slot? A yellow media tag on to netelp. What was the slides?
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.120]   Because that was... So the parking lot has these giant Google buildings in it.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:30.920]   I remember one year, many years ago, Microsoft had a house like the Wizard of Oz landed in the
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:37.480]   parking lot inside where mom and dad, cis and brother using Microsoft tablets. This was
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:43.400]   pre-surface. This was back when Bill Gates was all over the tablet. What was the Google house?
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   What was going on in there? Honestly, that was too crowded. I didn't want to go. I was so
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.240]   crowded verse this time. This is what I didn't even go to LVCC the first day. I stayed at the
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.040]   sales. That was pretty smart. LVCC the first day was pretty bad. Bananas.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   You noticed, by the way, that Las Vegas is expanding that. It looks like more than doubling it.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.080]   I think that their ideas should all be in one building.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   There's no way it can fit.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.200]   LVCC, it's Caesars. It's Wind. It's Venetian. It's Palazzo.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.760]   It's all on your hands. You can't get anywhere.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.560]   So you just stay at the sands because I can't get a shuttle.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.680]   The shuttle that goes from Venetian to LVCC takes 30 minutes. That should be my business.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.280]   You can walk it. You can walk it. It's faster to walk.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:39.000]   And you get some fresh air for the only time you get to actually see the sun when you're in Vegas.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.120]   You totally lose track of time because you're indoors so much and you don't see the sun.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:49.560]   I believe when we went to the sands, I had no idea the time of day. It felt like lunchtime.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.920]   And it was closer to the end of the day. To me, it looks like a science fair.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:01.560]   So there was a guy who had, I saw a lot of CurryGov. There was the CurryGov olive oil.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.320]   We actually shot that one. Where you get little frozen olive oil pellets, you put it in there.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.680]   And they're going to mix it. It's really the Juicero of olive oil.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.720]   But I wasn't going to say anything. Nice Italian guy selling him in Italy.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:19.480]   Then I saw the CurryGov muffin ovens. It was a little oven that they had little
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:25.240]   cup muffin recipes you put in there. I don't even know why anybody would do that.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.280]   CurryGov mixed drinks. Mixed drinks? Yes. They had a lot of stuff was in
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   sands. Lots of your alcohol. That was in sands. They had the the CurryGov nitro brewed coffee,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:43.640]   which was interesting. It's a very different taste. Yeah. It's nitrogen extracted. So you take
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.480]   coffee beans, you put them under pressure with nitrogen and it acts as a solvent. We shot my
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:53.320]   favorite thing there, which I was really glad I went to the basement. I walked miles before I
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   found anything good. But I did find there was one guy in the back. We shot video of it.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   It was just a young kid. It was from Russia. He was living in New Jersey. He's made an Apple
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:10.440]   one kit for $99. He said, "Was approved it because we use his coat. We have an arduino for
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.520]   the disc controller and the screen." And I said, "Well, what's that?" He says,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.040]   "It's a 6502. I said, "Where'd you get a 6502?" Well, he said, "Well, there's some old ones from
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:25.320]   Mosfet, but there's a guy who makes them. There's a guy fabbing 6502s. He comes with a breadboard,
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.920]   all the chips. You don't have to solder. You put it together. The $99 bucks, you can have an
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.960]   Apple one. I says it at lower cases. No, of course not. It's an Apple one. It's all school.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.800]   It's all school. That's like 1876 technology. I thought that to see a kid, he was probably 25
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:46.200]   doing that. And the fact that was he contacted was and was said, "Yeah, I like that idea. Go
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.480]   ahead and do it." You know what I don't like? Steve was a better founder of Apple.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.800]   Oh, thank you. All right. Thank you. There are some people who don't know that.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.000]   They might think I'm talking about some sort of kangaroo or something.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.880]   One of the trends from the sands, from the innovation pavilions that I do not like,
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.680]   is their tendency to ghetto-wise. So it used to be by category, right? And now it's by country.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.560]   It's like Korea. So you go to France. Yeah, we walk through a line at a France side.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.480]   Yeah. I love Eureka Park. It's almost like a flea market.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.960]   It's like a flea market of technology. But you know, the cool thing is,
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:28.520]   CS is dominated by these giants, right? Samsung and LG and Sony. They have monster,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.840]   multi-million dollar booths. I agree. And then a bunch of these companies are just really scrappy,
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.800]   startup, sometimes just two people and their whole marketing budget they spent to buy a
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:45.080]   booth in Eureka Park and they're there. And I was just trying to peddle their wares,
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.520]   you know, and get somebody to believe in what they're doing. And there are people,
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.680]   like you said, from all over the world. And some of those are companies that are pretty big. If
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:57.320]   this was a show in Europe, they would have a bigger booth, but they're here, you know. So
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.040]   there's a little bit of everything. They're just people that are pretty passionate. Some of them
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.400]   aren't very polished about the way that they're giving their presentation. So you have to kind
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:13.960]   of read between the lines a little bit. I wish I could have honestly just stopped more booths there
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.440]   and give it more of them my attention. That's, but it was so hard to hear. You feel guilty,
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:24.200]   because you can't. You can't. There's so many people there. Thousands of products just in that
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.280]   one space alone. It wasn't really media friendly either from a video standpoint, because you could
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.840]   really hear in there and then the light in is. And there was an angle to get the products without
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.160]   getting everything in there. If you didn't stop us, if you dared to write about this
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:46.440]   crappy video and audio, didn't care, didn't care going in. I found when I was down there,
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:51.800]   I had to put my camera away between shoots, because if I carried it out, I was getting
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.000]   pulled to boot. I'm like, I got I got way late in Switzerland. I could barely.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.680]   Barely get through Switzerland. I expected better food in the France pavilion.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:11.320]   By the way, did you eat the press lunches? I did. Yeah, we had one because the place you
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.360]   eat the press lunch is at the Venetian, not at LVCC. No, there's one in LVCC as well. No, no,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:22.120]   in LVCC, it's horrible. Yeah, it's just a good one. It's just a fishbowl. Yeah, like what I was
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.040]   getting at the sands was like dim sum and sushi. Oh, man. Really? I didn't know that. Oh, man.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.000]   I think that was I don't think that was I don't think that was no, no, no, that was
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.800]   pressed. You just had to ask the right person. We're gonna we're gonna treat Leo and Antsex on
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:45.080]   CES adventure as just a beta. That was a beta next year. And it went pretty well, though. It was fun.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.800]   I you know, Twit, if you I think what it was a 38 segments we did. It was pretty close.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:58.040]   Twit. I guess you're still standing. That's awesome. Well, Twit.io/ces and would shoot one.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.520]   I would shoot one. We go back and forth. Lisa shot a few. We got Scott Wilkinson showed us the
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:11.640]   TVs. I have to say of all the things I saw, the one I wanted to bring home was the giant 8k micro
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.200]   LED. I think micro LED. Well, it's not available yet. And it's if you could afford it, actually,
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.360]   I guess you can, but it's just like million dollars. But I think in the years to come as they
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.960]   improve the product, it really actually they have to improve the process. In the content.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:31.320]   Yeah. Well, there's no content. They can't manufacture it right now, to be honest. It has a
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:38.520]   little bit of an uncertain future because it's too hard to make. It is. It's too hard to make.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.400]   They've not figured out how to manufacture it at scale. You'll you'll see them wiggle on that a
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:49.880]   little bit from what from our sources, from what we've learned that it's a little it's a little bit
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.280]   of a of a mystery if it's going to actually come to the mass market.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.880]   But we can learn I was in Korea in November and had some pretty good sources there. And also
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:08.680]   sort of this announcement that went under the radar is Samsung is going to be making OLED
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:18.840]   screens, which has a great future. And Samsung so LG owns the OLED market today for TVs.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.480]   Even if you buy a Sony OLED, you're getting an LG panel right from Sony. Yeah.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:30.840]   So LG dis sorry. So Samsung display, which makes which is a competitor to LG display,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:36.120]   which sells all those. They announced in the fall very quietly that they're announcing what
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:42.040]   they call QD display, which if you look at closely, it's actually OLED using quantum dot. So this is
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:48.200]   very wonky. But essentially they're they're taking the technology that they've learned to do with
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:57.800]   their QLED displays and bring sort of this mashup of OLED and with QLED, which is just a film on top
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:04.360]   of the screen. I was in short term is probably the future. I did that time. I agree with you.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.800]   100%. Yeah. But remember how long it took OLED to get to maturity? There are all sorts of problems
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.040]   with OLED. Maybe it'll be 10 years. Micro LED, I think we'll get there eventually. But yeah,
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.440]   it's not next year. It's not the year after. It's a few years off. I had to think it was interesting
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.880]   to see that Samsung's QLED technology, which I thought they owned showing up with high sense
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   and other companies. Apparently other companies are able to make QLEDs as well. I don't know if
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.920]   that Samsung licensing it. High sense has some great displays. There's some beautiful men.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:39.560]   It's just a film. They don't own the they don't own the like the the the the name QLED. Others
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:46.040]   can can use that. And so but Samsung's technology is you know a little bit further ahead. They
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.880]   talked about some things that they've done. I did see the one it didn't get much press, but I thought
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:59.320]   it's the nicest TV you could buy today is the Samsung 8K. It's a they're called their infinity
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.920]   display. Yeah, that was gorgeous. It's an 8K display that is literally bezel-less.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:10.760]   I saw like a soccer match on it. And literally when the ball gets kicked, you know, on our TVs
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:17.560]   today, we don't think about it. But the there's like a blur goes by. You don't see any blur as the
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:24.120]   ball moves in this 8K. And as the runners are running, you know, you see every pixel of them
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   running. I thought, Oh my gosh, to watch a sporty. That's it. That's an LCD TV. But see,
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.880]   that's that's why I write aces had. Well, it is. It's a QLED QL.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:42.200]   Aces had their 360 series of monitors that refreshed at 360 times a second. 360.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.560]   That's another thing we saw for gamers. Yeah, it's gonna be really interesting. It wasn't just
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:53.320]   Asus. We also saw LG had one variable refresh rate. So if it uses G sync, right, the Nvidia
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:59.240]   card can say, okay, faster, slower, faster. That's wild. It's and that 300 Hertz. I honestly,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.880]   I thought it was all PR speak. I thought it was all marketing. I'm not gonna be able to see anything
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:09.640]   above 120. But they put a 240 next to a 360. And you can see the difference. You can see it.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:16.200]   Yeah, you totally can see it. But when especially when things move fast, so action movie sports,
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.480]   things that move back, if you're just watching, you know, you know, a beautiful mountain or,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.960]   you know, some flowers or something like that, you're not going to see it. But when you see motion,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:33.800]   then all of a sudden, and you see, you know, big explosions or other kind of action things,
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:40.760]   is that you really see this. And like you're saying, you know, gaming is one of those areas
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.280]   where you're going to see it a lot too. I'll tell you how long it's been since I've been at CES.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:49.000]   The last time I was there, there was this running battle between companies who had the biggest
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.200]   display and remember that? I thought you were going to say, oh, they had the Walkman and the
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.680]   Walkman. It wasn't that long ago. But it was like, Oh, Samsung has a 100 inch old sharp has a 101
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.360]   inch 102. Nobody attempted to compete with Samsung's the wall. I think that thing is
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:14.040]   two stories 45 inch, 292, 92 stories. Was that a micro led or what was that?
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.840]   That's micro led. Yeah, because you can because those are a foot by roughly a foot square and you
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:24.040]   could tile them. One thing I did notice though on the micro leds in the right lighting conditions,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.280]   you can see the edges of the scenes. So they got to work on that too.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.840]   Yeah, the crazy thing is what's even weird about this when we went and when we saw it in Korea,
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:42.760]   we went to the area where they kind of staged these things and they had box after box after box
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:50.680]   in this giant long hallway stacked like 10 or 15 deep. Meaning these are the ones they're shipping
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:57.560]   out to places and having them installed. Obviously, it's only like the one, not even the 1% but the
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.400]   point 1% that are getting these things because it's a million bucks at least.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're at least 300 to 500,000 to just start on these things. So if you are,
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:19.320]   professional athletes, obviously, Wall Street bankers, podcast, broadcast.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.680]   Yeah, I know. Right. Right.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:28.840]   No, I told Lisa when we saw that one of the big 8k micro leds, it's not going to be for five,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:36.120]   10 years, but someday we will have a room with a wall that is a giant micro led TV because you
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.760]   piece these together and they're arbitrarily large. Well, that's coming. It's going to happen.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.440]   I know they have problems now, Jason, but that's going to happen eventually.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.000]   You talk about it. I just wonder if it'll be OLED because what I think this is my own opinion.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.520]   But I think that as we get more and more further along with these things, I think we're going to
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:00.200]   ask ourselves, why do we want to hang this giant black mirror on our walls? And I think we're
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:05.640]   going to be like, that's so strange to hang that up. And when it's not on, what is it?
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:12.360]   It's just why would it not be on all the time? Well, that's where, yeah, it's so you are starting
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.680]   with you on that. I'm leaving it on. The hell with a black mirror. I'm leaving it on.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.640]   So, you know, there are these ambient modes. So when it's not. Yeah, when it's when it's,
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.360]   yes, exactly. I'll be in a Japanese family or what's our nerd? Green savor.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:32.120]   Yeah. Lions will be running roaming the velt. I live in a six by seven room with so it'll be
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:37.080]   cheaper for you. It would be awesome. Yeah. So I will have a guard. I will actually have a view
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:43.480]   of something exactly. There you go. Exactly. Turn it into a turn it into a window,
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:49.400]   a gigantic window. You're seeing that some ambient modes that are. Oh, yeah, I love that.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.600]   I'm going to have that. There were also picture frames with beautiful paintings in them. Maybe
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.640]   you'll have a van go on your wall. Did you always want to do the Harry Potter thing with them?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:05.080]   Yeah, yeah. There you go. My whole life. Why not? So Samsung did show off some of those because
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.240]   they're current technology QLED. You can leave it on all the time and it doesn't have the burn-in
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.160]   problems. That's the one problem with OLED right now and probably some of these other
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.640]   newer technologies as well as the burn-in on your screen. But there were some
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:23.560]   these ambient mode screen, essentially like screen savers like you said, that are running.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:29.480]   So one was like a window and you had some books on it and the wind would blow and it would like,
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.840]   you know, the pages would flip. I love that. So it was just sitting there or another one was a
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:40.280]   fireplace and the fire's crackling, you know, straight out of Blade Runner. I love it. Are we
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.520]   heading to Max Hadram territory? It's going to be a little bit turned off your TV. Yes,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:49.160]   that should be illegal. I should be illegal now. I could see this right here in the last past
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.080]   studios on that. If you want to watch every Netflix show, you're going to have to leave it
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.480]   on all day and all night naturally. Yeah. Well, you're going to have one wall for Netflix,
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:03.080]   one wall for you two. Oh, yes. And then the floor is reserved for Vimeo. Oh, yes.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.880]   We come from the future. Get ready, folks. Actually, one thing that we saw a lot of is
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:14.440]   the fact that these OLED screens can bend. So we saw a lot of curvy stuff. We saw a lot of folding
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:20.280]   phones. Is it? Yeah. Roy out. Roy old had like a cylinder with a screen around it,
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.440]   all sorts of things. It was a smart speaker. Ish. Yeah. They were the first to do the
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.240]   folding phone last year at CES than everybody copied. Although John Gruber writing in Dairy
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.360]   Fireball talked a little bit about the fact that CES should be called the concept
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.840]   electronic show because a lot of these folding phones will never be sold. I would prefer that,
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.320]   actually. I don't call it concept because it'll be sold everywhere else but the US.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.600]   That's what I liked about CES of the past. Well, you would see stuff that you knew wasn't going
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:55.080]   to see the light of day outside of a lab. Yeah, I love that Sony's car. Sony got a lot of attention
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.000]   because at the end of their keynote, they said, "Oh, and we have a car." And I was like, "What?"
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.640]   They didn't expect that but it's not a car you'll ever be able to buy or they'll ever manufacture.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:10.920]   It was just a concept. Yeah. Well, the show was originally a place where product buyers from big
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.640]   retailers would go and they'd pick like, "Okay, I want a bunch of those." Make that for me. I'll buy
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.440]   a thousand of those. Yeah. Exactly. And they would put their orders in and then it evolved into a
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.160]   little bit more of a concepty kind of show. I think what we've seen now is there's room for both,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:30.680]   right? There's room for companies to come, announce. These are the products we have coming out in 2020.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.480]   And here's some ideas we have about the future. Take a look at these. Let us know what you think
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.280]   because that's the way they use it. And then they just, they may never go into product development
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.200]   or they may be in various stages of product development and they get the reaction from
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.120]   consumers, from the press, and then they decide, "Okay, this is if we're going to go forward or not
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.960]   or how we're going to go forward or how we're going to change the product and move ahead with it."
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:00.840]   I like the idea of concepts. It's just given us a starting point or something we can have.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.200]   Cooper points out. He's wrong. Apple has concepts. They don't show them. They make them. They demo
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.760]   them. Their design lab makes them. They don't show anything till they can sell it. Project
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.680]   Perp- Well, the PowerMat was a mistake. Okay, you're right.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.280]   So maybe they are changing. But there is something to be said for a company that, I mean, every
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.680]   company is going to do concepts. That's part of the design process. Showing them off shows,
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.840]   I think in my mind, shows a little weakness. It's almost saying, "See, we can innovate. We can
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.680]   develop cool stuff. But if you're not going to make it, if you can't make it, then turn it into a
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.160]   product." If Sony cannot make that car, will not make that car. There's no point.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:41.800]   But Sony can partner. No, no. That's not the point of that car. The point of that car was to get
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:47.000]   attention. The point of the car was exactly the same point as the Sharman toilet paper robot.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:55.080]   Robot. This robot. So this is the thing that always gets me about CES. Actually,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.360]   let me take a break and then I'll tell you the thing that always gives me about CES.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.040]   And then Father Robert brought a bunch of stuff. So we got to do a little show and tell.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:09.480]   A little show and tell. Robert Baoesser, the digital Jesuit, is here on Lee from the Vatican.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.760]   Where do you go back? Wednesday morning. And hopefully my plane will make it all the way across.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.680]   Yeah, I was watching your Twitter. You were flying out of Tally on a triple seven.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:24.040]   It had to turn back as an engine went out. They decided to add this engine's tired. So we're
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   going to turn around and see if you can get more than one engine. I guess. Oh my gosh. Thank goodness
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.480]   it was a triple seven. Triple sevens can fly one engine. No problem. Were you over the ocean?
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.920]   Just about. We were just about feet wet. And then you started hearing the engine spool down and
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.120]   the potty comes. We're having a technical difficulty. So we're going to head back to
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:45.160]   Rome. So it can fly on the one. It can fly in the one but not a customer. No spare. Right.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.720]   Nope. The other one is a good one. Good job. It's a
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:56.360]   Pruitt is here host of Hands Off Photography. Focus on photography. Love having aunt. He was my
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.480]   partner, my partner in crime and aunt and Leo's excellency as adventure, which was excellent.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.680]   It was a great time. I loved it. It was a lot of hard work laying me for the bad camera and
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:13.000]   sound. I was very amateurish, but we saw some good stuff from Panasonic. The Lumix camera and
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.960]   the new Panasonic. I think next year we can take one of those out and try it with that. Also Jason
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:24.600]   Heiner of course, because he's editorial director at CNET, their coverage was stellar, superb.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.360]   Did you guys have you normally you have a studio in the south hall. You didn't do that this year.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:35.720]   No, it was in it was in the fans. Yeah. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Bigger.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:42.120]   Bigger. It was very nice. It's so we moved last year. We used to always do the south hall.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:48.920]   Last year we moved to Sands because a lot of the newer stuff is in tech West, right? Health and
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:55.160]   wellness, smart home. I mentioned Eureka Park where a lot of the fun startups and stuff are is right
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:01.400]   one floor below. So we moved over there because a lot of the really fun interesting newer kind of
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:07.480]   stuff is over there. And so yeah, we have our stage right outside tech West.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.680]   We're going in the opposite direction. We used to have a stage in the south hall.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:18.360]   Now we have me a camera and an ant. I mean, you guys did a zillion videos. So
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:24.200]   shows you can do it that way. I wanted to see how light we could go. Maybe we went a little too
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:31.480]   light, but I want to see how little we could bring with us. And it was kind of it was kind of fun.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.640]   So I did it when we were tech republic. We'd go with four people, you know, a camera person
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.920]   and three of us. And then sometimes our freelancers like ant, right? We had ant come a couple of
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.880]   years. Mr. Derek would hunt me down and say, Hey, we need to do a segment.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.920]   You guys had the advantage. You had a beat. We didn't we don't have a beat. So we had to
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.800]   try to cover everything with one camera. It was exhausting.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   I showed it. We're going to talk about my, but what was it I was going to talk about? My favorite,
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.640]   my least favorite. I can't even remember. It was it was the robot. Oh, the charm and
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.040]   save it, save it. One of the world's biggest problems. I like
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.560]   explain why this is this in a nutshell is what's wrong with CES. But first,
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:17.560]   word from our sponsor. This is what's right with Epson. Epson makes printers, right? And they
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:23.160]   make jet printers. And for a long time, make cartridge printers, they had the courage to say,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   you know, maybe there's a better way to make an inkjet printer. Maybe instead of cartridges that
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.960]   run out in the middle of the print job every few weeks, we could put a big tank on our printer,
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:42.680]   four tanks, black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. You fill them up print thousands of pages before you
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:48.200]   need to put more ink in. Maybe we could do that. But then they realized, well, this is going to take
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   a smart consumer because the consumer is going to look at the box and say, what,
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.160]   you've got two years of ink in the box, it's going to cost a little bit more, right? They have to
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.200]   make that they have to understand that's going to save you money in the long run. It's going to
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:06.920]   save you frustration. You get all the beautiful color of an inkjet, but you also get up to two
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.080]   years of ink in the box. I even bought an extra set of ink bottles because I thought, well, you
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:16.600]   know, you have to always have more. Oh, it's been more than a year. Go ahead, print all the documents,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.320]   everything you need and beautiful color. Don't worry about it. You're not going to run out of ink
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:27.640]   because of those great eps and eco tank printers, color coded bottles. You can't load them wrong.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:32.200]   They can't spill them. They're easy. There's a whole range of them. Perfect for every need.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.520]   Add the eps and eco tank printer. You're a shopping list and you can do like Shaq does just fill
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:41.960]   and she'll transform the way your home or office prints. Do away without a
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:51.320]   vink frustration. Go to epsin.com/ecotankleo. E-P-S-O-N.com/ecotankleo for epsin's eco tank printers. I think
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.920]   they deserve a lot of credit for considering their customers first and doing something that was a
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:02.840]   little scary. Took a little courage at first, but man, is that make a difference. epsin.com/ecotankleo
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:08.920]   does fill and she'll epsin. Seed your vision. I've been using epsin with my computers since the
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:15.000]   very first computer I got. I thought matrix epsin MX80. Remember that? I missed the old dot
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:24.280]   matrix. You can pick one up. Tractor feed. Burst and decolate. Or you can get the 21st
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.440]   century printer. epsin.com/ecotankleo. Thank you epsin for supporting that.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.320]   So can I give a shout out real quick before we start it? Please. Can I give a shout out to
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:40.920]   Father Robert on the, I just noticed the inside joke on his laptop, not inside joke, but
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:47.160]   inside reference to one of the best Star Trek episodes there is. What does that say? Boy,
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:54.040]   you have good eyes because I can't read it. It's an episode, "Darmok and Jalad," which is about
[00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:02.120]   storytelling. It's about diplomacy. It's amazing. If you watch no other episode of Star Trek, if
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:08.120]   you're not a Star Trek fan, watch that one. If you are a Star Trek fan, look it up. It's
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:12.200]   one of the best. It's incredible. It's a great, a great episode. It is incredible.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:18.360]   You guys are such nerds. Nerd. Nerd now. All right. Sorry. Nerd out. Nerd.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   City. I could stare at that sticker all day. I wouldn't even have gotten it. No clue.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.880]   And I consider myself a Star Trek fan. No clue. Notice all of my secrets. Who is that? That's Picard.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.280]   That's Picard doing his doing his face. Are you excited about the new Picard?
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:38.280]   Please let it be good. Please. It has to be good. It looks good. The previews look good.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.480]   Do you like what I did with the Twitch sticker?
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:48.360]   That's nice. Well played, sir. So you have to, this is my problem, and no disrespect to
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:54.040]   CBS Interactive, but I don't want to buy CBS All Access. I didn't do it for Discovery. I don't know
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.640]   where I feel like they're, they're twisting my arms. If you want to see Picard, you have to
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.440]   subscribe. But everybody in the room has the CBS shows. Oh, well, I'll just just express
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.560]   the videos. I'll surf it. I'll surf it only. Thank you. I'll say the, thank you. Yeah. Outside
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:16.600]   of the US, CBS has a deal with Netflix and when, you know, most of the shows are, are
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   internationally streamed on Netflix. So again, full disclosure, CNET is wholly owned by
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.760]   the FBI by a comp, CBS. Are they going to release all the episodes at once or do I,
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.680]   is it a week by week? It'll be week by week. Okay. So I'll wait till they're all out for the
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.320]   first season. You're like me, just sort of waiting. I'd rather binge too. And I can't, I have no patience.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:42.280]   I don't, it's funny. It's just the opposite for me. I like, I like seeing it for a week and I'm
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.360]   digesting it and thinking about it and processing it and then seeing the next one.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.880]   Whereas if I, when I binge it, I just like, okay, that was good. Now what happens next? Now what happens next?
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.080]   Now what happens next? I don't really digest. I watch like two or three at a time and then I'll
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.240]   wait for a little while. Is there any analogy to the way you guys eat pizza? Like Jason, do you take,
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.800]   buy a whole pie, eat a slice to put it in the fridge for tomorrow? What? Slow food. It's like a slow food.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.560]   And you eat three pieces, putting the rest from the fridge and Robert and I, which is,
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.400]   there is no rest. There is no slices from a pizza. What is wrong?
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.240]   Right. What are they telling you about?
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.440]   There's nothing like cold pizza for breakfast. That is, I am not on that. The Cineco on that.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.200]   No, no, I'll have cold pizza, but it's normally the kids code pizza, not mine.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.360]   So that's pizza. Pizza in Italy is very different. I do like it, but it's not American.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.040]   No, you have to eat the whole thing in Italy. They don't even, they don't even slice it.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.240]   No preservatives. Take the whole pie. Pizza, pizza di San Monet. That's my jam.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:52.280]   CES is interesting because a lot of mainstream press coverage. And over the years, certain ecosystems
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:03:00.120]   have evolved to make it easier for channel seven, eight, nine, and ten, CNN and the others to get in,
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:07.080]   get out, get the story and get out. And so it started with, I think, showstoppers and then
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.680]   pepcoms digital experience. These are the little mini trade shows that they do before. And then
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.760]   the Consumer Electronics Association said, wait a minute, those guys are making a lot of money.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.320]   So they said, we're going to start ours on Sunday. Now the CES doesn't begin on Tuesday.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:27.960]   But you got to go to the, the unveiled, unveiled on Sunday, which used to be a train wreck.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:34.040]   They would go down. I never went to now. They would take an event the size of a pepcon or a
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.800]   showstoppers and they would put it into a room about one for. Oh, no.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:44.200]   Nothing. So which has the best food? Because that's the only reason journalists go showstoppers
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200]   are pepcom. I think showstoppers this year. Like not even close. Pretty good. Just pretty good.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:54.360]   So that's how. So this is the whole trick. So you rent a ballroom, you charge a hundred vendors,
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.280]   ten thousand dollars apiece minimum, you do the math minimum. You can charge some vendors more
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.160]   because I've realized now, and they did it with a happy fork that some vendors say, you know,
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:10.120]   if I'm the first person as you come in the door, I'm going to get all the coverage.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:17.320]   So this year, Sharman, you go in the door. There is Sharman. Frightens. Yeah. And Sharman didn't even
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:25.080]   bother. Didn't even pretend to make a device that you could buy. They made the robot. And I
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.600]   went up and I asked the kid who I said, did you invent this? He said, yeah. So when can I get it?
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.320]   He said, you never going to get it. What's the premise? It has the Sharman bear on the front.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.800]   It has a toilet paper roll on it. If you are sitting on the can and you run a toilet paper,
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.480]   the bot brings you to first of all, one of the world's biggest problems.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:47.080]   Yeah. It's just nuts. And there's no toilet tissue. But they're in an emergency. What do you do?
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.960]   What are you going to do? IOP, Internet of Pussy.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:55.240]   But they knew they did that. And they were the first thing in the front door in the very first
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.640]   trade show on Monday nights. CNN would go in, cover it and leave. All the press.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.280]   We've been at CES. Here's the greatest story, the robot. And it's a free ad for Sharman. They
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.880]   had a gold toilet. So I said, what's that do? Nothing. Nothing. Just a gold toilet seat.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:14.840]   Just sit on and get the roll. It's a it's a freaking head. So that's people are gaming it now.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.320]   Yes. You know, they didn't. The interesting is they did not think it was going to be as
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:25.080]   big as it was. Oh, they did. I asked them to pay extra for the close to the front door. He said,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.880]   I'm no comment. Yeah, which is. Yeah. Well, I think they did. But they still didn't think
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.840]   people were going to people were into it. Like people were really so they were saying that now
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:40.600]   they may actually may actually come to market. No, weird thing is, most people didn't really
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:46.440]   think this is going to open the door. Exactly. Where are you going to be sitting on the John?
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:52.760]   You're going to hear bang bang bang is a robot tries to get into the bathroom.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.720]   So yeah, where are you going to put it that is going to come and go? Is it going to have like
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.240]   one of those? How's it going to get more toilet paper on it? Right. Yeah. And how's it going to
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.000]   reload? I mean, well, you have another bot that loads the toilet paper on the bottom. So
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.960]   there you go. Well, that's Sharman R and D.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.920]   Well, I'm telling you, it was such a success, right? It's all you saw every main every
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.960]   main every main media coverage. You're going to see this every year from now on. Some major brand is
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.840]   going to have some stupid gadget that they know that will get all the coverage. Well, no, next
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:33.080]   year, Sharman is going to DRM the bot. So it only works with Sharman. So you can't use it.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:41.160]   It's the internet of poop. It's. Wow. Show that is correct. You can put any you could put, you know,
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.080]   Kroger brand on there and nobody would know the difference on all the Sharman.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.000]   You're working on it. We're working on a way.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.280]   Sam just saying. So far. All right.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:59.240]   Some, you know, I had used to think that our job as you go to CES or Comdex before it was to
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.960]   figure out what the trend line is, like to go there and look and say, well, I could tell you
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.600]   next year is the year of artificial intelligence. You couldn't do that. No.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:15.320]   This was definitely a talk here. TOCK. What's that? Oh, as opposed to tick? Yeah. There's no massive
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:20.120]   revelation of a new technology. This was just improvements, incremental improvements of stuff
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.320]   we've already seen. We still seem a little bit more of that self-aware and ambient compute and
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.840]   stuff though. It's all moving the edge, but that's going to that's just the trend. That's probably
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:36.600]   going on for years, right? Jason found a tick. I found five of them. Oh, really? And I wrote a
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.880]   whole story about it. I did put it in the notes. Yes. I see it right here. The five biggest
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.480]   tech trends. In fact, that's what launched this so that you could talk about this.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:54.120]   Oh, you were queuing me. Thank you. I was queuing. So you're good. So to your point, Leo, a lot of
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.600]   what it's about is trying to find like where are the tectonic plates moving? Yes. Yes. Because
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:05.960]   they do. They do. They move very slowly. And when you're at CES, you're overwhelmed with 40,000
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:11.320]   products, right? So you can lose the forest in the trees like that. It's really hard to see the
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:18.040]   forest in the trees. So I think I'll sort of just sum them up super quick. One was like the
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.920]   impossible pork thing where they're making fake pork. Pork is the most consumed meat in the world.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.160]   I love pork. They made a big splash last year. Yeah. Is it good pork? I haven't had it.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.040]   I didn't try it either. It's actually really good. They were handing out sliders. You're
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.160]   really good. I brought one back just for you. It's only a few days old.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.360]   The white castle ones. Yeah. They're making white castle sliders. But out of impossible
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.720]   this was better than Impossible Burger. Was it? Yeah.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.400]   The mouth feel. The mouth feel was better. Interesting. Yeah. Our team thought so too. I
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.760]   get a plant based diet. I'm vegan, but I just didn't get to that. But I think because they made
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.000]   such a big splash at last year, it was kind of like the big hit of the show last year. Let me
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.840]   ask you, Jason. So are you a vegan for ethical reasons or for environmental reasons or health
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:08.040]   reasons? I guess those are the three big. More of the last two. I would say like three number one
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:14.520]   and two the second. So biggest one for me was health. I had some health issues mostly around
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.560]   environmental allergies a few years ago. And that was why. But it's also good for the
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:27.640]   earth. Meat is a terrible burden on the ecosystem. Yeah. 14.5% of greenhouse gases comes from just
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.360]   emissions from livestock by far more than cars, more than anything else. So honestly,
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:37.240]   the best thing to do would be whole vegetables. But there are a lot of people say, I can't give
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.760]   up meat. So the Impossible fills that gap. Is it though healthful and is it good for the environment
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.480]   or is it? I mean, what's the burden of making these meat substitutes? Is it hard? Yeah. I mean,
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:56.840]   this one, it's lower in cholesterol. It's lower in calories. It's, you know, but it's not this
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.400]   thing's not as good as going and eating broccoli and brussel brow. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, you know,
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.280]   kind of transitional. It's less expensive to make. It's less expensive to store. It's less
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:16.280]   expensive to ship. Good. You also use a lot less land to make one of these and water than you use
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.520]   to make meat. So with all of those. So it is better with all of those cost savings. Is it
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.960]   being passed on to the consumer? No, it is not. So this is the problem that we're having.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.240]   But now we're getting a Burger King that's still being sold as a premium experience.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.800]   Not like it was. I remember when Sergey Brin ate the first fake burger and it was like a hundred
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.720]   thousand dollar burger. Yeah. That was 10 years ago. There's a Burger King right behind our studios
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.440]   here. I think you can get it cheaply now, right? But it's still more expensive than the regular
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.760]   version. And it shouldn't be. It shouldn't be because it's actually cheaper. It's a novelty.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.000]   It's a novelty. It's a novelty. It'll get cheaper. But it's also, it's economies of scale, right?
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.800]   Once they can make these at scale, it should be much cheaper ultimately. And it'll be more
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:04.280]   it'll be more economical to feed a lot more people because you're using less land.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.240]   So that was my question. Is it really an improvement? It sounds like it is.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.160]   It is. But it is. But it is economies of scale, you know, to Ann's point now and in the near future,
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.440]   it's probably going to continue to be more expensive to do these things because they're
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.520]   just not doing them at the same. So what's the trend? I mean, the trend is an impossible pork.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.680]   No, the trend is that food, you know, last year, it was a big hit. You could say, oh, that was a
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.840]   novelty. That was a one year kind of thing. The fact that it was like one of the biggest hits of
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.280]   the show again this year is really that the tech industry has accepted that food innovation is a
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.960]   valuable part of this industry. It's accepted this as part of the industry. So I'd expect you're
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.200]   going to see not just impossible. Probably next year, they'll come out with impossible poultry.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.280]   I would recommend or I would say is probably pretty safe bet. They've said they're working on that.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.480]   When are they going to make kale that's got meat in it? Yes.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   One of the things that we have to move past is this idea of, am I eating meat or am I eating
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.880]   meat? No, really. This is, like I said, this is for a meat eater who is trying to make the
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.720]   transition. I just need protein. And if the protein can taste great, fantastic.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:19.640]   Beans rice. One analyst said, I think very cogently at the show is that a decade from now,
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:25.480]   it might even be two decades, probably most meat that we meet, quote unquote, that meat will be
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.840]   plant based. And then the real meat will be a luxury. It will be a premium item.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:37.000]   There's going to be less of it produced. What if you didn't eat meat every day, but when you did
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.480]   eat meat, say once a week, it was incredibly good? Then I'd want to eat it every day.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:48.440]   And okay, no, that's my exact experience. Can I have a ribeye every day?
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.560]   No, but I actually for health reasons and ethical reasons and environmental reasons,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.360]   I do want to give it. I mean, I'm looking at that as my next thing for next year.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   I don't really have that option where I'm living right now. You could all you can use spaghetti all
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:08.760]   we have is pasta. I don't want to give up meat for the record there. No, that's a thing. I like
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:15.160]   meat. I like eating meat, but I have had impossible pork. I've had impossible beef. I've had a couple
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.880]   of other substitutes. They taste good. Yeah. And I mean, I mean, I'm not saying it's good for you,
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.960]   and it's not good for the earth. And that's the point. Yeah. Trend to driverless vehicles,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:33.720]   autonomous vehicles, obviously. Toyota announced what I think of as the most ambitious thing at
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.600]   CES, which was Toyota's woven city, which is this prototype community of the future,
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.640]   which has a very similar ring to Epcot, which in Disney World, which actually stands for
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:51.720]   experimental prototype city of tomorrow. But I think what the trend here is that they have said,
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:57.400]   look, most of today's communities, cities, especially are built around cars.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:04.600]   Yes. What if we built a community where there were no human driven vehicles? What would that look
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.320]   like? Even better. Let's just do it. Let's just build around pedestrians. Do we even need? I guess
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.120]   we need delivery vehicles. I'm more so with you. I'd rather a community be something where it's
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.880]   pedestrian friendly and a little bit more safety and not get hit by these massive machines.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:26.280]   No, you're right on. That's more the idea. I'd say it's not so much self-driving. The vehicles
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.920]   that you do have to have would be self-driving. But other than that, it's going to think about
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.920]   new forms of personal mobility. There's this little thing, for example, that came out the
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.520]   Wello. It's kind of like they caught sort of a tricycle for adults. It's more like this little
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:48.840]   pod that has three wheels that you can drive around when you have to go further. That's W-E-L-L-O.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:56.840]   And then there's other ideas. Obviously, bikes could be part of it. Walking, obviously,
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.040]   would be a big part of it. Make things like the the Highline in New York City where you can...
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.760]   Isn't that a great place? I love that. It's amazing. I love that thing. I'll take that. I'll
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.440]   walk to meetings and do that because it's a lot faster. It's great. Things like that.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:19.640]   So that's the idea. My point in this was that if this takes off, look for other communities and
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.240]   even companies. Because the weird thing is this is a company city. But there are
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.800]   letting normal people essentially move into this place, which sits at the foot of Mount Fuji
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:35.640]   as well. And the idea is if this takes off, look for other companies and communities to replicate it.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.680]   Super ambitious idea. Interesting. We'll see what happens. But obviously, it's a good thing that
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:48.280]   people are thinking of. How would we innovate? Not just technology or not just a product, but
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:54.920]   the way that we can optimize, the way that we get together.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.080]   A lot of companies had these people mover style little pods.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.960]   This is not the first time this has been at sea. Yes. 10 years ago, I actually dropped a link
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.840]   into the dock for this. GM did a concept called the Envy, which was the exact same thing where
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.920]   you would have the inner core of the city that only had these people pods.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.400]   That's where I met Sam O'Bool submit. He was working for Chevrolet and I wrote around in that
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.920]   Envy. That's where we met. It was kind of cool. They actually showed you, if you made it entirely
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.880]   driverless, you could do these traffic patterns that they didn't have lights. You would have an
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:32.040]   absolute arrival time at your destination. And then if you needed more, you'd just summon more
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.720]   pods. Like if you had cargo, you'd summon an extra pod that would carry van with your pod.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:42.040]   Health sensors were there. That's it. That's it right there. Which looks goofy, but it was
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:49.640]   actually very cool. It was designed for cities, obviously, where no vehicle would be. It's a
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.920]   segue. Segue actually had that fun little pod with the two wheel pod that balanced the program.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:01.400]   Yeah. Somebody drove it around on the show floor. Can't remember who it was, one of our friends,
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:08.360]   and the knob fell off and he crashed into a wall. But he wasn't hurt. So there you go.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.960]   Huh? Yeah. All right. Health sensors. Health tech.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:17.000]   Well, you look at, so this is based on the idea of, you look at just what's happened in the last
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.360]   few years, right? What you can do with the, you know, obviously the ECG and Apple Watch and other
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:29.080]   devices, like the ones from Whittings. You know, there's tests and things that you can run on your
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:35.720]   own wrist now, where devices that you've gotten for under, you know, $500 that used to, you used
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.360]   to have to make a visit to the hospital and get an appointment and would cost you thousands of
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:49.720]   dollars, right? So like a heart rate variability, for example, which is a, a, tests or essentially
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:57.720]   a sensor that tells you your stress levels. So that is something that you used to have to do,
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.200]   would be very complicated. One of the ones that was announced at CES, one of the new things,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:11.240]   so there were a number of new kinds of sensors or new-ish, like the PPG for optical heart rate,
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:18.680]   SPO2, your blood oxygen, and also allows some deeper sleep analysis that can detect sleep apnea,
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:24.120]   right? Right now you have to do these really expensive tests often to take care of.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.920]   We saw the better, for instance, which Micah Sargent loves, which is essentially a sleep study
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.040]   in your bedroom because you've got this thing glued on your forehead. Leo, you're wearing a
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.440]   sleep study right now. I thought I was getting a brain upgrade. You told me this would be a
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:42.520]   brain upgrade. So those are Bluetooth headsets. That's the cocoon relax, K-O-K-O-N.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.280]   Correct. So they're super low-profile. They're made out of material so that you can actually
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.600]   sleep with these things. I have been sleeping. You have little metallic, you know, electrodes inside.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.880]   That's an EEG. What? Right. So it can actually detect when you're slipping into unconsciousness
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.760]   and when you go into REM. I think I'm slipping into unconsciousness.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:04.760]   I've been trying this. The cool thing about this... Is it obviously...
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.840]   It does because... I would buy these if it helps. They've got the sounds of the waves,
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.480]   but as you drift off, it starts to lower the volume and then as you slip in the REM,
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.560]   it will switch in the white noise. I need to try these. Yeah, they're actually very...
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.600]   Are you sure as you slip in a REM, it doesn't start saying
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:27.800]   REM. You are the Manchurian Candidates. By the Impossible Poor.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:35.160]   No, the app actually lets me know. I can chart the night. Like I spent this much...
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.520]   Do they sell this yet? Oh yeah, it's on Amazon for like $349.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.640]   Oh, yeah, yeah. So it's expensive. I'm like the worst sleeper at the studio. I need to try it.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.960]   That's why I wanted that. You should try to sleep in bed instead of at the studio. I think
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:55.640]   that'll help. Oh, that is spicy. Yeah. We try to not to sleep during the show.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:04.520]   $349 noise canceling headphones with Bluetooth app for sleep. That's my new travel set. When I fly,
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:11.000]   that's going to be what I'm using. Nice. Nice. It's just another one, right? Yeah.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:18.680]   So does it just the two things you can have waves or white noise? No, no, no. It's actually,
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.200]   it's a full Bluetooth headset. Oh, so you can listen to music too. Correct. And it's also got a
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.800]   plug-in so you can use wired or wired. You know, this is... I need this because I always fall asleep
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.120]   listening to my audiobooks. It'd be nice if it wouldn't say, "Oh, you're asleep. I'm going to pause."
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.920]   No, here's the thing. When you get to unconsciousness, it will pause your audiobook and like go to
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.960]   white noise. Oh, that's so cool. Then when you wake up and we start, I actually need this.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.280]   Because I fall asleep to audiobooks, but it's not a good thing because I'm chapters.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.800]   So new sensors coming to upgrade your health. That's trend number three.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:52.360]   Trend number four, according to Jason Heiner of CBS Interactive, computer and CNET.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:58.280]   Computers are folding like phones. Yeah. But a lot of the folding phones we saw won't be sold,
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:04.280]   right? Yeah. Samsung is rumored on February 11th to be doing a new Samsung Galaxy Fold,
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.720]   but it's going to be called the Flip. It'll be more like the MotoRaser.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:14.440]   Yeah. These make... So my colleagues and I were talking a lot about this last week.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:21.400]   And we think these things make a little more sense as tablets and even computers than they do on
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:29.960]   phones. The Galaxy Fold was really about a phone that folded into a small tablet at its core, right?
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.080]   So, but when you take this, the interesting thing about this is this horseshoe bend,
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.560]   which is the conference, the reference design that... I'm told the intel wouldn't let you bend it,
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.680]   though. Right? Like it's still very prototed. They said, don't touch it. It's bendable.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.280]   Just don't bend it. Yeah. You see it bend here, but don't unbend it or rebend it.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:22:00.200]   We went down to Santa Clara before CES and we bend it a little bit. So it's usable. It's just,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.960]   it's still, you know, early days. The folding phones I looked up close at all had little crinkles.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.040]   Yeah. It was not... It's not a screen that I would want to do that.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.800]   Is there a big advantage to having that bendable screen versus having a half-screen gap? Yeah,
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.800]   just two screens. Right. Because like the duo, like the duo is probably the best looking example.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.560]   Very nice one with a screen on the top and a small one at the bottom up of the keyboard.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.920]   And you have no reliability problems there. I think it's the versatility of it because
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.640]   what you can do. And yeah, I think you're going to see some of these where they just make two
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:38.280]   screens on each side and you don't have to worry about the bend. What's cool about the way,
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:43.000]   what the one that bends, and I do think it's the future even though if it may be a few years away,
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.920]   is when you fold it all the way out, it has a little kickstand and it's essentially either a
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:53.640]   17 inch tablet or an all-in-one computer, right? You just hit the kickstand, set it down. If you
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:59.800]   have a mouse and keyboard, then you're right there. You can use that as your sort of all-in-one,
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:05.080]   right? Imagine that when you're at your hotel room. That's much nicer than being on a laptop
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:10.440]   is having more like a desktop. And then the keyboard is like magnetically sealed. So it can
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.800]   the keyboard can snap to the bottom of the screen if you want to use not a virtual keyboard but a
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:24.600]   physical keyboard. So some of these things are just a really interesting idea on rethinking
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:31.160]   the sort of the usable concept of a computer. I commend them for that. It's important. We
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.480]   shouldn't just say, "Well, this is what a computer looks like for now and forever. We should start
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:40.840]   looking at new things." The photable tick is fine and dandy, but you still need some horsepower if
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:46.600]   it's just going to be, if it's not going to be just a huge Netflix device. Because you do photography,
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.760]   but not everybody needs that. Mary Jo Foley uses notepad to write her article. She doesn't need
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.320]   horsepower. So I think what this recognizes is there are a variety of users. You need that big MSI
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:06.200]   with a video RTX GPU and it's i7. You need all of that. You need a muscle machine, but not everybody
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:12.520]   does. No, you don't. But at 2.0, I should have that horsepower. Well, that's true. They are going
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:18.280]   to be a high-spect, and prove it kind of machine. Really? At least to start. Yeah, it's imagined
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:24.040]   as a very high-spect machine. I think with discrete graphics, don't quote me on that, but maybe
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.960]   you haven't said specifically. But what they were saying is they're envisioning this as a high
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   productivity kind of machine. Harley, that's because these bendable screens at least now are
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.800]   expensive, right? The $4,000 just by itself, the Galaxy. It's fair. You make one of these,
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.280]   you're going to go for that sort of smaller part of the market that it upgrades more often.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.040]   Anyway. We'll pay for power. Yeah. Yeah. Most of us are spending two grand on the system. We want
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.080]   it to be able to be our primary. Right. We really do. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:02.200]   Speaking, by the way, we'll get to number five, but speaking of Intel, I thought AMD did a pretty
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.720]   good job of serving Intel. They owned Intel. Intel had such a bad CES because people were hoping
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:13.160]   they're going to release a roadmap that shows how they're going to compete against Ryzen.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:20.840]   Nothing. It was just more of the same. It's, "Oh, we've got the Intel HexaCore. That's about it."
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.480]   And in the meantime, AMD is like, "Oh, yeah. This architecture, we could double the performance on
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:32.200]   it." We can make a 64 core chip. Now, it's a $4,000 chip. It's an AMP Pruitt.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.720]   Definitely is an AMP. It's Pruitt priced. I have now AMP Pruitt GPUs. AMP.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.520]   For the CPU. Yeah. Yeah. You got it all. I like where this is going.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:46.360]   I mean, I don't know who. In fact, it's a weird thing because I guess it's for,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:53.080]   they're calling for high, for HEDT's. They're talking for what is it? High efficiency? No,
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:59.080]   high. Anyway, high performance desktops. And actually, really, it's for professionals using
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.880]   3D rendering and that kind of thing. I don't know who needs 64 cores. Not even a gamer.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.480]   They did an answer getting into the GPU business. I mean, I thought it was pretty big.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.120]   Mobile side. But the GPU you want. Yeah. That was interesting. Yeah.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.480]   But I mean, is there space in the GPU business, you've got an Nvidia and you've got AMD.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:25.640]   And both of them are making incredible products. Is there really space for Intel?
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.080]   Because Intel is going to be playing catch up for at least the first four years.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.760]   They can play catch up, but they at least have the pockets to play catch up for now and do more
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.440]   in that R and D. I wonder how much, I wonder how much runway they do.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.120]   D was pretty much in the same position about five, six years ago. Yeah.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:48.360]   Yeah. You know, so. And I have to say, oh, to that point, you know, I think I have to say that
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.120]   I have a better, I have more confidence that Intel could build GPUs than they could build mobile
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:59.880]   CPUs, right? They try to go into mobile. Yes. Not good for them. But when it comes to just raw power,
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.720]   Intel is your company. Right. I think I have more faith that they could do this well,
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:12.280]   especially because GPUs are becoming more important in like high end compute and those kinds of things
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.480]   that are more server based kind of stuff. They have a lot of IP. They have a lot of expertise in that.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:24.440]   So I wouldn't, I wouldn't count them out on it. Finally, trend five. And I'd agree with you 100%
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.080]   on this. Actually, I agree with you on the whole list. Tech is getting less techy and more subtle.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:37.560]   Yeah. Today's tech is so flashy. It's in your face. It's like, if you bring an assistant,
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:43.000]   you know, one of these assistants in your house, which, you know, you really should think about
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.920]   before you do it, you understand what you're doing when you do it. But it's like putting this big
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.040]   thing, even if it's a puck, you know, it's like putting that thing in your kitchen or your living
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.880]   room, you know, or God forbid your debt, your bedroom, right? It's like you're putting this big
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:04.040]   round piece of technology that's either a giant cylinder or a small puck. It's, it's not, it doesn't
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:10.760]   fit in the environment very well. Right. So I liked and I think that we should feel good about
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.960]   some of the companies like the one that I have the picture of in the story is
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:20.920]   Mui Lab. I think it's pronounced. It's a, it's a company that is made the smart display made out
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:27.080]   of natural wood. So when it hangs on your wall, it just looks like a piece of wood. But when you
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:33.080]   touch it and it's very rudimentary, it's very sort of just getting started kind of look, but it has,
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:38.600]   it lights up. There are little LEDs that light up on top of the wood where you push buttons and
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.120]   you have a number of different things you can do. Much more subtle. The whole idea is to blend in
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.040]   with the environment, not be, you know, another piece of technology. This is what you were talking
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:53.240]   about. And it's edge computing. It's it says, the computing power moves from the CPU from the
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.720]   computer out to the edge. I think that's the true. That's a big 10 year trend for sure.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.960]   And has all the edge he needs. Sorry. What are you holding there? I'm currently holding that,
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:09.160]   that Ant Pruitt branded external GPU. That's actually from ACES. Right. This, this, this is what
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.720]   Intel is up against. I want to take a break. But Father Robert brought toys. I brought toys. Did
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.760]   you bring toys in or? I didn't bring any toys. Okay. So let Robert do the toys. You just holding
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:25.480]   Robert's toys from him. But we'll talk more about CES and if there's any other techniques,
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:30.040]   I guess we'll talk about that as well. Do you have a promo from last week? Because I wasn't
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.840]   here all week and I just wanted to see that we do anything interesting happened while I was gone.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:41.480]   Let's see. I hear there was a nice previously on Twitch. All right. We're finally
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.440]   here at the opening of CES. It's the front door.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:54.200]   I heard a showman paper has a robotic toilet paper adventure. So the classical white nasty burger.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:00.600]   Oh, those are good. It was way better than the most.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:08.520]   This was cool. That was the Delta exhibit. Yeah. The robot, the hell. Yeah. He doesn't look like
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:13.560]   a classic Mustang. Chris got the Mustang lights. I think he fell a series of the right. I think
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:19.080]   that's what he was doing. He's folding phones, probably the best phone that we're not going to get in the US.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:26.600]   This is what CES is all about, right? All of the reasons.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:37.480]   I always wanted that one computer, right? But there were thousands of dollars. Now you get one for
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.320]   99 bucks. Smarty, good guy. Check out my folks at Canon.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.960]   Ant was happy.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:50.440]   Scott Wilkinson is going to give us a tour of all the audio and video stuff.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:56.280]   That one. There was a lot of green screen. It's actually a video screen.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:01.240]   Go over there. As the camera operator, he's shifting around it. It shifts in perspective as well.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.640]   I have a feeling this is the future. It is absolutely the future, tell me.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:11.880]   All right. We're in the artificial intelligence and robot section.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:22.040]   This may be the best robot here. It helps keep you fed. Say hello to Twit TV. There we go.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:27.320]   Twit, now also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   You know what? That looks like more fun than it really was.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:03.000]   Robert, are you wearing it now? I'll tell you later. I said they brought to you by the Fox Mint
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.240]   mobile Ryan Reynolds phone company. Yes, it's Deadpool's phone company. I thought that was
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.760]   what I asked them. We were on a call with them. I said, does Ryan Reynolds really own Mint? They
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:19.000]   said, yeah. Yep. So if you're still using a big wireless company, you know what a pain those
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.800]   big four are. What are you paying for? Besides expensive retail stores, inflated prices, hidden fees,
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.600]   you're being taken advantage of because they know you'll pay. That's why I love and use
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.720]   Mint mobile. Same premium network coverage you're used to at a fraction of the cost.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:40.680]   They don't have stores. They don't have inflated prices, hidden fees. They don't have
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:45.240]   they don't have any of the stuff that costs money. They just pass those savings out of you.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.120]   They do have great tech support. Nice people who will help you get set up with Mint mobile.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:58.040]   No, I can't promise Deadpool will answer the phone, but somebody very nice. I love Mint mobile. It
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:03.160]   makes it easy to cut your wireless bill down to as little as $15 a month. They have a three-month
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:08.200]   introductory plan. What I did, I should have just done the introductory plan, but then I saw
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:14.360]   that for 25 bucks a month, I could get 12 gigabytes of data unlimited text and phone calls
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:21.160]   for 25 bucks a month when you buy a one-year plan. I said, I'm in. I bought a year. I said,
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.560]   that's the best price I've ever heard of, 12 gigs. And by the way, I haven't once touched
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:30.760]   even 10 gigs. It's more data than I'll ever use. You use your own phone if you want. You can buy
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.480]   a phone there. I like just bringing my own. You keep your phone number. You keep your contacts.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:39.320]   You keep your apps. Just the only thing you don't keep is that expensive wireless bill.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:46.280]   Start saving with Mint mobile. It's amazing. I'm going to move all my stuff to Mint mobile.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:54.520]   To get, I'm looking at my $90 a month Verizon plan for one line, one phone. And I'm thinking 25 bucks
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:34:00.680]   for 12 gigabytes. That's crazy to get your new wireless panges. $15 a month with their
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.280]   three-month introductory plan. Get a sense of what it's like. And by the way, they'll ship the
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.040]   whole box to you for free. You get the sim. You put it in. They have a little IMEI form on the
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.720]   site. You can see if your phone will work most. I was just talking to Roberto, who was one of our
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:21.400]   chatters. It's his 60th birthday today. His father gave him an iPhone for his birthday 11 pro max.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.000]   He said, "Can I put on Mint mobile?" I said, "Yes, you can. Just go to the IME. Find her
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.320]   end of the IMEI." Happy birthday. Mintmobile.com/twit. Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:36.600]   with their three-month introductory plan. I also have six-month plans, 12-month plans.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   You pick the plan that works for you. Mint, M-I-N-T, like the color.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:49.640]   Like the fresh flavor of Mint. Mintmobile.com/twit. We thank you so much for supporting
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.400]   this week in Tech. We thank you for supporting us by going there. You'll be doing yourself a
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:35:00.120]   favor. Mintmobile.com/twit. What did you bring? Show us toys, Father Roberts. All right. Well,
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:07.480]   we were talking about GPUs. I did stop by the Asus suite. These are the external GPUs.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:13.000]   Oh, my gosh. USB-C. This is really empowering. I love Thunderbolt 3. I love USB-C.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   This is a technology that means any laptop, anything with a Thunderbolt 3 port,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.080]   can have an external GPU. Both Windows and Mac supported, right? Windows and Mac support.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:27.320]   Although, if you're Mac, you can only use the... Not Nvidia. AMD, right? Because it doesn't support.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.160]   That's Nvidia's fault, by the way. Nvidia Stop Branding Drivers for Apple. This is me.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.320]   Now, the nice thing about this is once you get the enclosure, which is going to run you about
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:41.720]   $320 or so, you can always replace the card. It just holds... It's just standard card slot, right?
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:47.080]   It's a PCI Express 16 slot. So, you can take any of it. Like this is a...
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:54.120]   PCI Express 16 on Thunderbolt 3. That's amazing. So, this is a 1660 TI. It's about a $230 card or so.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.680]   On this laptop, which is pretty good. It's an i7 quad core.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:04.040]   A sequence that will take me 30 minutes to render will take me about 30 seconds to render
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.840]   when I plug this thing in. So, you know, Ant was talking about how he needs the Ant-Pruent experience.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:15.160]   Kuda cores. I can get my UltraBook, grab one of these, and when I plug it in, that's my Ant-Pruent
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:23.320]   experience. I love this. I love this idea. Now, I will say I've tested four different EGPU enclosures.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.520]   I was very unhappy with three of them. Oh, interesting. They kept crashing or they had
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.960]   weird driver inconsistencies. Is it typically driver problems? Yeah, horrible driver problems.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.120]   This is the only one I've used. The Asus One. It's also the prettiest. It's a very nice look.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.720]   It's very nice. It's very small. But it's the only one I know that worked immediately,
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:51.000]   Mac or PC. Just no problem. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Asus EGPU. This is their
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.440]   XG station Pro. XG station Pro. Right. Now, Alio, this one's for you.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.480]   This is a little something. Is it an impossible burger? Yes. Yes. I was hoping you brought me
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.760]   in a leather case. This is actually from Meze Audio. You were talking about something that was made
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.680]   out of natural materials. This is actually a set of headphones. Super flat response. Made of
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:18.040]   wood. Made of walnut. That's actual walnut. Wow. Yeah. They're really, really comfortable.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:24.920]   They're beautiful. They sound superb. They do feel. They actually almost as comfortable as the
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.160]   cocoons. And I have to say, one of the cool things about this, one of the selling points for me,
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:34.040]   was the fact that there's no glue in there. You can disassemble the thing entirely. That's huge.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:40.360]   Which means if anything ever breaks, it's very repairable. How much? 300. Actually, hold on.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:49.640]   The exact price, it's the 99 studio. And that's 310. You know, maybe it's Apple, but I'm getting
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.400]   used to the idea that you're going to pay a couple of hundred bucks for a decent pair of headphones.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.880]   It's just and more for a good pair of headphones. Now, you like this. I guess you're getting used
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.080]   to that. I know you like this. What? So most of you are probably used to carrying around.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.680]   You talking to me? I get it. I get it. I get it. Finally. No, you've got large adapters for your
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:15.880]   notebooks. This replaces that. If you've got to use using that new gallium nitride technology.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:23.640]   We had we did a triangulation with the GAN folks talking about what GAN can do. It's a new way of
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:31.400]   doping instead of using silicone, you dope with gallium nitride. And it gives you much more efficient
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.080]   transport power. More efficient. CPUs eventually might use it and then it'll get much faster CPUs.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:41.000]   But right now they're being used primarily for power. And I have a several of these. This is the
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.360]   anchor power port. Adam, right? PD one. PD one. I really love these because you get, you know,
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:54.040]   what is the size of a small wall wart? How many watts is this 30? 30 watts. Right. So remember,
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.240]   we're accustomed to being that only being able to charge a phone that can actually power my laptop.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.320]   Yeah. But this is out. This has been out for a while. Yeah, that's like, that's like $30.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.320]   Pretty awesome though. Yeah. Pretty awesome. Well, I have a bunch of them now. I'm all in
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.560]   an anchor anyway. I just whatever anchor does, I'll get it. Oh, you're solid, right? Yeah.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.920]   This was from the bowels of you bought a cross. No, you already have one. Are these rosaries? What
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.080]   are these? You might have heard about that a while back. That's actually the E rosary. It's an
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:26.840]   E rosary wearable tech. It prayers for praise for you. So you don't have to do. Seriously. What is
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.280]   what is it? Okay. Is it? Oh, disclosure. This was actually created by the office above mine,
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.000]   the floor above. So it's a Vatican approved. It is a Vatican approved. So it pairs to your phone.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.840]   It pairs to your phone. You're counting your rosaries and it tells your phone how many you've
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.360]   done. Correct. And it connects to the click to pray network. Not my thing. It's totally not my
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.560]   thing. But you know, I had it. It's actually quite attractive. It's very nice. It's kind of.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.120]   When you said the office above you, I thought you're talking about like, you know,
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:03.240]   oh, no, it's physically the office above you. You got the direct line.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:10.120]   Now when they get it to praise for me and I don't have to, that's what I'm buying. Actually,
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:16.600]   there is that mode because it's connected to a app. There's an auto pray. You can request
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.480]   prayers from somebody else. And then they can prove it by because the E rosary actually counts
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:27.320]   it out. Okay, again, I did not design this. I did not market. I'm going to be a Catholic. That's
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.040]   the way it ought to be. That's awesome. That's a batch file running. That's awesome. The best
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:37.240]   thing is there's a cheat code for that. Oh, no, Konami code up down left, right, down left, right,
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:45.800]   left, right, well, it's suspenders belt. What would you? That's hysterical. I don't mean to be
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.120]   sacrilegious, actually. Oh, it's a it's a very pretty rosary. It's actually, I've never seen
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.400]   one that small though. Is it good? Does it have enough bees? Isn't it has supposed to have more
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.400]   bees? It's a decade. It's 10. That's only 10. Right. So you just so it's really just the number of
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.440]   times you've said the Hail Mary and you just well, well, you spin it back and forth. You could you
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:06.680]   spin them side and then go back the other right? You just keep going around. So it senses it by
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:12.200]   Oh, you spin the thing. Right. So it's got an accelerometer, a touch sensor. Oh, wow. Can it
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:19.000]   tell if I'm asleep? Wow. Oh, wow. Actually, it's really pretty. It's it's kind of nice.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.320]   This is more up your up your alley though. These are the Iogear. These are the portable,
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:30.760]   what do they call them? The share pro minis. So I've been in too many places where I can't connect
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.240]   to a system. I have to do a presentation. So this has an HDMI port, right? And then what?
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:40.120]   Wi-Fi? No. Also, they just connect between the two of all they talk to each other. Right. You put
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:45.000]   this one on your computer, this one on the presentation machine, you don't have to get what's your Wi-Fi
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.040]   password. There's no Apple wireless. There's no Google wire. It's just you just plug it in.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.800]   It's a dumb device and it goes up to 40 feet. 2.4 gigahertz?
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:59.720]   No, it's actually I think it's 2.4. Yeah, because that's unregular on, you know, unregular. It's
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.840]   unlicensed spectrum. Yeah. Up to 40 feet works rock solids. So this is such a great idea because
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:13.160]   it's amazing the number of times that I go into a game and we can't get the PowerPoint to work
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.240]   or we can't get the video call to work. And the joke I always make is like we have self-driving
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:26.040]   cars, but it's 20 and we still can't get a PowerPoint presentation to work or we still can't get a
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:33.560]   conference call to work. Because it's just a problem that even today we have to call powerful IT people
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.360]   to call me. They had funds back, but I'm keeping the rosary. I'm sorry.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:42.120]   Well, actually, you know, this is this is the one that I got specifically for use on a plane.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:48.520]   You saw this. This was that showstoppers. You know, I saw it and I walked by. I said, I don't,
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:53.400]   but I'm glad you picked it up because what is it? It's a fanny pack. It's a fanny pack. You wear it
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.080]   in the small of your back. Yeah. And it's controlled by your phone. Yeah. And what does it do? It's just
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:06.200]   a heating pad. Oh, that's all it is. I do remember seeing you. But it allows you to go between 100
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:12.440]   all the way up to 160 degrees. And then you can set how long it was. That was the awesome. Yeah,
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.680]   I could have a nice warm little, you got to remember, I fly coach. Yeah. And this, this is going to be
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.000]   a lifesaver whenever I'm nice. Emirates, they just give you a person to breathe.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:32.120]   This is not is it on? I feel a little I just turned it on. It's warming up. It's going to warm up.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:38.200]   You will feel it. It gets it to like third degree burn territory. If you want it to turn it all
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.080]   the way up. Okay. Is that freedom rocks? Turn it all the way up. Good. You're now at 100 here.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.600]   Leo can control his own temperature. Is it going to screw with my rosary though?
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:54.440]   Eventually your rosary will explode. Wow. Look at that. 160 degrees. It is it is
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.280]   palpably warming up. Yeah. What does it have in here that gets hotter? There he
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.400]   yeah, there's just a little heating element. Is it airplane approved? It is.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:08.200]   The one of your triple seven had a turn back. Who makes it? It's a brand new company startup
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.880]   called Relief Heat. Relief Heat. I met this. Actually, you met the CEO too. I did really nice guy.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.040]   He made me a cover. And I said, no, all that Robert do it. Yeah, it's nice. We've got a cover.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:23.960]   Actually, now that I'm wearing it, I kind of really like it. Yeah. No, my father has serious back
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.200]   problems. You're just got to soar back. That's awful. Yeah. And he wore it for a while. And what he
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:32.920]   likes about it is you can make the heat pulse. So like, you know, 30 minutes on, 10 minutes off,
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.640]   30 minutes on. Tides points out that if you cook chicken to 160 degrees, it's safe. So I'm just
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.240]   going to leave this on. All right. So if we cook the other 160 degrees, you'll be safe.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:48.840]   Wow. And of course, you like these.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:56.280]   Oh, my you you you you, but let me tell you, I use the little type C, but I now want the,
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   they finally did one with a lightning port. Yeah, that's great. Because it's reversible.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.680]   It's expensive though. It's like 70 bucks. Yeah, probably at that's the apple vig, right,
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.760]   where they take a little license fee. So lightning on one side, USB C on the other.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.880]   You can use it with any kind of phone, Windows, Mac, Android. It's all good. I keep my you
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.600]   be key on my key chain. I think it's the greatest thing. This is that's what I have the 5c. Now,
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.000]   that other one, this is a weird one. It's a time see if you just to leave it in your computer,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.400]   right? Right. So if you have a computer that has a spare USB C port, you just leave it in,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.440]   but then what's the point? Because it's extra hardware. It's hardware that people would need.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.680]   Yeah. So if they have your computer, yeah, they can get it together. Your computer. Yeah.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:43.480]   Are you with me? I will not do anything online that doesn't have a hardware key requirement.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.040]   I'm I'm that paranoid. There's not that many things. You know too much.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.520]   Like other sites you can use?
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.280]   Hard to uncles, really? Gosh, yes. So everybody's starting to support that.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:59.400]   So all my Google properties. Google does, of course. And my use with properties.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.840]   Twitter does. Sprout does. That's right. All of the internal Vatican network stuff does.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:10.680]   So I'm all last pass and you book a you be keys for accessing the various things I need to access.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.040]   Of course, there are other companies that make these. In fact, I bought a open source
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.000]   version of this. Nothing's as easy as you be key. I have to say they've really made it easy.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.560]   I bought one from a company in China a few years ago. That might be a bad idea.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.920]   And then I found out that it was incredibly incredibly explicit.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:34.120]   You did. Oops. I got it. It's from Germany. So it's good. I think it's called a nitro key,
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:39.560]   but it's not it's open source. It's Germany. It's hardened, but it's not nearly as easy to use as
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.400]   a you be key. I was I wanted to see what else was out there. I like it that it's open source.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.760]   It's one thing I don't like about you, but co is they've closed source. Yeah,
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.240]   what they're doing on the other hand, nothing is as capable and and really if you're just using
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.880]   it for two factor authentication, you don't even see what the source code is. That's fine. What else
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.920]   you got one last little bit. This this is something that was sort of a this was down in the the
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:07.880]   Eureka park. I love the name. It's Oh, snout. I am not are you afraid of a fan of like the
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:12.280]   pogs on the back of your phone? No, I never understood why people do that because you can't I like
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.920]   wireless charging as soon as you put a pog on there, you can't wireless charge it. Kids do this is like
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:22.200]   a this is like a pog except it still allows for wireless charging. Oh, so this thing attaches to
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:28.440]   the back of your phone or to the case, it's not a pog. It's a pop pop pop pop pop pop. Pop socket.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.160]   Something about pop socket. Whatever the kids say. It's the same idea. So if if you want to use it as
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.240]   a stand, you just push this right in the middle. Oh, a little ring popped down. So now you can use
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:44.360]   it as a stand or oh, I might get that you put them together like that. Yeah, suddenly it's a
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:51.880]   fall hold it. It's called Oh, snap. Oh, speaking of the kids. One of our kid editors.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:59.640]   John has a pop pop socket. You love a pop socket. Do you use it like as an easel? So partly using
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.120]   it to hold it but partly so you can stand it up. I wish I had that on the airplane. I was watching
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:09.080]   a movie on my iPhone and I know what to stand it up. Yeah, wouldn't that be better? Wireless
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.080]   charging and everything. Yeah, the cool thing is this metal piece, it actually slides out. So when
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.360]   you want to wire this charge, you just slide it out when I see that. Yeah. Okay, I'm keeping this
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:22.680]   and I'm keeping the rosaries. You can have that. You can have that. No, no, no, I won't keep it.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.400]   That's not nice. That's actually kind of cool. I wasn't going to stop by until I saw the presentation
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:33.080]   of like, that's actually kind of a cool deal. Pop sockets actually came out at CES. I don't
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.520]   know if you guys saw this. They came out with a way to charge your phone with the pop socket still
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:44.920]   really. How do you think it's a ring power? It's called the pop power. It's ring shaped.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.800]   And you just it just so I'm not the only one that doesn't like it for that reason, huh?
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.040]   I just don't like it because it doesn't slide into my pop kit. Well, pop pop.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.240]   I pop my pop. Everything's pop for me today. This is fun though. Just you have to do both sides
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.840]   at the same time once they don't. The one action that I really like you press it.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.320]   It pops right up. I think that's kind of cool. It's like the old snap bracelet. How long? How many
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.480]   do you ask them? How many times I can do that? They said they've tested it to over 200,000 times.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.760]   You did ask them. Wow. Does it have a built in vape?
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:23.480]   Vape Nation. By the way, I don't know what's going on. My back is so hot.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:30.120]   I can turn it down if you want. You still got 24 minutes to go in this session.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.720]   White warm. Is this airplane approved? Well, we're going to find out. I'm taking a
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.720]   no on Wednesday. I'm not going to take it through security. I mean, you know, not while wearing it.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:47.400]   It's really nice. Actually, I'm I'm global entry. I probably probably could.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.160]   They don't care what you do now. You're a Vatican. You're a right. You're a right. I only get to
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.560]   carry my Vatican passport when I'm officially on Vatican business. What was your favorite thing
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.920]   at CES? My favorite thing was probably the virtual set from Sony.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:11.400]   That was cool. We showed that so they had the Ghost Busters ambulance and they had a dolly
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.040]   camera and a photographer shooting around it. And it looked like it was in an alley. They even
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:22.360]   had blowing leaves and stuff. But what that alley was was a TV was a crystal display TV.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:27.800]   Giant screen behind that that that vehicle. And when you were normally you wouldn't want to do
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.760]   that because as you go around the vehicle, the screen doesn't move. And so you can clearly tell
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.600]   it's fake. Right. But this had all of the beautiful perspective change when the camera moves as you
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.440]   as you move. And that could save so much money on a TV. I think a lot of movie makers will be buying
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:49.880]   this. That was really cool. It's expensive, but it's going to save them a lot of money. You don't
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:55.160]   have to build sets. Not something you would use or I would use. No. But still, I think movie makers
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.000]   experience. It also solves things like how do you make sure that your equipment doesn't show up in
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.560]   reflections when you're shooting? Because that's actually a lot of practical. Plus, green screens
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:08.440]   are so hard to light and you can't get a green screen that's slave to the camera. But this is so
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.240]   much easier. This seems like a great way to do it. You also like that to Canon that they were showing
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:20.840]   up. They had they read it a gamer. He was there. He was like a Twitch streamer guy. And he was
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:27.640]   sitting there. Yeah. He was sitting there gaming while the conference is going on all around him.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:32.920]   And they showed him instead of using a Logitech camera like something like the camera you're using
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:41.400]   Jason, he was using a Canon point and shoot the EOS M200. It's a mirrorless design M200 499,
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:47.240]   but it has an HDMI out that allows you to stream live stream live stream just like you would with
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:53.400]   any other webcam. So you get a much cleaner image and you can put any type of Canon glass on it.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.720]   It has the proper amount. So if you want to have something with a nice shallow depth of field,
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:03.240]   you can grab you a nice in-mount lens. It's like an F2.8 and just it'll be so pretty.
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:08.680]   I do want to get one of these. It was really nice. I'm surprised though that you didn't pick
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:15.400]   the 1DX. Well, they also showed us their most expensive Canon. I like the 1DX. The 1DX is
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.200]   going to cost $4.99 listed as the 2200 is great. That's actually great. The 1DX. So
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:29.320]   mark three. Yes. I drooled over it. It was $6,500. But I would take it. I don't. It's total overkill
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:35.720]   for what I shoot with Canon. Yes. I'm a Canon guy unapologetically. But it's totally total
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:40.360]   overkill for what I like to shoot. Now if I was going down to the Niners games or the Packers games
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.240]   or anything like that, or even shooting wildlife wanting to shoot birds and things of that nature,
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:51.000]   yes, that 1DX would just totally crush it. Leo is more of a Sony person. Would you be a
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.840]   Sony person if you weren't already invested in so much Canon glass? Sony's latest was a 7R Mark 4.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:03.320]   That's what we shot all of this with. It wasn't really a good choice for shooting video. But
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:10.440]   I was never on board with Tony until that one came out because they fixed the ergonomics.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:14.680]   Yeah. Okay. That's the first thing with me. I don't care what the camera is. Does it feel right
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:21.000]   in my hands? That's it. I think for next time when I'm shooting video, I'm going to take one
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.720]   of the Panasonic Lumixes. They showed us. They now have full frame mirrorless. And is this the
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:34.680]   one we saw? Yes, it is. It's expensive. It's 4 grand. It supports L-mount lenses.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:47.880]   But it shoots incredible 6K 10-bit video. You can hot swap the CF at stress cards too.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:58.200]   Really? You can. Nice. Vlog, V-gamut. So for video shooting. And you liked, and I saw you
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:02.520]   oogling the fact that you can take. And I wish we'd had this. If we could have
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.360]   another reason why I like it. Slipped the LCD out and flipped it around so you could see
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:11.000]   while I was shooting you what I was getting. There would have been so much better. So maybe
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:17.480]   for next year. Were you guys doing your shots on some sort of like a stabilizer? No, sir. It was all
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:22.840]   handheld. Some of your shots look great. I prefer not to you stabilizers because I think they give
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:29.800]   it a synthetic weird feeling to it that I don't like. I like gimbals myself. You like a little
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:36.120]   bumble in there. Some handshake is pretty good. I'm going for the battle star Galactica hand.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:42.200]   I know I had some hand sh*t. Which they're rebooting. Are they? They're rebooting it. That's
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.600]   kind of killing me. I mean, they did such a good job with it. They don't stop. Don't do it again.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.680]   That's bound to happen with all of this. I think though if you ask me my favorite thing,
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:58.600]   it would have to be any and one of the micro LED AK screens. Especially the big 145 inch
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:04.920]   one. The LG was showing the giant wall that Sony was showing. No, Samsung. Yeah.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:11.000]   Those things. Did you see the AK looking glass? Looking glass? Looking glass? Okay. No.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:19.320]   Imagine. Okay. I know. Holographic slash 3D bad bad bad bad. But it was incredible. So they had
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:25.640]   a demonstration in the seagate booth. Oh, no controllers. No headset. No nothing. Up to 50
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:31.480]   degrees. You get the full 3D effect and I can completely interact with everything in the image.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:37.400]   I can pull it out. I can use my hands. I could take a flashlight, shine it at the display.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:41.880]   And it knows what I'm doing. It actually illuminates the image. That's interesting.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.880]   I mean, it was it's one of the stealth stories of CES. That thing was an incredible piece of
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.880]   technology. You missed that. Where was this? This is a it was in the seagate booth over in the
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.800]   of the nation. Oh, man. It was micro LED. What was it? No, it's so it's they're using an AK display
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.920]   and then they have a proprietary piece of technology. They called their light light array. So again,
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.640]   up to Oh, this is that new light array. Light field stuff. So this is really interesting. We
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.120]   looked at Sony's version, but I was told it wasn't as good as the one you saw. It's the
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.280]   seagate booth and I had meant to get over there. I mean, 3D display I don't care about, but the
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:19.480]   fact that I could interact with it like VR, but I had no controllers. It was just my hands. Yeah.
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:25.880]   That was special. So these new 3D displays are direct view. You don't wear special glasses.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:31.400]   They're not lenticular because they're actually shooting. They're using basically reverse ray
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:37.320]   tracing. The light is coming out of the display in every direction. So as you move around,
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.360]   you're seeing just as you do in real life, if it's a three dimensional object in real life,
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.600]   as you go around it, you see the light being bounced off in different directions.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:53.000]   Perspective change. But yeah, we saw the one that Sony did. I was very underwhelmed by it.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.440]   I wish I'd seen this one. So it was one of these stealth press releases. They didn't mention it
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:03.000]   that much. I just happened to walk by it and then I saw people interacting with the elements.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.320]   And I realized that even from where I was standing way back, I could see the effect. I was like,
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:13.240]   wait, what is this? Dang. But does the seagate make? No, no. I guess they had some sort of
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:19.000]   partnership with seagate because it takes a lot of storage to be able to do these holographic images.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.640]   But it's a company called Looking Glass. Looking interesting.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.440]   And if you look at it, some of the demos that people recorded are just amazing.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.840]   So that was the other reason I didn't run over to see it because I thought we can't shoot this.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:41.240]   But apparently some people were able to. Oh, yeah. Wow. How big was this? It wasn't that big.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:44.360]   So it's like the size of Jason's avatar. Yeah.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:49.960]   I mean, so that's it's an AKA holographic display. Did you see this, Jason?
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:56.600]   No, I didn't see it. Yeah. Darn it. This is the other reason I freaking hate
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.680]   CE. It's so busy. Come home. And then somebody says, well, you saw the thing.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.720]   So big there, man. Oh, but it was hidden away. It was like, it was like, wait,
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.880]   you wouldn't know about it. You wouldn't know about it. Either word of mouth or you just happen
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.520]   to walk by it at the right time. That's the other advice. If you do go to CES, prepare an answer
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.280]   to the question. What have you seen? What's good? What's interesting? Because that's all
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:23.880]   anybody asks you. Because everybody's trying to figure out what what should I go to? Jason,
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:28.520]   do you besides your five trends, did you have a favorite product at CES this year?
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:34.280]   Can I do three? Yeah. Of course you can. All right. Cool. I mentioned already earlier,
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.920]   the one that really didn't get much attention, but I thought was amazing. It's um, it's
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:43.960]   solid that you can because you can buy the Stevie or you will be able to in 2020. The Samsung Q
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:49.640]   950. Yes. That's the bezel-less 8K TV that I was talking about.
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:55.560]   Whatever, since I saw this, so I saw it in our pre-briefs for CES, it's ruined me on every other
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:59:01.320]   TV. Like I just like, you know, I look at every other TV. I talked about what it did when you
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:09.320]   could, when you watch sports on it. It's, and obviously this was an 8K stream that, yeah,
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:17.880]   that was there on playing when I saw it, but it's just like, man, I mean, just no bezel. It's
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:23.000]   just floating in space. It's gorgeous. It is. And the screen is amazing. Obviously,
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000]   it's a huge step up. And you can do the stuff that we were talking about earlier,
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:33.320]   it can do that kind of ambient stuff. You can have artwork go and it can be there all day,
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.320]   and it's not going to have any burn-in issues. You could have a photo album of your family
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:41.400]   cycling through. You could have those ambient modes that we talked about like with a fire,
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:50.040]   or a book in a window where the breeze is blowing. The amazing thing is, it isn't even that expensive.
[01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:58.120]   It's pretty expensive. Let me think of what you know. I'm looking at Samsung's site. They say
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:04.520]   3,000 euros for 65 inches. Yeah, no, no, I think that's right. I think it was-- That's not bad. I
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:09.240]   mean, if you want to go to 98 inches, then we're talking 70,000.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:15.400]   So, the one that I was looking at was the 98 inch one, where, you know-- That's why. Yeah,
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:20.120]   yeah, yeah, yeah. But, yeah, that's insane. But most of us don't need 65 or 75.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:25.080]   65, we're planning. Yeah. So, this might be your next TV. It's--
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:29.000]   No, I'm not going to spend that much. But I love that.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.720]   It's interesting that they're using the QLED technology, which they've been using as a
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:41.320]   backlight technology for their LCD panels with a-- Is this LCD or is it LCD? This is not OLED.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:47.800]   It's not OLED. Oh, I thought it was OLED, okay. Their OLED won't start. It'll be a couple years.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:53.080]   It's just-- They are going to start using QLED with OLED somehow in some magical way.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.040]   Quantum OLEDs. They just announced that quietly last fall. Samsung display, which, of course,
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:03.320]   Samsung Electronics, who makes these things, they buy their displays from Samsung display.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.320]   Their own internal company, as you know. So, that was number one.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.160]   There's also an up point to rush and get an AK TV because you can't play anything on it.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:15.880]   Although, the upscalers are pretty good these days. The upscalers are terrific.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:20.520]   But, I mean, if you wait until there's actual 8K content, you'll get a much better screen
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:26.280]   for a much lower price. Exactly. I wouldn't recommend anybody go out and get this thing,
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.560]   but I just was amazed at, like, this is what the future is going to look like. I'm here for it.
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.320]   I'm ready. A lot of people who watch our shows are in business, and they want to do podcasts for
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:45.080]   their business, communic-- corporate communications, sales podcasts, a chance for the executive to talk
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.600]   to the people who work for them. If you're listening to podcasts and you're saying,
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:55.080]   "Why don't we do this?" It's not surprising. 44% of Americans listen to podcasts for news and
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:00.920]   information. Of course, businesses want this, too. But there's a lot of challenges, trust me,
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:05.480]   to getting your own podcast going. It's one thing to record it, and almost anybody could do that
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.000]   laptop, microphone, no problem. It's another thing to host it, to manage it, to distribute it,
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.560]   to keep it private, to publish it. And that's what UStudio does. A new sponsor to our show,
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:24.440]   I love this idea for a business. UStudio has an app. You can brand it with your company's logo and
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:30.360]   colors. You tell your salespeople, your employees, everybody you want to talk to,
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:36.280]   to download it, put the UStudio app on their phone, and now they can automatically subscribe to your
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:42.840]   show. Audio and video, by the way. In fact, studies show audio and video formats are up to 500%
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:49.320]   more effective than text. Email updates, so easy to miss, so easy to ignore. You sent me a newsletter,
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:55.640]   I didn't see it. UStudio can be implemented in hours. It can provide detailed analytics,
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.640]   so you know who's listening, who's not listening, when, how often. Think of all the ways you could
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:07.400]   use UStudio for your company. You could share weekly messages from the CEO. You could provide
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:14.120]   on-demand and engaging training to employees, interview happy customers instead of just putting
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:19.160]   written testimonials in your website. Spread company news. By the way, it doesn't just have to be
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:23.640]   your employees. You can also share it outside your company. I think you'll like the idea that you
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:29.720]   can keep your confidential business information confidential because they have security and privacy
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:35.160]   built into the app. So your private information is never discoverable online. You can authenticate
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:40.760]   users using SSO or other authentication protocols. You can even restrict access within the company
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:47.160]   by department or seniority or location. So it gives you a very flexible way to publish podcasts
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:53.080]   to just the people with the need to know, to spread the word in your company, to keep your employees
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:04:00.040]   excited, engaged, download on-demand UStudio. Big companies just mentioned Salesforce,
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:06.600]   Robert Salesforce uses it, Nike uses it, Dell uses it. They all trust UStudio to power their private
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:15.320]   podcasts. U-S-T-U-D-I-O. UStudio.com, request a free trial and get a personalized demo. Tell
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.480]   them you heard about it on Twitter if they don't know. That's not good for us. That's the letter U
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:27.880]   studio.com. I think this is a great idea. They came to us and said, "Look, we know you've got a lot
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:31.560]   of podcast listeners. A lot of them work for a company. You're probably thinking about how to do
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.080]   it. I know people ask me that. They've been asking me that for years. How do I do this for my company?"
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.800]   It's easy to do the recording. I could tell you how to do that in a snap with a laptop with a
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.960]   microphone. It's the distribution. It's the management. It's the analytics. It's the keeping track of
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:53.240]   it that's so hard. UStudio will do it for you. UStudio.com. I thank you so much, UStudio,
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:57.640]   for believing in us. I hope you'll all try it out. UStudio.com.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:06.040]   The next thing on my list was the Withing ScanWatch that I talked about, the one that has the more
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:11.480]   sensors in it. I just really like what they did. They said, "Look, we're not going to try to make
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:15.720]   the coolest looking display. We're just going to make a really nice looking watch that has a small
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:21.480]   circle in it that has some of the digital readings in it. We're going to track a lot more." Your app
[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:28.680]   will have all of the data on it. It's like a semi-smartwatch. It's a super smartwatch. It's just the
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:35.640]   screen is most of the data and everything goes to your phone. This is the one that I was talking
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:42.040]   about. It can check for sleep apnea. It does deeper sleep. It does ECG. It does the PPG,
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:47.960]   which is an optical heart rating literally. Then SPO2 to check your blood apnea.
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:51.160]   It does, really? Do you know the battery life on that?
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:57.800]   It says an LMR featuring a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 30 days.
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:03.240]   I love that. How do you beat that? I will take with you.
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:08.840]   It's a real wristwatch. It has hands, a second hand. It's only got a little circular screen
[02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:14.520]   embedded in the watch. I like what they're doing over there at YThings. I think they really have
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:18.440]   some interesting. I use their scale, their blood pressure monitor. Maybe I should be looking at
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:22.440]   the watch too. I actually like that approach more because I don't need to repeat my mobile's
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:26.440]   functionality on my watch. That's what I want to be doing with it. I want something that if I
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:32.040]   forget to charge it for two weeks, it's not going to die. Did they quote a price for the scan?
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:40.600]   Yes. Let's see. It's in our story. It's $249 for the $38 millimeter, $299 for $42.
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:46.760]   Not bad. You don't need to get a giant screen anymore because it isn't a phone. It's just a watch.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:52.280]   The watch was some amazing sensors that literally five years ago you would have spent
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:57.080]   thousands of dollars to go get the tests for these things one time, one time.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:03.000]   Not available yet, but coming soon. Scanner watch. I just think big step forward.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:08.360]   Was that three? Did you get, was it all three? My third one was the, you guys are probably going
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:14.280]   to laugh at me on this one, but maybe hear me out. Samsung Galaxy Chromebook. This, I did not.
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:18.680]   Oh, I was impressed as hell. That's not a no one. It's expensive, but I was impressed as hell with
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:25.240]   that. In terms of design, one of the best-looking design laptops that we saw at CES this year.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:30.680]   It's the, I call it kind of the spiritual successor to the original Google Pixel.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:40.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a high-end Chromebook. This thing looks great. Super light. It's a great design.
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:46.840]   USB-C. They are selling more and more of these Chromebooks to normal consumers. They obviously
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:53.480]   have 60% of the education market now with Chromebooks, but this one is aimed. They have more, they
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:59.240]   now have 20% of the market in just consumers. Yeah, we don't see this in public schools.
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:02.440]   Yeah. You're not going to see this. Well, it starts at a thousand bucks, unfortunately.
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:06.760]   It's a thousand bucks. Yeah. But it's a high-end laptop. So still when you're using, one of the
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:11.320]   misconceptions about Chrome is that everything's running in the cloud. Well, no, when you're doing
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:17.320]   video, when you're doing a local, there's a lot of local processing that still happens on these
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:24.120]   things. And so this thing's going to run all of that stuff a lot faster, basic photo editing,
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:31.000]   video. Like I said, it has a great screen because Samsung, like we just talked about,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.320]   makes really good screens. I went to see this. I had a briefing with this and I did, I was like
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.800]   a thousand dollar Chromebook, really. And then I saw this thing and put my hands on it and I was like,
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:44.840]   wow, this is the kind of, I would love to carry a laptop like this. Chromebook can't do everything
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:50.440]   I need. But I was impressed by this, for sure. I just missed the video editing. That's, that's
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.400]   basically the only fun. But like we've got Jason, who is accustomed to the $1000 Chromebook. So
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.560]   that's the Pixel Chromebook. I have a Pixelbook. I love my Pixelbook. He gets a lot of use out of
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:04.040]   it. And that design, but this has an old super AMOLED screen. So you're going to get a gorgeous
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:08.760]   screen. It's a two and one. Absolutely. You'd have to buy a pencil. Is the battery life great?
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:13.880]   Did they say what the battery life would be? The battery life is like eight to 10 hours. Yeah,
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.720]   you give up battery life when you get an OLED display, unfortunately. And the thinness too.
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.520]   You have the thinness and then this has, I believe it as a, yeah, it has an AMOLED. So
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:29.560]   really nice display, very thin. So you lose a little bit of battery there. But yeah, it has
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:33.720]   Wi-Fi 6. You can get up to a terabyte of SSD storage. I don't know why you'd need that on this,
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:39.800]   but you never know. So yeah, I just upgraded my Wi-Fi at home to Wi-Fi 6. Because I think we're
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:45.160]   going to, you know, the iPhone's Wi-Fi 6, Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is Wi-Fi 6. So I have some phones
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:49.800]   that are, and I expect my next laptops will all be not the MacBook, but the other laptops
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:55.000]   that we're using. You could get that new Asus router that's coming out that has dual 10 gigabyte
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.400]   ethernet ports. Wow. Now you need to find dual 10 gigabyte ethernet providers.
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:06.600]   Wow. You could do it. Wow. Well, thank you, Jason. Thank you,
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:14.360]   thank you, Robert. Some great picks from CES. Lots of stuff. All of our CES coverage for us is
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:21.240]   at twit.to/ces. And where can people go to get your CES coverage, Jason Heiner? Is it all on
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:24.600]   cnet.com? Yes, cs.cnet.com.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:30.280]   CES.cnet.com. Father, Robert, you were just having fun.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:38.040]   This was part of the agreement. So when they asked me to come over, was actually before I
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:43.960]   started at Twit, they had been asking me to come over to do a special project in Rome.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:50.120]   How standard? And finally, my superior could come up with no reasons for me not to go.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.040]   And so he put it off. He put it off. I remember for the whole, your whole tenure at Twit,
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:58.360]   there was always this tension of they want, they want me in Vatican, they want me in Rome.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:02.360]   Right. And in fact, you remember in 2016, I disappeared for six weeks. Yes.
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:07.000]   The idea was I'll do the special project and then you'll leave.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.360]   That was getting the Pope on Skype.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:15.160]   I don't know. By the way, the Pope was on our Minecraft server. I'll just say that.
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.880]   Was he? Yeah, just for a while. You were showing him.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:20.280]   He came to our house and I said, "Yeah, stop by here."
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:21.720]   What? So we had all the cheek kits.
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:25.800]   What was that?
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.480]   Whoa, he's not Italian. What was that?
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:32.200]   Was he Argentinian? He's Argentinian.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.720]   I don't do Argentinian. That's okay. It's okay.
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:40.920]   But part of the deal was that they would let me do three major tech events a year.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:44.120]   So it's always going to be CES. Hey, Steve, what you doing?
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:48.280]   No, I'm sorry. He's not from Brooklyn either.
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.200]   The podcast, Deathcoin counts as one. Okay. And then one sort of, doesn't the public,
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:59.960]   it's weird that all of your wildcards are in Vegas? They ask about that and they tell them,
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.360]   "Look, that's where the conference is." It's also where your family lives.
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:04.680]   So it's convenient. And Dreamforce. I do Dreamforce.
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.120]   What did you bring there? You got some CES gear? Is it time for some
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.720]   environment? Are we allowed? I think we are. So this was actually given to you.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:14.760]   I'm sorry, Jason.
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.280]   Well, I mean, we could force them on the avatar. This was given to me, but you have it.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.720]   This was, well, it was given to me to give to you. Oh, what is it?
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:28.120]   Well, if I can get it open. Oh, man, careful with the scissors. I know.
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:34.920]   This is from Funeranium Phil. Oh, he knows I love his cold,
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.480]   brewed, crack blood of the earth. That is the best coffee ever.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.320]   It is so smooth. I actually own his special Funeranium mug.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:51.000]   I mean, this is great. Funeranium. Funeranium. Like Uranium, but it's fun.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.240]   Yeah. And like Uranium, it will make you vibrate. This guy created the best cold brew.
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:02.040]   Is he a chemist? I think he is. He's the laser safety officer at Berkeley.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:09.240]   So Berkeley Labs, right? Wow. He's coming over to my house, probably in October.
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.400]   Is he? He's going to get all the priests hopped up on Black Blood of the Earth.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:16.760]   Well, we have not an issue. When I went down into one of the sub basements,
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.840]   we actually found a radioactive hot source. What? Yeah, it was an old, like one of those floor
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:27.640]   scopes in the basement at your house, in the basement of our house. The Jesuit house in the
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:33.320]   Vatican. Yes. Yes. So he wants to come and make sure that we haven't contaminated the area.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.360]   It does warn drink. Keep refrigerated. Shake before serving drink with caution.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:43.640]   I love this. High caffeine content. Super high. This is enough to kill a horse in this bottle.
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:48.440]   Oh boy. So careful. And we're drinking it. And we're drinking it. That's nice. This
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:51.640]   show is going to get very energetic. But you've had cold brew before. So it doesn't have
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.760]   a fine quantity from him forever. It's awesome. Actually, he inspired me to set up my own
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:00.920]   co- I had my own lab for a long time. I saw that. That was beautiful. What happened to it?
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:06.840]   People thought I was making meth. No, there's a reason for it. What's the matter? Breaking bad
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:13.640]   caffeine. What's the matter? What the hell? Somebody gave me a Clemson mug. What do you know who
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:19.160]   I'm rooting for in the National Camping? Tomorrow is totally on purpose. That was totally on purpose.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.640]   Did you give me this originally? No, I didn't. I think a fan brought a Clemson mug. And then
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.080]   somebody from Michigan brought me a Michigan mug saying you can't be using that Clemson mug.
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:32.280]   And it's just gotten worse. I have no way. I gave you that mug just now because that is the center
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:37.160]   camera. Jason, I'll ask Bill if he'll send you a carafe. Oh, yeah, you should get to know
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:44.120]   fun or fun or alien bill. Actually, don't drink coffee or just caffeine in general.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.760]   Yeah, you're getting the jitters. Stick with the impossible. The smart one of the crowd.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:54.120]   This is so good. You know, it's supposed to have no bite. You don't normally put cream in
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.960]   my coffee. You don't need it. You don't have to. No cream. No sugar. It's going to be the first 12
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.720]   hour twit. You can also mix it. Use this a mixed drink. Just get started. If you want to get really
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:09.080]   drunk, but not be able to pass out. Okay, I feel really bad because Wesley brought his wife,
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.200]   Millie, they're from Lancaster, PA. And when I said the first 12 hour twit,
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:20.840]   Millie actually said what in his head? What have I done? Wesley, how could you?
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:26.840]   Okay, no, we're all you know what? We're almost done. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:34.600]   Lancaster. As few syllables as possible. Looks like like Louisville. Louisville.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:38.280]   I learned how to say from you, Jason, hi there. Louisville. Are you still in Louisville?
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:45.000]   Yeah, I'm still Louisville. Oh, I love it. I still want to come out for for Derby Day. Me too.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.320]   Wouldn't that be fun? Yes. I should forget. See, yes, let's do twit from Derby Day. Please.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:55.000]   And again, I will repeat my request for the twit, Airstream trailer. That would be perfect.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.920]   Just drag it out there. Permini studio. Hospitality suite.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:04.680]   You can put it in our parking lot. Let's make it. Wait, CNET goes to Derby Day?
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:08.680]   No, our office. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.720]   Didn't you used to have though a big, big tech republic,
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:16.840]   hospitality suite? Well, tech republic was a startup. Tech Republic
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:25.960]   started in 1998. We launched on May the 4th, 2000, or sorry, May the 4th, 1999.
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:34.120]   And when back when money was cheap and run by VC, tech republic had a
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:42.680]   booth on millionaires row, a spot on millionaires row. That's called using the VC wisely.
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:50.760]   That's right. Yeah. I had to get the, I mean, let's be honest, on Derby Day, it was only the sales
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:56.440]   people and the executives and big clients, right? And then the day before, which is called Oak
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:04.680]   Stay, that's when the staff, you sort of raffled off tickets for staff to come and do it. So, yeah.
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:08.440]   That's the end. Cool stuff. There is so much more. In fact, there's a ton of more CES stuff,
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:17.480]   but honestly, I feel so bad for a millie. I just, I just think we should, we should just raff this up.
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:23.720]   Jason, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for being here. We just love what you do at
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:30.760]   CBS Interactive. Thank you for continuing to be a good friend. It was fun to see you in Vegas.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:35.000]   And I hope I'll see you next time you're out here. Yeah, what a blast. I'll definitely let you
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.440]   know and would love to come up to Petaluma as always. Editorial director at CNET.
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.880]   We have some of the best people come on here are like big shots at CNET. I'm thinking of
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:51.800]   Lindsey, just tour in time. Yeah. Yeah. Lindsey is. She's the big boss now, not just, she doesn't just run.
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:18:00.760]   She runs all of the tech brands. As well, she should. CNET, ZEET, ENET, Tech Republic,
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:05.880]   Roadshow, CNET, Español. Yeah, she's awesome. I've known Lindsey for a long, long time,
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:12.200]   and she's great to work with. Oh, that's great. Thank you, Jason. Thank you to Ant-Pruit.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.000]   You're going to go home buzz, but you're going to go home happy. He's just getting right out of
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.320]   the national. That's not the buzz. I know. Are you staying up all night tonight, getting ready,
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.600]   putting on the orange, painting the house orange. Oh my goodness. Yeah, I got it.
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:29.000]   I got it. Is there some sort of special ceremony that this plays? Lights, flags, everything.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.360]   We're going to sacrifice a chicken. You can tell it's his car in the lot. You saw his car in the
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:40.440]   lot with the flapping, Clemson orange flags as he pulls in. Yes, yes, this is every game we were
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:45.560]   bringing South Carolina to California. That's right. He's representing us right. That's awesome.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:51.080]   Because I have to say, I remember going to Greenville on big game day. And man, everybody got those
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:57.480]   flapping flags. And you can't drive anywhere. Oh, you can't move. Yeah, it's crazy. Wait a minute.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.200]   Wait a minute. Didn't you didn't we have that mug before and got here? Yeah, a fansent. I've had
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:10.760]   this forever. That's Oh, no, I'm a Clemson fan. A fan. He is. I love this Clemson not Z.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:20.200]   Clemson Clemson Clemson Clemson Clemson or as we know them, the big clam. That's the club.
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.880]   Be no tigers, tigers, tigers,
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:29.960]   Emperor, Marnate, hands on photography, focus on photography, catch them on all of our shows,
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:37.240]   regular on Twig every Wednesday. I'll see you then. Mr. Father, the right reverend, whatever the
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:45.080]   hell we call you. Father Robert Balazair, the digital Jesuit, Jesuit.org at Padre SJ on the Twitter.
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:52.280]   I am so sad to send you back to the Vatican, but it can only be a matter of time before the
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:59.560]   Pope filing since your hope was at some point he'll send me home. I mean, no, tell him Leo will
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:04.520]   wear the digital rosary if he'll send you back. I'm going to give it back to me. I'm going to pray.
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:08.440]   I might get in trouble for not wearing my collar. So maybe that doesn't roll. We can see.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:13.800]   I know you're a troublemaker. We got Kevin back there in the boot. So I'm sure he could fix it.
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:18.200]   I mean, I can you put a digital collar on? I don't know if the tricaster could be.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.560]   I will stay there as long as they want me to it. The one big regret I have is I think Rome is wasted
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:29.720]   on me. I have no appreciation of the history or of the food. Well, let me come out there and show
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:34.440]   you. Exactly. All right, Lisa and I are coming out. We're going to be tourists and you're coming
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:38.360]   with us. We're going to go see every time. I have a place where you can actually broadcast from.
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:43.640]   So you can even continue your slate of shows in between. I don't know if I could stand for
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.760]   you to be gone for another month. So soon, sir. Sorry. All right.
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:51.720]   But you can hold down the four. We can hold down the four. That is nice when you hear now.
[02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:55.240]   I noticed this that the Christmas picture that you sent out this year, there were so many new
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:00.040]   faces. Isn't it amazing? And I looked like a huge giant in that picture. Yeah, you can't miss
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:08.440]   Anne in the middle. All of us tiny people. And it's like, we do this week in tech. It's fun to be
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:13.480]   back. Thank you, everybody for tuning into our annual CES Extravaganza. We do this show every
