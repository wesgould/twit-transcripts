[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.520]   to show the covers your tech needs online and off.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   And here we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   gathered the week before Christmas with the best damn cast
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.280]   ever.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.000]   I don't know how we did it, but thank you, Eileen,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.680]   for finding these people.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.400]   You're welcome.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960]   Everybody, we thought everybody be on vacation.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.200]   We are really thrilled to have Andy Inaka with us.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   Of course, he's one of our hosts on Macbreak Weekly,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.080]   hosts in Akko's Journal on the 5x5 network.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   And he's a esteemed writer for the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.320]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.600]   Leo, it's nice to be seeing you late at night.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.480]   We don't normally gather at this hour.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.040]   You've been on Twit before, though, right?
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.200]   I mean, this isn't a first.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   A while ago.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   It's not since I've had to reset my studio for evening lighting.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.040]   Did you actually reset for evening lighting?
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.480]   I actually have resetted.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   There is ambient lighting and also a warming filter on the lens.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   It looks good.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.720]   And so do June--
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.320]   No, who is that?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.880]   That's Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   Rosemary Clooney.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.680]   You know, I just think of her as the woman in a moo moo.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.120]   And so when you see the young Rosemary Clooney,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.320]   it's like, wow, she's gorgeous.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   It's like college pictures of your mom, almost.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.040]   I think I've earned the paper towel commercials.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.960]   Exactly.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.480]   Down to you.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.280]   The quick picture.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.960]   Extra value is what you get when you buy corn.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.400]   And you like corn.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   Very good.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.880]   Wow.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.520]   That's Harry McCracken of The Technologizer.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.840]   And apparently, a fan of old commercials as well.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.600]   Thank you, Aaron.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.080]   Thank you for being here, Aaron.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   No pleasure.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.440]   Also from New York, Neeliah Patel.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   Good to have you.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   Welcome from The Verge.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.880]   I told Joshua with this, you just
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.760]   doing such a good job with The Verge.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   We're trying.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   It's a slog, but we're getting through it.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000]   Well, from my perspective, it's just me
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.840]   yelling at everyone all the time.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.600]   I'm glad that's translating to something.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.640]   We don't hear the yelling out here in the real world,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   but we do see the result, which is a really fantastic website
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   with lots of content.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.560]   And increasingly, a go-to place for news as well as reviews.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.840]   And I got to say, The Verge show that you guys do, which
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   basically looks like Letterman is fantastic, too.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   You guys are doing a great job.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   We're trying.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.720]   You know, I think we said this right at launch,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.120]   but we launched with like 40% of what we ultimately
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.640]   want to do.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.400]   So we have a lot of work to hit all of the pieces that we want.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.280]   Oh, stop.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.760]   Just stop.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   You're putting the rest of us to shame.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.440]   We will talk.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   You have a good review.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   Actually, Joshua did it of the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.640]   Maybe we disagree a little bit.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.880]   I think Joshua likes it a lot better than I do.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.760]   And he took an opportunity to take some potshots
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.560]   at some iPhone lovers.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.840]   Do you want to do this to me?
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   No, no, no.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.240]   It's not you.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   It's him.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.800]   It's not your fault.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.360]   I quit.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.320]   I actually quit yesterday.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.760]   Hey, everybody seems to be quitting TechCrunch.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.360]   I bet you could pick up some talent there.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.400]   I just saw their CEO quit.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.120]   Wow.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.800]   Apparently, according to Mike Harrington,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.080]   now you never know with Mike, because he likes to stir
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.280]   the pot a little bit.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.720]   But he says, really, the whole problem
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.200]   is that Ariana Huffington is an egotist and demands
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.400]   to be the one in charge.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.200]   And he just won't tolerate anybody usurping her power.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.560]   You never worked for Ariana.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.440]   You left before--
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.400]   But the line, Joshua came from Angadget,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.200]   and they left before Ariana came and stepped in.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.240]   Yeah, we told them we were leaving one by one.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   And then they bought the Huffington Post.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   It was almost--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.720]   I was already at the door.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.480]   It was almost simultaneous, though.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.680]   I always had the feeling that maybe you guys knew something.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.880]   Well, we knew AOL wasn't a place we wanted to work.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   Yeah, that's probably--
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.360]   That's probably--
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   All you needed to know.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.200]   All you needed to know.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.600]   Oh, look.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.880]   We built a verge.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.400]   And--
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   I agree.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.760]   Great stuff.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   That was what we always wanted to do, and we got to do it.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.320]   And so it's sad to see what's happening there.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.880]   But the guys in Angadget, we're still fine with them.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.280]   They're trying their hardest.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.720]   They're doing what they can.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.600]   And they're doing a good job.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.960]   I just for some reason I imagine you taking your shoe off
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.920]   and banging on the table saying, we will bury you.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.080]   That's just me.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.280]   No, we-- they're friends.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.200]   We've known them forever.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.360]   Tim and Darren are running gadgets.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560]   We're doing a great job.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.000]   So let's talk a little bit about SOPA, PIPA, and mega upload.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Sounds like the Three Dwarfs.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The Stop Online Piracy Act, which
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.640]   is the house version of PIPA, which
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.080]   is the Senate version of SOPA.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.960]   SOPA has been marked up on Friday.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.800]   And interesting, because normally the Congress
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.280]   would have adjourned by now.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.080]   And I'll be home for the holidays.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.440]   But for reasons--
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.080]   I have to think is pressure from the music industry.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.040]   They're going to stick around.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.640]   And Wednesday, they're going to continue this vote
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.040]   on the Stop Online Piracy Act.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.920]   So I think, as an attorney, you're probably
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.440]   the best equipped to tell us what's going on with SOPA.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.720]   SOPA and PIPA, which is the Protect IP Act,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.920]   right now, procedurally, you've got it exactly right.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.160]   So the House Judiciary Committee
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.680]   was meeting to bring in amendments to SOPA.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.160]   11 hours.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.640]   These guys don't work that hard.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   So the 11 hours is fundamentally a filibuster
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.800]   by the opponents of SOPA.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.280]   Oh, good.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.600]   So they kept on bringing up amendments.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.240]   And they demanded to have the entire text of the bill read
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.760]   aloud.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.600]   Oh, good.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.000]   You usually wave that sort of thing.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.440]   You have to do it.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.280]   And they basically delayed and gave up.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.240]   And then the outcry in the press and from constituents,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.640]   basically, was so loud and vociferous
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.680]   that the next day, when they met again,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.480]   they said, well, we're journeying without a vote.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.200]   And we'll try again as soon as possible.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.240]   And normally, as soon as possible, in this case,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.800]   because of the holidays, would mean next year.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   And I think there's such a grandswell of opposition
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.920]   to SOPA and the concepts that represent to the technical level
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.960]   that I'm pretty sure Lamar Smith, the representative
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.560]   from Texas, who wrote the bill--
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.960]   And chairs the committee.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   And chairs the committee.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.800]   He knows you can't wait that long.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.680]   So I think he's trying to do it again.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   And I think he's just going to run into another filibuster.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   And I don't think any of the representatives who spoke out
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.480]   against SOPA are going to get fooled by this maneuver.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.120]   I think they're going to ask to have it read again,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.280]   introduce another 70 amendments to it
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.760]   in an effort to slow it down.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.520]   Now, I will say this about SOPA.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   SOPA is a bad solution to a real problem.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.720]   And what I worry about--
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.200]   and I'm writing a piece this week about it--
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.000]   what I worry about is that we have spent so much time,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   sort of as the internet community,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.640]   focused on the bad solution.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.040]   The bad solution is we'll screw with DNS.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.600]   We'll screw with what Google puts on its search results,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   all of which are bad.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.920]   I think everybody agrees that these are bad solutions.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.640]   But we've spent so much time focused
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.040]   in being outraged by the bad solution
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.800]   that we haven't spent any time thinking
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.480]   about a good solution for a real problem.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.760]   And so what SOPA basically is a response to the fact
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.120]   that the internet, by design, does not respect
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.040]   the existence of the United States.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's a political entity with laws.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.480]   It doesn't.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.160]   That's the internet--
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   For any country, it's transnational.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.400]   Right.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.200]   So the laws of the United States
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.840]   don't apply to some server in Slovakia or whatever.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.080]   So if I start mega upload in--
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   I don't know-- Kansas City.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.440]   And I host all these files that are copywritten
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.240]   and I'm dealing them out to people, which
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.520]   is copyright infringement, I can get sued.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.440]   Just the way Groove Shark just got sued
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.080]   for distributing music illegally the way--
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.680]   because all got sued the way YouTube got sued.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.240]   And because we're citizens or private actors in America,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.360]   we can resolve our dispute under the rule of law.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.160]   You can't do that when the servers in Hong Kong
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   or wherever Eastern Europe.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.680]   And so basically what we're saying
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.320]   is, well, there's this place where
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.280]   you can go to get copyrighted and fringing material
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.400]   somewhere in the world.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   And in order to stop it, well, we can't.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.080]   We can't go over there.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.960]   So we'll just blow up all the roads.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.440]   Screw it.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.240]   We'll blow up all the roads in all the highways.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.280]   And now you can't go there.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.080]   And it's still fine.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.520]   It's doing whatever you want.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.800]   But Citizens United States are protected from it.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.120]   That's a bad solution.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.600]   But there has to be a real solution to mega upload.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.920]   There has to be a real solution to the Pirate Bay, right?
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.280]   Allow content owners.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.680]   Because I got to eat, man.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.360]   You got to eat.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.320]   We're going to eat fine.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   What are you crazy?
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.960]   What are you nuts?
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.720]   I'm not crazy.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.880]   I'm not--
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   What the hell are you talking about?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.640]   They're asking--
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.120]   Show me who is-- wait a minute.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.520]   How much money did the motion picture
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   in the stream make last year?
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.640]   Record amount of money.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.160]   How much money--
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.040]   That's fine.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.520]   But that's fine.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.520]   Nobody is starving to death because of piracy,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.440]   and you're solving a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.800]   But this is what I'm saying.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.480]   Like you are-- you're insistent that the problem doesn't exist.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.760]   It doesn't.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.280]   But the real problem is that I have rights
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.760]   as a creator, as a copyright owner.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.720]   You have rights, as a copyright.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.600]   What happens if I take all of Andy's books
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.760]   and I start republishing them and selling them?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.040]   No, that's a hypothetical.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.360]   The point is, in the fact of the matter,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.200]   no one is suffering from piracy.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.560]   They think they are.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.720]   This is the old generation saying,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.480]   "We wish the internet and computers would go the hell away,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.200]   "and we're going to legislate it because they won't."
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.680]   This is not about--
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.040]   This is not about protecting rights holders.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.240]   But those are bad solutions.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.160]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.400]   You're listening to bad solutions.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.600]   They're never going to want a good solution in the life
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.880]   because they don't want the internet to exist.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.720]   That's true.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.560]   I don't care about them.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.400]   I think they're about it.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.240]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.080]   I'm saying.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.200]   But you and I, we should be smarter than that.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.000]   We should say, what are the real solutions
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.120]   to pervasive copyright?
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.560]   If there were a problem, I would say that.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   There isn't a problem.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.400]   There is a problem.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   Mega-upload exists.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.600]   It takes content from people.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.880]   It distributes to other people.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.720]   And nobody pays--
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.120]   I'm not saying that that doesn't happen.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   I'm not saying the pyro-beta exists.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.400]   Let me give you a really simple, non-hypothetical solution.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.680]   Or a problem.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.600]   People scrape the verge all the time.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   They take it away from us.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.440]   And he can ask Josh, I'm not cheap.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.840]   I don't work for free.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.720]   What is Vox Media supposed to do when somebody takes the verge
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.640]   and republishes all of our content?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.000]   What happens?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.720]   Say thank you.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.960]   Thanks for the publicity.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   Are you losing money?
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.600]   Are you not able to make a living?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.400]   Why should I allow that to happen?
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.640]   Because you're a tight fist at night.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.600]   Because you're being tight-fisted about this.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.840]   Let it go.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.320]   I don't think that's right.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   No, I do think it is.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Let it go.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   Let it go.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.320]   You can't go with me.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.480]   You can't.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.720]   That's your legislation now.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.240]   So now you want to go to comments with--
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.080]   Well, you got no choice.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.680]   You can either break the internet or you can live with us.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.560]   I don't think that-- I think that's a false choice.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.120]   And I think that's the problem I see with SOPA.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.960]   SOPA is bad.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.240]   And I don't think it should pass.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.640]   I don't think it should work the way it works.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   But we're not--
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.520]   You know, I look at somebody like Louis C. K., who uncopy protected, put out his video
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.520]   of his comedy performance.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.800]   But what happens to Louis C. K., when that hits the Pirate Bank?
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   It did hit the Pirate Bank.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.360]   And he still made a million dollars on it.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.680]   He didn't make $10 million.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.480]   He made a million dollars.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.960]   So now you want to legislate.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   You write the comment.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   That's not legislation.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.400]   It's the fact of the man that the technology exists.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.760]   The only way to stop it is to break the technology.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   And I'm telling you, the rights holders will not stop until the internet and computers
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   go away.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.720]   That is their goal because they want to turn back the clock.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   Okay, Andy, you're just--
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   So I don't disagree with you.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   Andy moderate this battle.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   I think it's really--
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   Go ahead.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   Finish them.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   Go ahead.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   Then Andy, sorry.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   I don't support SOPA.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.520]   I think SOPA is a stupid terrorist.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   We're all in agreement of that, obviously.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.760]   Okay.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.320]   But this idea that you can just tell me that I have to give up some of my rights because
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.560]   you want some stuff to be free is ridiculous.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   And that is a problem.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.000]   And we won't actually get better solutions.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.600]   We won't reach a compromise or a consensus in society about how intellectual property
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.440]   should work when we have two sides that adopt maximalist positions.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.560]   The internet should go away or shut up.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.200]   It's going to be free and you have to like it.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.680]   There has to be a middle ground.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   You can't tell me the problem is too hard to solve.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.760]   Nobody's saying that copyright shouldn't exist.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   And nobody's saying that property rights shouldn't exist.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:55.680]   But if in the real world they're difficult to enforce and you can't demonstrate damages,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.400]   and this has been a difficulty all along, demonstrate the damages to me, please, and
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.280]   it's not possible, then I have to question whether there needs to be affixed to this.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.280]   We have the internet.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.760]   If I lose $1, that's enough damages for us as a society, he said, well, how do I protect
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760]   the dollar?
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   Right?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.640]   Not if the cost of protecting your dollar is completely diminishing, something that's
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   changing the world.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.960]   But I'm not asking you to do that.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.680]   I don't think there's a solution.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   What is the solution?
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.400]   You're saying it's too hard, right?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.920]   It's impossible.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.920]   I don't think it's impossible.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   Of course it is.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   As soon as something is bits, no, as soon as something is bits and transmitted internationally,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   you're done.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.960]   So you have to start to think about living in today's world, Nielei, not 1950s.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.920]   I don't think you can accuse me of living in the 50s.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   Well, I know that's why I'm always surprised when you make this argument because I don't
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   understand what world you're living in.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:51.000]   Once stuff is bits, it's copyable, perfectly, transmittable at the speed of light, done.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.120]   Anything that you do to change that breaks the internet, breaks this technology.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   You could put TPM chips into computers and insist everything have DRM.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   That doesn't stop pirates.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.120]   Nothing we've ever done stops pirates.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   It only stops you and me, honest people.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.280]   No, I agree with that.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.440]   I don't think that that, I mean, it's not like we try to introduce security on a new
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.440]   new economy.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.760]   How do you make uncopiable content?
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   You can't.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.040]   I don't think that that's like a technical solution.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.720]   No, there is no technical solution.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   Just look at it.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   There's no technical solution.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.080]   There are bits.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.840]   So why don't we have legislative or diplomatic solutions to the problem?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   We do.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   We have plenty of laws.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.920]   We have plenty of laws.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   Do we not have enough laws?
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.120]   So why don't instead of SOPA, which in prize to impose a ridiculous technical solution,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   why don't we have a framework by which rights holder can go?
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   We do.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   It's called the DMCA.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.320]   How well has that worked?
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.800]   It actually works really well in the United States, but it only works within the borders
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   of the United States.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.040]   The problem, SOPA is only about what happens outside the United States, right?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.880]   Because I can sue Google if they don't respond to my DMCA request.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.640]   I can sue a rights somebody who copies my word.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.200]   So I again, this just poses this problem.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.280]   It's an international, transnational, not even international technology that what do
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   you do?
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.640]   Are we going to have a national, maybe we should create a world government.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   That's a good idea.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.800]   You know, I'm sorry, we solve problems at the international scale all the time.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.880]   WIPO has tried to do this for five years.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.000]   ACTA is the best they came up with, the three strikes bill.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.600]   There isn't a way to solve this because I think this is a fundamental misunderstanding.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.560]   The way this stuff works is stuff is transmitted, turns into bits, which you cannot stop people
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.680]   from copying.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.840]   You cannot stop people from copying.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.560]   You cannot stop people from transmitting at the speed of light.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.480]   What can you do to do that means you're going to say, okay, technology, stop working.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.240]   No, bad technology.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.120]   Let's make it half the speed of light.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.840]   Let's make it half bits.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.840]   You can't do it.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   But you keep telling me about these technical solutions.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.400]   That's what I'm saying is that these are bad ideas, right?
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   I agree with you.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   Right.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.640]   So I'm asking, well, what's a good idea?
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.800]   I think there are, there have to be better solutions to pervasive, great, and friendly.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.320]   I'm willing to entertain them.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   I'm just wondering what are them.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.800]   I'm saying in the United States, we have come up with a framework that actually most people
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.080]   think works fairly well.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.440]   And then you get this, then you get a universal music group and this thing starts to break.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   So that's different.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   We should get to that.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   We are going to get to that.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.920]   But before we do that, let me give Andy a chance to weigh in because poor Andy and
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.360]   Harry are just sitting here.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.840]   And by the way, you know, this is a very important discussion.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.520]   I'm really glad that you're here to represent that point of view, even though you're completely
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   wrong.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   Okay.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520]   No, no, no, I think this is-
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.760]   That's why I come on this.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.640]   No, I think this is great.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.560]   And I would love it if we could come up with a solution.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.640]   But I just think because I think to me it's a priori impossible.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   But let's see what Andy has to say.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.840]   Really all I wanted to say is I think- I agree with Niele nearly 100%.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.280]   Only in the sense that our opposition to this is very, very important because this
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.400]   is a far, far too overreaching sort of legislation.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   It gives far too big a club into the hands of a private company interest as opposed to
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.440]   lolling the freedom of the internet to have its own say and have its own response to those
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.720]   kind of acts.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:20.800]   While we are- we should not delay and not reserve ourselves in trying to get this thing-
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   get this- for at this thing from becoming law, let's not forget the fact that this is
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.400]   a real problem of a distribution of illegal content of the internet.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.520]   I'm in the business right now of trying to- in 2012 I really want to do a lot of self-publishing.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.680]   And over the past year I've been looking at so many different solutions for do I publish
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   under DRM?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.960]   Do I just let people download a free and open ePub?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.680]   And there is no solution to the problem that doesn't end with me saying I have to be okay
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.880]   with the idea- excuse me, not- I don't have to be okay with the idea that a lot of my
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.960]   stuff is going to be pirated.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.160]   But I have to accept that the price of securing my content to prevent that from happening
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.240]   is higher than the benefit of locking it down.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.400]   I do think that- I do think that we- I think that if we really had a focus and a commitment
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.680]   to solving this problem, I think we could find a way to serve the needs of both copyright
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.200]   holders and don't think of just of universal music.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.020]   Think of guys like me, think of a friend of mine who works for literally a three-person
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.200]   animation company that you probably know- I wouldn't mention this person's name just
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   in case they wouldn't like their name to be mentioned, but this is an animator whose
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.640]   name is pretty well known, who does all the animation himself.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.440]   And one big part of my friend's job is going onto YouTube, going onto all the file size
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   to look for copies of his shorts.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   Impossible.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   Right.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.920]   Well, no, no, no, no, it doesn't work well because the two points there is that there
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.160]   are mechanisms in place via YouTube where he can say that, okay, here's a copy of our
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.040]   seven-minute short that was not posted by us.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   Could you please take this down and they have the legal wherewithal to make that happen?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.400]   That's why it's an important law.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.800]   And the reason why it's important is not because this little three-man animation studio is
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.880]   trying to preserve its billions of dollars for the profits, but because that DVD that
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.040]   they sell with these five or six really popular shorts on it, that's how they fund their next
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   movie.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.320]   They operate on a shoestring.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.720]   And if that 15% or 20% of their annual budget were to go away, they wouldn't be able to
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.960]   make those movies anymore.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.880]   So, Neale, I'm with you.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:26.080]   I'm with you that while we are mobilizing against this legislation, not forget that it's a bad
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.880]   sucky thing, that it's so easy to pirate content and it's so hard to adequately defend
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.680]   yourself against that sort of stuff.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.200]   If you are the creator of that stuff and you just want some have not even just get the
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.520]   money off of it, but at least maintain some control of how it's distributed and how it's
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   formatted.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.840]   Harry, do you have anything to say?
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:53.000]   Well, I'm torn, but the one thing I know for sure is that the idea that Congress is making
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   decisions about this stuff is terrifying to me because the more you know about a topic,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.240]   the less confident you are that those guys know enough about it to solve it and particularly
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.320]   with something involving technology, I just don't feel that the people in that legislative
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.560]   body know enough to know the implications of what they're doing.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.960]   And they don't seem to care actually.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   Yes, exactly right.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   It's worse than that.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   Yeah, they're not seeking.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   I don't know.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.960]   They don't want to know.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.520]   I do feel I do believe in electoral property.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.080]   I believe that if you create something, it's okay for you to have some control over at
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.240]   and in fact, it should be legal for you to make stupid decisions about things you own.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.280]   If you want to hold it back, even if that's self destructive, maybe it's okay.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.640]   But I do just come back to the fact that nobody seems to have a solution that's actually
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   going to work.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.320]   Well, you know, it's like the store where you can't go in unless your bags are searched.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.800]   You cannot leave the store unless your bags are searched.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.760]   That's a fine policy for the store to want to make.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.960]   But it means I'm probably not coming back to that store.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.880]   The problem with this legislation is that we're asked these companies that this to continue
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.320]   the analogy, this store would go out of business for creating an environment that nobody wants
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   to be part of.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.360]   The problem with this legislation is that it would allow this to be simply the law of
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.520]   the land that we don't have a choice not to not to lower bags, be search, so to speak.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.920]   And I'm terrified about stuff that sounds like China might do at the sounds.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.160]   Go to the great firewall of China.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.080]   And you've got guys who do know about this, people like Vince Surf, who invented TCP/IP,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:23.200]   Paul Vixie, who invented bind, the DNS system, saying, "Hey, guys, look, we don't..."
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.720]   But I love Lamar Smith's responses.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.640]   But the Internet engineers say, "Guys, we invented this stuff.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.360]   This has been transformational.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.920]   And we think what you're doing is going to break it."
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.560]   And then Lamar Smith says, "Well, these guys all just want to make money.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.800]   That's all they can about is money."
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.200]   And that's the only reason that they don't like this bill.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.440]   And I just...
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.920]   So I'm going to be charitable and just say that people like Lamar Smith are clueless.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.360]   In fact, I think there's a lot of evidence.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.840]   They're far from clueless, but they just know where their bread is buttered.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.200]   I trust Vince Surf more than I trust those guys.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   Exactly.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.000]   Vince Surf made a penny every time somebody got online.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.400]   He would be fabulously wealthy as well.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.480]   He calls so unprecedented censorship of the web.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.960]   As far as I know, Vint is not fabulously wealthy.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.320]   He created something that we all use and he's trying to protect it.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.680]   I trust Vince Scully's technical acumen over those guys.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.520]   Well, and then Lamar Smith released an FAQ about why Vince Surf is wrong.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   So I clearly written, by the way, not by Lamar Smith, who probably doesn't have the words
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   to describe why Vince Surf is wrong.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.280]   But by a lobbyist from the recording industry, the mother's from the dictionary industry,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   and the television industry.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.720]   So, but here's the thing, and I think this is the important thing, is that's who's writing
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   the bills right now, right?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.320]   I mean, that's who wrote this bill.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.840]   But Congress can only act upon what we tell them and how we participate.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.320]   And I'm telling, what I'm worried about is, I'm worried about SOPA.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.720]   I don't think it's stupid, right?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.880]   I think Mucking with DNS is bad.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.960]   But I'm worried that we have, the internet has too long fostered an entire culture that
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.520]   believes it is apart from real life, right?
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.800]   And that the laws don't actually apply, right?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   And the laws of the United States, because they don't apply to bits, right?
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   Because once you turn it into bits and they fly around and speed a light, they can't get
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.320]   stopped for speeding, right?
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.000]   But that's not true.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.480]   And these people in Washington are, they're powerful, and they're moneyed, and they serve
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   moneyed interests.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.600]   So we don't participate at a real level and show them that we have interests and ideas
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.520]   about how to govern ourselves and our behavior in a responsible and rational way.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.480]   They will keep coming back with things like SOPA and PIPA, because that's all they're
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   being given.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.280]   So, so, so, so, all right.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.520]   So we need to give them an alternative.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   What is it, Niele?
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.520]   Man, I mean, I-
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.800]   There isn't one, but go ahead.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   What is it?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Well, I think there is.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   I know you think there is, but what is it?
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.160]   So, okay, so here's my big copyright law, what do you think, right?
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.640]   And I think the fundamental problem with copyright law is the exact thing that you keep talking
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   about.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.160]   It's that once you turn it into bits, you can copy it as much as you want, right?
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.400]   And that's stupid, right?
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.720]   We copyright law fundamentally regulates copies.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   It's right in the name.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.320]   It regulates the act of copies, because before bits making copies was hard, so it rate limited
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.520]   how you can make copies.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.160]   And you could find the people who are making the copies, because they had equipment to
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.840]   do it, and you could say, well, you have a copy machine.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.440]   We're taking it away from you.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.080]   Everybody has a copy machine now, a perfect copy machine.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.400]   And so we can't regulate copies anymore.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   That's foolish.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.840]   It doesn't, it doesn't even, it doesn't make sense to any teenager you ask, right?
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.920]   Hitting command D on your computer is regulated by law.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   That is stupid.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   What we need to regulate is access to content, because that's the real thing we're talking
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   about.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.000]   And if you, if you look at it, the market has already started to understand how to regulate
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   access to content.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.640]   And you hate DRM, and I hate DRM, but there are massively successful DRM systems in place
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.200]   right now that people love.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   Right?
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   They love Netflix.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Wait, Netflix is the same.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   There is no DRM that works.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Period.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   Netflix works.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   People don't complain about Netflix.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   Netflix is not DRM.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   It's not alarming.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.520]   But if you want to see any movie on Netflix, you can go to BitTorrent today and download
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   it.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   How does Netflix work?
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   People pay for it.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   They pay for it.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.040]   Oh, well, now see, I think you're conflating two ideas.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   That means, that doesn't mean Netflix is good DRM.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.920]   It means that people are willing to pay for content.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.560]   And that's my point of view is, I want you to show to me who's losing money because of
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   piracy.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.600]   Piracy provides copies of people who wouldn't buy them anyway.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.840]   There are plenty of us, in fact, I'd submit all of us who are willing to pay for content.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   We're not stupid.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.280]   We understand content doesn't happen.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.760]   Okay, I'll let you talk.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.080]   You're asking me how I would change copyright law.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.800]   And I would say the market is providing examples of ways people pay for content and what they
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.520]   don't want to pay for copies.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.040]   I don't think people think about copies anymore.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.120]   Even people who buy things from iTunes, right?
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.280]   They don't know that it's a copy and that it's regulated and what they can do with it
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.720]   has been regulated unless they pay for iTunes match and they gain an additional set of rights
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.440]   about what they can do with their copy.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.040]   That is bonkers, right?
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.240]   That is a legal fiction that no longer applies.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.760]   What people want to pay for is access to content.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.720]   So they pay for Netflix and they don't complain that Netflix is wrapped in DRM to the Hill.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   They pay for Spotify.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.080]   They don't complain that not Spotify music is wrapped in DRM to the Hill.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   Why?
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   Because they're just paying for access to content.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.320]   And that's what we should really be talking about.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.520]   We should be really talking about, well, I can pay Andy's friend who makes the movies
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.720]   for access to his DVD and then I have the right to just go and get it from wherever I
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.240]   want.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   I can't stop the LP.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.760]   Well, then I can rip it to a CD and I can download the MP3 from a torn side.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.960]   That makes sense to people.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   That's the common sense.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.280]   I think that there's a reason.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   One of the reasons there's a...
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.440]   It's a reading content from the copy.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.800]   One of the reasons there's a lot of piracy is because for a long time the companies that
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.520]   created this content did not make it available digitally.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.880]   So people who wanted it digitally went and got it.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.600]   And it's true that it's not an excuse.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   It's true.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.960]   It's point of access.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.000]   So my position is Netflix is not DRM.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.280]   I know it's DRM, but it's not about the DRM.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.760]   It's not about iTunes DRM.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.920]   It's about point of access.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   It's about that.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's easy and I can press a button and get it.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.880]   But the DRM, that's what I'm saying.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   We agree.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.840]   At this point we should be hugging each other.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.960]   I love you, man.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   But we agree.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.840]   You're saying, I'm just saying, I'm giving you the legal reality.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.640]   Make it easy is what you're saying.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.760]   Make it easy to get a legal copy.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.240]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   No, that's like the execution.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.560]   You're saying what people should do.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.120]   I'm saying at the legal level what our law should do.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Our law recognizes that what's important is access to content.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   Not copy.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   I get it.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   Right?
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.760]   And that's a huge disconnect in the law.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.560]   The law doesn't know that right now.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.360]   Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.600]   DRM is about preventing copying.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.920]   And then copyright law is about preventing copying.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.400]   And you and I are agreement on that.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.240]   This is what I was saying is that now we've gotten to the point where the technology means
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.960]   copying is trivial.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.320]   And no matter what you do to prevent copying, it will be circumvented because it's easy.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.160]   So we can't think that way.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.200]   We can't regulate copying because that horse has left the barn.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   So how do we regulate access?
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.040]   Well, I'm saying I think the market, these centralized DRM systems are the market response
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.800]   to regulating access, right?
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.040]   Subscription services are essentially a market response to what we know you're going to
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.240]   take everything.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   You want everything.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   What's pay us some rate?
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.400]   You know, ultraviolet is coming out.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.800]   And if you are familiar with it, it's the new centralized DRM system from Hollywood,
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   right?
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.200]   Where you buy the Blu-ray and then you get a digital copy from Flixter.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.000]   And then that DRM is centralized.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.240]   You can go to different services.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.760]   At least that's a big plan.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.160]   And that's Hollywood solution to this problem is saying, well, fine, we know that you want
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.480]   to use whatever service you want.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.880]   We just want you to pay us, please, for the love of God pay us.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.600]   And that's what Louis CK did.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   Louis CK put a little note that said, I know you could torrent this.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.720]   You probably will, but if you like this content and you want me to make more of it, pay me
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.800]   five bucks.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   And guess what?
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   He did very, very well.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.960]   But he's a, he's like a sympathetic human being who connects.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.440]   So my submission would be that maybe people who create content need to start becoming real
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   people.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.560]   They need to start treating their audience as a community.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.000]   They need to say, look, you know, this works.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.880]   The problem is you can't take the old business model and shoehorn it into the internet world.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   I agree with you.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   Right.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.720]   So what we need to do is instead of thinking of ways to force people to accept the old
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.240]   way of doing things, which is what all of this is about, we need to start recognizing
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.640]   the world's changed and a person like Jonathan Colton or Louis CK or Twitt, we can all do
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:41.720]   just fine if we start acknowledging our users, not as thieves, because that's what all DRM
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.600]   assumes is your thief.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.480]   So I'm just going to make sure I lock this down because you will steal it if I don't.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   Instead of treating our consumers that way, we say your community, we're peers, we're
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.000]   sharing, you support us, we support you.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.160]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   That sounds utopian.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.000]   Sounds like a good world.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   Listen, let's not ignore the fact that Louis CK already had probably one of the hottest
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.640]   TV shows on cable TV through that marketing issue.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   That's already already.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.960]   No, no, no, no, I'm saying that it's a, it's a significant data point that he was so successful
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.680]   by releasing his video himself and also without DRM.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   But he already had a pretty big cannon to fire that video out of.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.840]   And it's not necessarily true that an unknown comedian could have exact, have anywhere near
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.640]   the same level of success, not making a million dollars, but making, let's say, his money
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.840]   back plus 20%.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.400]   This is why- >> That's not your name.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.240]   There's nothing to do with copyrighted DRM.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.800]   That's- >> Well, you're saying before about how
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.960]   the old model is broken, this new model is going to work great.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   It's going to work great.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.760]   Great for everybody.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.520]   If you don't have the kind of national name, you may believe that I want to create a book
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.920]   any opening pub format so that anybody can copy it.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.320]   >> Scott Sigler was unheard of.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.200]   Corey Doctorow was unheard of.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.400]   Jonathan Colton was unheard of.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.840]   I don't think you have to be a television celebrity to make a living anymore.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.040]   >> And if you're, if nobody knows who you are, then nobody will care enough to pirate
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   you.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.840]   >> I'm asking if point two.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.120]   >> There's a balance.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.360]   I think we have to respect the rights of the people who just want to sell out and make
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   a lot of money.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   >> Well, I respect their rights.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.520]   I don't think they're going to make it anymore.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.200]   I don't think you're going to see another Metallica.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   And if it is, it will be by performance only.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   It will not be because they sold a billion records because DRM doesn't-
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.360]   >> It does not matter, I mean, a band like Metallica maybe, you know, tastes have changed,
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.000]   but Kanye West exists, you know, JZ exists, React exists.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   >> Right.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   >> Right.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.520]   >> So I guess you could still make money in an Internet world without shutting down the
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   Internet.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.680]   >> Well, yeah, I don't think anybody's making that argument.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.640]   I don't think- >> Well, it sounds like the argument,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.400]   like, oh my God, I can't make a living because they're going to rob me blind.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.760]   It's like a shopkeeper deciding, hey, I can't open a store because everybody's going to
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   come in and take everything.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.240]   >> No, let me- >> I mean, I'm not to argue, this one's saying we don't write the laws.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.000]   We're not participating enough to solve the problems constructively.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   >> Well, I agree with that.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   We got a participant.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.800]   >> If you were Universal's general counsel, how do you solve mega upload?
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.000]   What is your solution?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.480]   Because it is a problem for your company.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   >> That's not my problem.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.440]   >> My company is beholden to- >> Thank God, it's not my problem.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   >> But that's why I'm not general counsel at UNG.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.200]   And I presume why you're not general counsel at UNG.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   >> Now, there's a time in my life when I wanted to be-
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.160]   >> Yeah, well, would you want to now?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   >> No.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   >> No.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   >> It'd be a little hard.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.320]   But I went to law school because I grew up in the age of Napster and I said, well, this
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.040]   is broken and I want to learn about it.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.080]   And then I was like, man, this being lawyer sucks.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.600]   I'd rather write about the law, not actually after practice.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.920]   And I admire that, Neil.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:45.480]   And I think it's people like you who have a foot in both camps can make some headway.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.920]   I just think it would be foolish to not recognize the fact that the technology is here and any
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.360]   attempt to roll back, which is what SOPA is, by the way, any attempt to roll back the
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.040]   technology is doomed and should be doomed.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   >> And I agree.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.360]   And I don't think there's any disagreement there.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   I'm saying what worries me about the opposition is that Google and Twitter, they have to start
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   participating, right?
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.040]   I mean, if our system is broken, so be it.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.840]   If Lamar Smith is getting paid by Hollywood, so be it.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.160]   Google and Twitter have to find people to pay on their own and protect our interests
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.680]   on their own because that's how the game is played.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.760]   >> Well, isn't all that money- >> Leave it alone.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.000]   I mean, that's not how the world works.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.200]   >> Isn't all that money really about getting votes?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.280]   And don't we in fact control the actual resource, the votes?
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.320]   If 82,000 people respond to a Tumblr campaign on Stop Internet Censorship Day and call their
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.360]   member of Congress, don't you think those members of Congress listen to those 82,000
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   voters?
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   I hope so.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.280]   I mean, what else are you going to use that money for?
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.200]   >> I think that's pretty idealistic.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.080]   And I worry that the internet is fundamentally, as a community, the companies and the people
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.040]   who make up our culture are fundamentally naive and idealistic about how politics works.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.440]   And because they, that's how we think.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.040]   We think, well, bits are unregulated, everything's free, there's free speech, the internet will
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.200]   solve everybody, and in Somalia and iPod, it'll be great, right?
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   It doesn't work.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.080]   That's not the real world.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:15.240]   >> Actually, I am a utopian and I do believe that we will win even if Lamar Smith wins
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.560]   this battle in the long run.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:25.000]   He and his ilk are doomed as his UMG and every other Hollywood content company who thinks
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.920]   that they can block computing and the internet with all their millions and billions and
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   win.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   They will not win in the long run.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   >> I'm going to win in the short run.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.840]   I have a feeling that they're not going to win in the long run.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   >> We've talked about this for a long time and I don't want to dominate the show with
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.960]   my rambling, but I will say this, I agree with you.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.160]   We'll win the war.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.760]   I think we need to make sure it's not a war of attrition because we might win this battle,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   but they will come back.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   >> Oh, I know.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   >> And once we have something realistic and constructive to offer as a counter that is
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.280]   a compromise, a real compromise respects their rights and our rights and our vision.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   >> Right.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.920]   >> That we will never actually succeed.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.920]   And besides you, is Larry Lessig, is somebody out there actively promoting a compromise?
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.400]   >> There's lots of people.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.680]   >> I don't think EFF is.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.920]   I don't see Larry doing it.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.560]   >> Well, Larry quit this battle.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.680]   He's on the corruption and money in general, right?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   >> Right.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.760]   >> Because I think he got frustrated by not being able to win this battle.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.440]   The EFF is, I keep saying it, I've been a card-carrying member of the EFF since I was
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   14 or something.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.880]   And they've been inspirational to me forever, but they're also a lobbying organization.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.480]   And they lobbied.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.040]   And I think that means sometimes they take extreme positions, the detriment of actual
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   consensus.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.560]   But that's their role, that's their job.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.040]   And I'm on the lookout for people who want to make real changes.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.120]   I see them and I try to give them as much time on the verge and appearances like this
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   as I can.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.240]   But right now the battle is maximalist.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.760]   It's either you love it or you think you hate it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   That's wrong.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   I don't think that's how you accomplish anything.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   >> Well, even Larry.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.440]   >> Larry, that makes me an extremely boring person.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.680]   >> Yeah, compromise is not interesting.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.600]   Even Larry, when he was fighting the copyright fight, said stop pirating, start changing
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   the laws.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   And promise, it's- >> And Larry, in his book, the first
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.640]   person he thanks in his book is Jack Valenti, who was the president of the NBA.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   >> Is that funny?
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.480]   >> But he says, he was a great teacher to me.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.680]   He made me understand the other side of the argument, which is that's the key.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.600]   Because if you don't, then you will never offer a compromise.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.160]   >> It's totally true, by the way, that SOPA is really not going to do that much to prevent
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.640]   serious people who went to seriously pirate stuff from doing so.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   They'll figure out a way.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   >> None of this stuff ever does.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.440]   >> It may not be- >> It may not be why we don't learn that
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.440]   lesson.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   >> It'll be a hassle for the rest of us, unfortunately.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.200]   And I've been in China.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.480]   You can't get to my site, technologyizer in China because I'm on WordPress.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.360]   And WordPress is entirely blocked because they won't work with the Chinese government.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   >> And that's the SOPA style solution.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   >> But- >> But- >> Kill the domain.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.560]   >> But whenever I go to China, I run into lots of people who are reading my stuff.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.800]   And that's because when you're in China, you know how to get to the sites you want to,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.400]   even if it's a little bit more difficult.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.040]   And I feel like pirates here will know how to get around SOPA.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.920]   >> There's actually, I think a deeper story about that in China, which is that the elites
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.160]   know how to get around it.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   >> Yes, they do.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.680]   >> And they actually don't mind if the intellectuals and everybody knows how to get around it.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.360]   The government doesn't actively try to stop that.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.760]   That's not, in fact, they understand how important it is that the elites be exposed to Western
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.680]   ideas because that's where innovation comes from.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.080]   So they're not willing, in fact, to shut the internet down.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.200]   It's just for the masses.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.400]   They're more worried about the masses uprising in China than anything else.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   >> The firewall is an inconvenience rather than a true barrier.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.440]   >> And it's not, it's not true for SOPA, too.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.360]   >> Yeah, I guess we would know how to get around it.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:44.480]   If you want to do something about this, folks, Americancensorship.org, I think the biggest
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:50.160]   enemy here is indifference.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.920]   Speaking out and acting is the most important thing to do.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   And this is a fight that is not going to be over with SOPA.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   It will continue.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.960]   And if you've got a better solution, let's hear it.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.800]   I don't think one exists, but if you've got one, I'd love to hear it.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.920]   Because I agree, if we could come up with, well, I agree with you, Nili.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.200]   If we could appease these idiots with something that worked, they'd go away.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.160]   I don't think they're, I don't think we're ever going to appease these idiots.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   They want it.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.440]   They really want to roll back the clock.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   It's really what they want.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   >> But so, but I don't think they want to.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.840]   >> I don't think they put yourself in their shoes.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   I mean, they are saying the same thing about you.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.960]   If we could just appease these idiots with some solution, it still protects our content.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   They would finally shut up.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.160]   >> So both of us are trying to figure it out.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.640]   And the other of us have come up with a solution.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.160]   >> But you are the ones who have not provided any alternative legislation.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.080]   That's the problem, right?
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.360]   Where's Google's lobby is saying?
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   Here's real legislation on copyright infringement.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.600]   Where's Twitter's lobby is saying?
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   >> They're not doing it.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.440]   And that's a huge problem.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   Okay.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.160]   I don't buy the fundamental presumption that piracy is a problem.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.080]   >> Well, it's, again, you don't like being stolen from, but you don't cement over your
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   front door.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   >> Right.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.740]   >> So I think that there needs to be a, I do think there needs to be a balance between
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:09.240]   acknowledging that almost any technological solution to piracy is not going to work against
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.880]   not going to work towards our interests.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.580]   But at the same time, let's not let that slide into the idea that piracy is okay and that
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.200]   piracy never hurts anybody.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.680]   >> Well, I would just admit that you're going to have to accept that there is a certain
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.880]   amount of, of, of usage of pilfrich.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.600]   And as, as all every store does, they say, well, there's a certain percentage of pilfrich.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.160]   We're going to live with that because the opposite choice is to be a completely unappealing
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   place to shop.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   >> And we're not going to do that.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.800]   And I think we have to find business models that work in the modern world.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.600]   Instead of saying, let's go back to 1952.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.520]   >> I don't think the industry wants to roll back the clock.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.440]   I think they want to remake, they like modern, the modern world just the way it is, because
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.720]   there's more room for profits.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.320]   I think they want to make it in a world that's most beneficial specifically to their industry.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.880]   And if they can spread a few smolians around in Congress and simply say, what if we turn
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.680]   every single IP address into a pipeline that puts money directly in our pockets and they'll
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   have to do that?
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   >> They would do it.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   I mean, >> You would do it if they could.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   >> Yeah, this has to be stopped.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   >> All right.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   Well, I have to make some money if you guys don't mind.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   So let's take a break.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   We're going to come back.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.000]   I want to talk about mega upload.com because this is, if you thought that was heated, you
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.200]   >> I think that's going to be a lot faster.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   We're on the same side.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.240]   >> No, I don't think it'll be heated among us.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.560]   We're just going to all yell at them.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.520]   >> They lie Patel is here from the Verge.com, a really brilliant fellow and always good to
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:42.920]   have him on Harry McCrackett from the Technologizer, not only brilliant, but often in the Technologizer,
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.720]   I think beautifully written thought pieces about what's going on.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.280]   So it's a must read in terms of keeping up, but also in terms of thinking and I like that.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.440]   And of course, Andy Inako, who has just got great sideburns.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   And now.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:02.040]   >> God, you're dizzing me with all those top notes outside the old.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.720]   >> Harry's techno technological insights.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.640]   Andy writes for the Chicago Sun times, do I need to say anymore?
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.160]   He's actually a real journalist.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.920]   So see, that's how those guys think.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.760]   >> It's not on dead trees.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   It's not real.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.000]   >> What about the soy industry for God's sake?
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Think about the children.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   You don't care about newspapers.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.760]   Think about the soybean industry.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.520]   >> Who's going to make the ink?
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.480]   >> All right, go to meeting, Fens.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.760]   It's time for Leo to pay the bills.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   And this is a sponsored bill for a long time.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.760]   We love the folks at Citrix.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   They make great products.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.480]   And this is one of the things we tell our advertisers that I think is different in the
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   modern world.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.560]   If you are going to work in this environment, you need to appeal to people's intelligence.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.040]   You need to tell them about features and benefits.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.720]   And you need to give them a trial offer.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   And this is what they do.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   And I love this.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   Meeting is the online meeting service that we talk about all the time.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.560]   Very handy around this time of year, because I don't know about you, but I'm gone about
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.080]   two weeks this month.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.520]   If you can't meet online, you're going to have a trouble meeting this time of year.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.480]   Go to meeting by Citrix is amazing.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.320]   So first of all, it works on a Mac or PC.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.880]   You'll put it on a desktop computer to start a meeting.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.040]   Makes it very easy.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.400]   Point and click.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.720]   Emails are sent out with links.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.840]   Makes it very easy for anybody to attend the meeting, even if they'd have never heard of
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.240]   go to meeting before, they just click the link, say yes, and they're in the meeting.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.600]   They get full audio and video over the internet or there's a conference call bridge if they
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.880]   want to use that.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.920]   And here's the sweet thing that they've just added.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.040]   It now works not only on iPads.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.360]   There's a free iPad app.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.800]   iPhones and Android mobile devices as well.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:51.120]   So literally you can attend a meeting, a go to meet meeting on your Android device with
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   a free app.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   Now that is super slick.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.480]   That means somebody in transit, somebody in the airport, somebody at home sick, can
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.400]   be there, can participate.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.680]   And if you're using HD faces, they're video conferencing, they'll see you and it looks
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   fantastic.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:08.760]   High def, crystal clear video, screen sharing, state of the art technology.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.320]   So those are the features and benefits.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   Great for training, great for product demos, pitches, weekly updates, that kind of thing.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.440]   All right from your desk and you can try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   And this is the pitch.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.800]   Now I don't ask you for money.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.600]   I'm just going to ask you to try it free.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:32.840]   Visit go to meeting.com, click the try it free button and the promo code is TWIT.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.160]   Go to meeting.com, try it free button promo code, TWIT.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.160]   Give it a try today.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.360]   I think you're going to be very impressed.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   Go to meeting.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.200]   That's what we use for all of our online meetings.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.520]   Let's talk about mega upload.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.920]   Now I want to set the stage for this.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.480]   I know you're up to speed on this knee line because you've talked with Tom Merritt about
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:55.000]   it.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.920]   Mega upload is an upload service that is used for a variety of things including let's say
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.400]   yes, absolutely piracy, right?
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   It's not a very good piracy tool but you could use it for piracy.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.280]   I mean there are better ways if you want to share files in mega upload.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:17.920]   They had a video made that featured some big name stars including Will I Am and others
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   from the Universal Music Group.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.680]   That video was Kim Kardashian.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.640]   Kanye was in it.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.600]   Keep scrolling it's down at the bottom of that.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.760]   Is it at the bottom here?
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   Should I?
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Alicia Keys.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   Alicia Keys.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   We'll play a little bit of it.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.320]   This is guaranteed that we will get pulled down from YouTube.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.800]   It's just a promo, right?
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.320]   It's an ad.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.920]   It's an ad for Mega upload and they got some big names to do it.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.560]   Now some of these people were UMG, Universal Music Group stars.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.280]   They all gave their permission.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.960]   No, so we think.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   We don't know.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.680]   Well there's some gray areas here.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   Well I am.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   He didn't.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   His lawyers said he didn't.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   Then he said he did.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.440]   So that's the problem is there's his lawyers thought that he didn't and he did.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.960]   Somebody who was on the video asked to have it be taken down, right?
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:17.200]   So it's on YouTube right now, by the way, uploaded by mr.Kim.com.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.800]   And this is part of the problem is somebody else is going to always upload this.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.600]   Mr. Kim got one and a half million hits.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.880]   Kim.com that's the guy.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.880]   That's the guy.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   Oh he is.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.000]   Okay so this is now currently up.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Yes.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.040]   YouTube decided that it should go back up.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:39.160]   So UMG took it down and then there was an appeal.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.680]   UMG is kind of weird because we thought it was a DMC takedown and then at one point,
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.160]   UMG's lawyers said, oh no, we have a side agreement.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.160]   Yep.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.560]   We have a side agreement with YouTube that says we could take anything down we want.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.160]   Because the dispute is do you in fact own the rights to this?
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.800]   Now I understand this and that's a legitimate dispute.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   This is where it starts to irk me a little bit and I'm sure you too, Nielei.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.280]   Tom Merritt and Tech News today, our news show, our daily news show, as we have just
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.400]   done covered in the story and played a clip.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:19.280]   UMG pulled Tech News today down just for reporting on the controversy.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.480]   Now we've had this problem time and time again.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:27.880]   Almost every time I play a clip, whatever show I play the clip on gets pulled off YouTube.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.280]   We appeal it.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.280]   Sometimes it gets back up.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Sometimes not.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.400]   Actually, let me ask you Nielei.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.560]   Our defense and I know it's a good defense is that we're using it for commentary.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   It's a news show.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   It's fair use.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.920]   But that's a defense, right?
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   It's not.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   I don't understand.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.760]   So do you want the law school explanation?
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   So I'll do it.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   I'll try to be fast.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   Okay.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   Section 10817.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   Mr. Patel.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:01.200]   17 USC 106 says you're the exclusive rights that you own as a copyright owner and you know,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   you're going to do it.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   And then you're going to do it.

[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   And then you're going to do it.

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   And then you're going to do it.

[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   And then you're going to do it.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   It's kind of crazy because we think of YouTube as being part of the web and being open and free.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   And it's there and it's so basic.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   But it's not.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   YouTube is run by Google, which is a huge company that has lawyers.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   And they want music videos and stuff from Universal on YouTube.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   So they make deals.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   They make deals about what you and I probably think of as just part of the web.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   It's a free thing that exists.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   And one of those deals was Universal has access to YouTube's CMS.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   So they acted outside the law.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   Right?
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   They said, well, we're just taking it down.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   You mean, wait a minute.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   I mean, they could push a button.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   They don't have to go to Google.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   They just do it.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   They apparently have direct access.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   And it appears that direct access is so they can push people onto Vivo, which is the music
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   service partnership.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   So they can go and find the other music videos on YouTube.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   But they didn't push us to Vivo.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   They pushed us under water and held our heads there for 10 days.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   Right.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   And you know, it's funny is that, you know, it's an insane situation where, you know,
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   there's really no legal recourse there for mega uploader for you.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   Right.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   You who are you going to sue?
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   They have a private agreement that says they can do this.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   And that it happened outside of the DMCA, right, where you get to appeal and they actually
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   have to sue you and you can sue them for abusing the DMCA.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   There is there is there is some recourse there.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   Right.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   I mean, I can get I can get.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   If they did it using damages, right?
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   But if they did it using the mechanism of the DMCA, which is what you want, right?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   You want there to be.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   Right.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   This is what I'm saying about copyright law, right?
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.200]   You have to, unless we provide a framework, we can't, you don't get to collect damages
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   for people abusing the framework.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   And here they're acting outside of the framework that exists.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   They're saying we have a deal with YouTube.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   We can do whatever we want on YouTube.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   We hit the lead.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   You went away.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   And that's kind of insane.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   Right.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   I mean, that's that's insane on many levels, right?
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   The universal shouldn't have access to news reporting on YouTube.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   They should be bound by the law of the United States, right?
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   Which says news reporting commentary is legal fair use, black and white.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   But they're not because they have like a side deal.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.200]   And so if we start ignoring, pervasively ignoring copyright law, pervasively ignoring the fact
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   that the government is ostensibly our government and we are our responsibility to shape it,
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   we will then be governed by side deals that we have no recourse to fixing.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   Well, I mean, the point is the point you made originally.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   That's emblematic of a much bigger problem.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   Right.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   It's universal can go to YouTube and we need YouTube.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.200]   Right.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   Well, but the point you made originally is that YouTube, and this is an important point,
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   is a private entity.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   They're not the internet.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   They're just, they're a private entity.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   But what is the internet but a collection of private entities?
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   There's no government.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   But really, I mean, I should just be able to go to a different private entity that doesn't
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   have the side deal.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.200]   Well, why not?
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   By all means.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   In fact, we host the truth is we do.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   We host our own videos.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   But not everybody has that.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   Not everybody has that.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   No.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   Your infrastructure, right?
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   Your infrastructure costs money.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   And you know, you had to tell us about go to meeting in order to pay for that infrastructure.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   Some kid at home talking about Megapolo doesn't have those resources.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   So does YouTube have a higher duty then?
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   You know, but they do under copyright law.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   This is why the DMCA is functional.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   That's why some people are okay with it.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   Like, you know, I think it can be better, but it's functional because if you operate under
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   the mechanism of the DMC, some safe harbor, they can file the takedown.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   You can file the opposition.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   It comes back onto YouTube.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   Everything, you know, it's not perfect, but at least it's a system.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   I agree.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   Decide for it.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   You know, there's no system and there doesn't have to be a system.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   So it's like it's fun.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   The whole Megapolo story is ridiculous and on every level, right?
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   But it's this one little slice that explains like everything that's wrong.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   It's all in here.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   It's all it's all packed in.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   Well, it was a revelation to me to know that there are companies like Universal Music
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   that have a kill switch for any video on YouTube they want to kill for whatever reason.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   In this case, they have no legitimate reason.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   It's censorship.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   They didn't want the conversation to happen.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   I'm glad it happened because now we know.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   Yeah, it was dumb of them, wasn't it?
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   I mean, this goes to it really speaks to, I think, two things.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   One, how important YouTube is.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   And I think we give it very little credit, right?
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   No, it's huge.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   It is the dominant.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   I mean, if you got pulled off of the MEO, we wouldn't be talking about that.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   We'd be annoying and we'd fix it.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   YouTube is like, what?
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   What?
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   That's not cool.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   And the second thing is that the money talks, right?
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   The money talked to Google here and they were coerced into making this deal and giving
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   the universe this access so they could get the thing that they wanted, which was the
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   high quality, high, you know, super expensive, high end premium content music videos that
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   drive people to YouTube.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   And that, like, you can't discount that.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   People love those.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   Somebody in our chat room.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Somebody in chat named Soppa for life said it's not censorship.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   YouTube's a private entity.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   Now, this is not censorship in that.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   It's not censorship.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:34.700]   But if YouTube wants safe harbor, so they either can be treated as a private entity or as
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.700]   a carrier.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.200]   They can't be both.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:43.800]   Aren't they, aren't they in effect saying, well, we want to be protected by the safe harbor
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.900]   provision and they want their cake and they want to eat it too.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.900]   Is that not the case?
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.900]   Right.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.200]   But who would sue them for that, right?
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   It's universal.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   Right.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.800]   The after to take them down and be happy.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   Right.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   So they're happy, right?
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.200]   Because they get what they want and Google still gets to say, well, you know, it's what's
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   230 section.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.400]   I'm getting into session numbers.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   That's all right.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.200]   But it says you're a safe harbor.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.880]   And, you know, as a service provider, you're not responsible for what users upload under
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   your service as long as you don't exert, like editorial control over it.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.960]   But here they clearly are by deleting something.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   Right.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.440]   So it's just really tricky balance.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.640]   There's been a lot of cases around 230.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.080]   But you know, the people who bring the cases are companies like universal.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.520]   So if universal is happy, then the law doesn't get, the boundaries of the law don't get refined
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.080]   over time because there's no more cases to refine it.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.440]   So in that's what I'm saying is it's we have to be active, right?
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.880]   We have to understand what the legal system is trying to do to our precious, precious
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   internet.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.600]   And we have to be the ones in charge of it.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.120]   Because if we're not, then just bad things happen left and right.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.600]   It sounds pretty intractable.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   I'm quitting.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.840]   I'm starting a lobbyist organization.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.120]   I swear to God.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:56.800]   But this whole thing is an example of why SOPA is a bad idea because this is the kind
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.560]   of thing I think that these commercial entities are going to perpetrate.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   Basically, they're going to go around pulling up down anything they don't like.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.160]   And they may and it may not be individual videos anymore.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.440]   It may be entire domains like maybe that twit.tv.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.320]   It sounds like a commie front.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.080]   You know, you're in the United States.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.280]   They couldn't do that to you.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.080]   So, but doesn't give them the power to you.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.800]   You'd have to be hosted somewhere outside of the boundaries of the United States.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.640]   Yeah, because wogs don't get any rights.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.720]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.200]   Those ferners, the hell with them.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.000]   The internet was good enough for Jesus Christ.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.560]   It'd be good enough for us.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   That's an on-screen.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.560]   Where that came from?
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   It's an old joke.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.880]   It's just took a long, that took a long, a dark turn on a long hallway.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.000]   It's an old joke.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.080]   It was actually, I believe it actually happened in Congress many years ago when they were debating
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.320]   English as a national language when some, some congressmen stood up saying, "Well, if
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.440]   English was good enough for Jesus, it ought to be good enough for everybody else."
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   That's what I say.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   I like, I like the whole language.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   Yeah, recognizes fog horn, like horn.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.520]   Now, all of your congressional people impressions so far have all been.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.080]   Well, I'm just doing it in a clag horn.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.840]   That's all I'm doing.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.920]   I do think, I don't know.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   I have, someday I would like to meet Lamostometh.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:18.200]   So it is a pleasure and a privilege, I say a privilege to meet you.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.920]   I'm just curious what he, he probably doesn't sound like.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   He's probably very distinguished.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   Where's a suit?
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:27.640]   Doesn't wear a white hat, have a little goatee and a string tie, I'm sure.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   But Iotta.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:33.760]   All right, so, okay, I think we've talked about this enough.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   Poor Harry.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   Let's move on.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Yeah, let's talk about something.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   Talk about something.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.800]   Let's talk about phones.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:45.520]   Galaxy Nexus, we got another debate going because I don't like this thing.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.120]   And I know I'm the only one in the world who doesn't like this Galaxy Nexus.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.680]   What were you using before the Galaxy Nexus?
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.520]   The Samsung, well, I split my time between an iPhone 4S.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.600]   I have to say, you know, when the 4S came, I wasn't an Android user until a 4S.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.760]   Well, it's a long story.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.000]   I've gone back and forth.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.840]   But I was using the Galaxy S2, which I really like a lot.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.280]   And this, I don't know, Nila, Joshua liked it, I think.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.680]   Yeah, he liked it.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   I like it.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.680]   I think.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.680]   So expensive.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   In New York, there are so many of them now.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.000]   It's like, we took a picture of the staff and we, it was like 13 of them or something
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   really ridiculous.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.440]   But you guys don't have to pay for them.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.520]   No, our guys, a bunch of our guys went on.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.520]   They bought them?
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.520]   All right.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.520]   I think Josh is the only one if there are these in it.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.360]   And I have to say, being in Manhattan, you have Verizon 4G and that is a big selling
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   point on these.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   That's the main thing.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.360]   Like a lot of it.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   So that's not.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   I don't like it.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.320]   What are you looking?
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.960]   My biggest complaint, there's some things are great.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   The camera is great.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   The new calendar app, the new Gmail app, there's a lot of the apps are fantastic.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.200]   But I don't like the soft buttons.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.600]   I think it's really a bad user interface model to have things jump around, move around,
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   be unpredictable.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.240]   They've moved the search button up to the top.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.920]   I like to have it always available at all times.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   It is not.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.240]   It is only if you have a special Google ad at the top of your screen, which I don't
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   like.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.840]   You know, I always take off that Google search widget, but now that's the only way you get
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.000]   the search button is by having that Google search widget.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.320]   And that's on top of every page.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.920]   It eats up some real estate.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.160]   These buttons are no longer hard buttons that they used to be at the bottom.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.440]   And admittedly, the carriers screwed it up by moving them around all the time.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:24.400]   But having four buttons back, home, menu, and search, whatever the order is great.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.560]   There's no longer search button.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.160]   There's no longer a menu button.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.320]   This button, which shows you recently opened apps is ugly and useless.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.560]   So the home button and the back button.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   You know, where's the menu button?
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   Show me the menu button.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   There is no one.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   I hated the menu button.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.560]   What?
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   Yes.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.880]   Well, how could you hate a menu button?
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   In principle, it's a good idea.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   But the problem is that it makes application designers lazy because they tended to stuff
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   stuff in there.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.440]   You really never knew what would be stuffed in the menu button.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.320]   It varied from application to application.
[00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:00.800]   And the fact that iOS doesn't give you that forced developers to create better interfaces
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.040]   where you could find stuff.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.440]   And also, the back button does not behave the same way in every application.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.840]   I really feel that if Google could start all over again and do a UI with no buttons,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.840]   we'd be better off.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   Really?
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   They didn't do that.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   I like the back button.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.240]   I think the back button is the single biggest selling point over iOS.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.560]   Every time I-- because the only way you go back in iOS is you have to go right back to
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.800]   the front-- you have to go all the way back.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.960]   Every browser in the world has a back button.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.880]   What if every browser only had a home button?
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   That makes no sense.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   But browser back buttons work predictably.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   Well, they work predictably.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   That's the answer.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   That's the previous page.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.640]   A back button can mean go to the previous thing you were looking at.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.800]   It can mean undo the last thing you just did.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.640]   It can mean cancel the thing you're looking at right now.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.360]   And in every single laugh, they have their own different interpretation of what it should
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   do.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   It's a work consistent.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   It would be OK.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.000]   But the fact that I have no idea what that undo button is going to do, moreover, now that
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.920]   it's a soft button, it's really easy if I'm just sort of fumbling with my phone a little
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.840]   bit to accidentally tap that back button and say, oh, that's a big problem.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.440]   I guess you didn't want those three paragraphs of text that you just pasted in.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.440]   Actually, I did.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.120]   And now they're gone forever because I had a mini grip on my phone.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.480]   Well, that's why I would like these to be physical.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.200]   I would like them to be consistent.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.640]   And I happen to like the back button.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   But if you don't like it, don't use it.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.080]   It's him sandwich is the first.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.440]   I mean, you don't have to use it.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.080]   Nobody's making you use the back button.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   You can't use it.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   You're correct.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.680]   Except you sort of do need to because applications are designed for you.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   Yeah, they are.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   You can't not use it, I guess.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.160]   It's interesting how much of a matter of personal preference it is because I can stand which
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.120]   is the first version of Android that you like.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.360]   I don't want to eventually throw the phone through the window out of frustration.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.560]   And that's interesting because I like I love gingerbread.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.200]   So one thing that I have to step back a little bit, I didn't like the Pentile display.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:51.440]   And I think that was because the settings that Samsung put in here for auto screen brightness
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.880]   were way too aggressive.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.040]   They're way too low.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.760]   And at low brightness is the Pentile display is truly crap.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.320]   But if you turn it all the way up, this display looks great.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.960]   Of course, battery life is about an hour and a half.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   On a 4G phone, you have nothing but battery life.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.440]   Yeah, but don't, isn't that look beautiful now?
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.200]   It really looks good.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:12.520]   You don't see the pixelation that you see on the lower brightnesses.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.120]   So I will stand corrected on that.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   You don't get the color noise.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.120]   You don't.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   I do get the color noise and I hate it.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.760]   But when it's all the way up, you don't get it as much.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.760]   Here you get.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   I'm trying to be overexposed.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   Right.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   Because it's exactly right.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.160]   So Pentile has color noise and that bugs me.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.640]   But apparently not everybody sees it because I pointed it out.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.360]   Everybody said, well, it looks good to me.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   I knew you.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   People don't see it.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   I pointed out and I reviewed the Droid Razer which has a much lower resolution.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   It's also a Pintile.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.840]   And that is like the worst display I've ever seen.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.640]   I put it in the review and people freaked out at me.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.600]   They're like, you've got microscopic eyes.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.080]   I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.200]   Like a regular pretty, actually pretty bad eyes and I can see it.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.160]   It's it's it's a known, you know, issue with Pentile displays.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.280]   And this is a Pentile display.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.880]   I like the high resolution.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.400]   And if you blow it out, you don't see it.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.400]   So that's what I'm going to do.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.800]   I'm just going to have it blown out all the time.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.400]   Have you seen the HTC Resound which has a regular LCD 7.5-C display?
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.880]   No, it looks like a nice.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880]   That's like beautiful.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.040]   You know, phones like twice a stick, of course, but it's beautiful display.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   This is nice and thin.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   This is even this is the GSM.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.520]   So it's even thinner than the one you've seen the LTE.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.520]   The LTE is pretty thick.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   It's a lot thick.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   I have seen it.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   It's heavier too.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Yeah, just a little bit.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.800]   I mean, hey, every ounce counts, my friend, when you're when you're when you're only way
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.880]   in five and a half ounces, one more makes a difference.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   That's 20%.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.720]   I mean, I think I honestly think I know you obviously are fanning, but I think it is the
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.200]   only Android phone that anybody should consider.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.280]   And if you don't want to get Verizon and deal with a slightly reduced battery life and,
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.480]   you know, paying their, paying their data rates, you can get the unlock version.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   You can take it.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   That's what I've got here.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480]   That's what I'm using.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   Or do AT&T its pentavan.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.720]   I mean, I don't think anybody should buy another Android phone.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720]   Really?
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.440]   I think if you're Verizon, probably you're right.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.840]   There's no better phone on Verizon.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.080]   But if you're not Verizon, I love the Galaxy S2.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.760]   And this is almost identical.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   It's just a lower.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.640]   You know what the Galaxy S2 is?
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.200]   It's 800 by 480.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   That's green.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   It's the screen resolution.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.320]   And ice cream crappy sandwich, right?
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.080]   Ice crap sandwich, whatever that I see a stance.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:11.080]   You know, we already saw the build of Samsung's touch whiz on like leech ROM.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   Oh dear.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.080]   It's on top.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   Ice cream sandwich.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.080]   Is it awful?
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.080]   It's depressing.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.760]   You know, it's it's the aesthetics are so different.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   You know, ice cream sandwich.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.080]   I think it looks beautiful.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.560]   I mean, maybe the functionality is a little uneven in places, but I think it looks beautiful.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.440]   And touch whiz looks so bad.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.600]   So to see them strip away all of ice cream sandwich for like the cartoon icons is just
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   deeply, deeply depressing.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   Samsung loves colored icons, colored menus.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   They do love that.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600]   I actually like touch whiz.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.520]   But I understand why you don't like it.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.840]   It is pretty much aesthetically.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   This is the thing.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   Do you like this?
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.720]   This task menu where you have all these windows?
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.560]   These are all the things that I've been doing.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560]   Like I don't.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.000]   You shouldn't be doing this.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.400]   This multitasking bad idea anyway, right?
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.760]   None of this stuff is running really.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.240]   Well, it works.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.200]   It works great as a.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.520]   It works great as a recently used application launcher.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.760]   I think that putting up putting icons in the desktop is not as useful as simply maintaining
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.640]   a list of things you've recently launched.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   I do like that.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.600]   If that were available, if that were checkbox on the iPhone, I would definitely be using
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   it.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.000]   But I think I do think that ice cream sandwich is an improvement.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.880]   But it reminds me that Android is like the Remington house where it doesn't look like
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.440]   they've.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.640]   There is a couple of people who sat down and figured out what this phone should do and
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.000]   how it should behave.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.280]   It's just room after room after room where one experience is going to be different from
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   the other.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.040]   A text input that works OK in one app works completely wrong on the other app.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.800]   A button that you think you know what it's going to do when you push it in the on the
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.320]   home board doesn't work correctly when you go into the browser.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.200]   You still got that problem where every phone that does not run Android has this liquid
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.760]   response to your touch.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.320]   This still has the sort of thing where you touch and that it thinks from a moment about
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.080]   what you want to do and then it activates whatever thing the button was supposed to do.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.720]   Andy, Andy, what you're saying is that it's like a Mercedes.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   No, God.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   I got to get out of here.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.040]   So you know, you know, you know, you know, you know that that episode of fat Albert with
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.720]   a fat Albert kids is either going to build their own car.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   Yeah, that's the that's the end for me.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.040]   Like individual components that OK, that's a really nice steering wheel.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.880]   Those are two really good wheels or two really good back good tractor wheels.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.600]   But we put it back to get all together.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.560]   It's like, Oh, this really is not a pleasant thing to smell or to drive it.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.120]   Well, iOS itself is consistent.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.080]   I do have to say that one of the things that's always bugged me about all apps, iPhone apps
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.080]   are just as bad.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.360]   If not worse, is that every UI is different in every app.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.160]   You have to learn every app I pick up.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   You've got to figure out how to use it again because there's kind of no standard about
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.720]   how the apps work.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.400]   So there is that feeling the iPhone too.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.960]   I think iPhone fanatics kind of ignore that, but that's really a problem.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.000]   I don't think that's a universal problem because I think that there's holistic elements
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.200]   of the Android interface that no matter what app you use and no matter how you're navigating
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.600]   for one app to another, you still have to deal with this top level Android.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.960]   I also think that the community of iOS developers is a little bit more thoughtful in how they
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.400]   lay out an app and how they present those features to the user than the Android community.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.720]   They're way more thoughtful.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.600]   It's like Mercedes Benz dealers.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.960]   Did you, by the way, did anybody see the?
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.360]   I don't even know where that's going.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:27.400]   Did you see that Motorola and I think Sony both put out these lengthy explanations of
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.880]   why they want to buy a screen sandwich anytime soon?
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Really?
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.800]   And part of it was we need to spend a lot of time modifying the user interface.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.200]   And that made me so sad because their phones would be so much better if they didn't modify
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   the user interface.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.000]   It just gave you raw ice cream sandwich.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.840]   I just wish touch whiz would go away.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.040]   My favorite Android phones are the ones that have the Google logo on the back where they
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.920]   didn't mess with it as little as pos.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.000]   I'm sorry, no, I think there are two ways to do Android correctly.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.360]   One is to simply say, accept every decision that Google make.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   Don't try to clutter it.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.160]   Don't add crap where don't add any sort of layer on top of it.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.360]   The other answer is to say, we're going to throw out everything they did.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.600]   We're going to build a brand new interface that's more unified, more pretty and a little
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.760]   bit more focused on the task at hand than what Android as it is originally conceived
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.920]   can do for you.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.160]   When you do anything in the middle, especially when you have something like Moto Blur, like
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.400]   oh honey, isn't it adorable?
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.640]   We're going to put this interface you created on the fridge.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   We're so proud of it.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.120]   Oh, that's lovely.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.760]   And then you go back to using the plain ice cream sandwich.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   Slightly different.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   There's the worst solution.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.240]   There's only so many talented UI designers in the world.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.520]   I think at some level, Samsung and Motorola forget that.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.120]   All the really good ones are probably already working at Google and Apple.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.440]   You can't like Josh always says it's jokingly on our podcast.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.800]   You can't crowdsource talent.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   It's true.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.280]   You can't just hire some guys and be like, do some stuff to Android.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.000]   It'll be cool.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.880]   It's like they've forgotten that that is like they're actually limited by the available
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.960]   talent to them.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:07.920]   And it's funny because Microsoft sells Windows to all these PC makers and they're not allowed
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.920]   to screw with it.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   Right.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920]   Well, they're allowed to screw with it.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   But like, but 10% you know, and Motorola is at 100% they can't change the menu bar icon
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   and things like that.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920]   Right.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.640]   And I just wonder if someday Google is going to say, well, in order to get Gmail on this
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.320]   phone and market on this phone, which you need to have embedded it, you have to get
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.760]   to scale it back or allow users to turn it off or do some exert some more control because
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.120]   particularly now with this phone, which is the phone that I think everybody should buy
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.920]   and I think a lot of other reviewers, if you're going to buy Android phone, this is one to
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   buy.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.480]   You know, Verizon is basically been trying to knife this phone for months, right?
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.280]   It came out months ago or weeks ago and Verizon held it into the last possible meeting.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.280]   So they could sell the droid because they have a deal with Motorola, right?
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:52.440]   But Google's buying Motorola.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.840]   So it's like this very complicated, tense political situation.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.080]   I think eventually Google will have to exert some more control because they're not able
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.840]   to compete at the rate which they should be competing with Apple because this phone is
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.320]   competitive with the iPhone.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320]   For me.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.080]   I mean, Rivera, who hosts are all about Android show and is also the producer of this show
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.760]   and is sitting on the board right now.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.120]   Somebody in the chat room said you had a Google Plus post from an Android engineer.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   Me?
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120]   Is that not the case?
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.520]   So anyway, they said somebody maybe wasn't you.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.800]   The post said that we started writing Android not in response to the iPhone but in response
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.200]   to the Blackberry and that it was his opinion.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.440]   It's that old that in his opinion, if you want to get it to really be snappy and fluid like
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.480]   the iPhone, it's going to require ground up rewrite.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   I know.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   I saw that post.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   We saw.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.360]   That was a former, a former Android guy who said that or he was like an intern on the
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   Google.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360]   Oh, that's depressing.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.720]   But yeah, it's partially that Android is relatively speaking an older mobile operating
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   system in some ways compared to Windows phone where they did a lot more brand new stuff.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   Apple always does that and Apple designs its own silicon, which really makes a huge difference.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.280]   If you're going to use an off the shelf TIO map processor, you're not going to have the
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.720]   same kind of fluidity as you're creating your own A5.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.120]   Oh, no, I believe this.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.880]   So he's bought the shelf until processors and their laptops.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   They have great fluidity.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.680]   Well, but they're much more power.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.240]   This is a resource constrained environment.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.000]   When those phone is pretty darn snappy and it's just in the same processors.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.960]   I wish I don't have a citation for this.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.600]   I remember reading something recently from an Android engineer who was saying that the
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.440]   bit of software that translates touch into action is a comparatively lower level process.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   Right.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.600]   I'm sorry, secondary process to on Windows phone and on iOS.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.840]   This is like the process was full first priority is the interaction between the glass and
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840]   the fingertip.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.960]   The glass Android is one of those things that sort of gets around to after it's figured
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.160]   it's out to somehow charge for text.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.040]   I think there's something to be said for the fact that Apple has 1000 people working
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.160]   on its A5 chip.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.000]   They spend a lot of time tweaking that chip.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.440]   And I think I've got to think that one of the things you're tweaking the chip for is
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.800]   that exact kind of fluidity and on screen performance.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.800]   They care about it more.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.720]   I think that last statement is really the point of it.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.400]   The point is not that they have their own thousand people working on a chip.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.880]   The point is that they care about this stuff.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.880]   If you care about it, once you get this engineering sample and you realize that this really doesn't
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.560]   work as well as it should, you delay it about a month or you forget that you ever announced
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.640]   this sort of thing.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.280]   If you decide it's Friday, it's one o'clock.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.240]   Who wants to go out for waffles?
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.680]   So there is a response Andrew Munn is saying the choice for Apple is literally between touch
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   response and waffles.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   That's it.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   You know, when there's a good special at Denny's, you've got those Christmas waffles.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.400]   No matter how much Google cares, there's a lot of what they can do because they're not
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.760]   making the handsets.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.320]   Google could care more and do a better job, I think, but it's still ultimately after
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.720]   HTC and Samsung and Sony Arcsome.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.440]   By the way, lots of corrections, just briefly.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.480]   I found a post which we'll put in our show notes, lots of corrections to the original
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.840]   laggy post, which says you're full of it.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.720]   I'm the former lead developer on the Android library.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.600]   You're wrong.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.040]   So apparently there's some makes and qualifications.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.080]   You don't think, I hear from Qualcomm all the time.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.480]   Our Snapdragon team works very closely with Google to make sure our chips do everything
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   correctly.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.240]   When Google does an access device, they bring in an OEM and a chip vendor to build it all
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   together.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.560]   I mean, they're trying to do, at least in theory, the exact same thing that Apple does, but
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.600]   in a different way because they rely on multiple vendors.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:37.520]   I mean, it's kind of foolish to say, you know, Qualcomm's 20,000 employees don't care about
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.320]   scrolling performance the same as Apple's 1,000 employees.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.400]   I think there's advantages to saying what your priorities are that you can say as a company
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.120]   as Apple can say, well, we're not going to put flash in, so don't worry about that.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.400]   When I say that, when I say that in the same way that Apple doesn't care that all kinds
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.120]   of flash content is implable on the iOS, I don't mean, perhaps the more accurate way
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.040]   to say is that they don't regard that that I don't believe that Google believes that
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:08.480]   integration and really polished fit and finished is as high a priority for them as other things
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   on the menu are.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.160]   I do feel like I think that's demonstrated by pretty much every Android's hand said I've
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160]   ever had.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.440]   I do feel like it's actually demonstrated by a lot of Google products as well.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.120]   I mean, I don't disagree with you on that level, but on the level of Apple's doing it
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.640]   better because they design their own chips.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.480]   I think there's a lot of area.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480]   All right.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   It's just the theory.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   I could be wrong.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   It barely happens.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.640]   But once in a while, I was queued up there.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.440]   It was just a theory.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   I'm not going to fight.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.960]   Just a theory for Harry.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.280]   We're going to find something you want to talk about.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.960]   Don't shut up.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.560]   Don't shut up.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.800]   Coming up, the big story of the week, according to Harry McCracken, of technology, you figured
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   out what it is, Harry.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.560]   You tell me, but first I want to tell you about carbonite.com.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.600]   I can't tell you.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.560]   I live in the real world, unlike you guys, because I do this radio show six hours a week.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.280]   I talk to normal users, normal people.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.840]   It's a different world out there.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.240]   Most of them are not backing up their hard drive, for instance.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.440]   I get calls every single week from somebody who said, "Yeah, my hard drive died and there's
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   some stuff on there."
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.440]   I got a call.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.160]   This was the saddest call I ever got.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:36.040]   A guy says, "My dog died and the only pictures I have on my dog are on my iPhone.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   My iPhone died.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.360]   Is there any way to get those pictures back?"
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.040]   It's like, "No."
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   I'm sorry, but no.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.520]   Really, it comes down to being proactive.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.880]   You got to back up first.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.480]   You can't back up after the hard drive crashes.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.040]   You got to back up before the hard drive crashes.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.920]   Good backup to me, good backup happens all the time.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.760]   It's automatic.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.240]   It's not backing up.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.760]   You certainly find backup to a USB drive right next to your computer and all that stuff.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.400]   There should be one backup that's offsite.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.960]   It's just not next to your computer.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.240]   If the house burns down, you got a backup.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.440]   Somebody steals all your stuff.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   You got a backup.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.400]   So many people are going around with laptops.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.560]   I had the stat last year.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   I can't remember what it was.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.520]   100,000 laptops a year are left on the X-ray machine and never recovered.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.680]   They're just gone at the airport.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.320]   They're gone forever.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.680]   People lose data all the time.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.440]   If they've been using carbonite, they wouldn't have had this problem.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.280]   Carbonite online backup.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.480]   This is continuous automatic backup whenever you're connected to the internet.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.760]   Now, it's done very nicely, so it doesn't slow your system down or your internet connection
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   down.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.880]   It just trickles it up.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   They do give you the first two weeks free when you use the offer code, "Twit."
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.720]   The reason for that is to get that first backup set done.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.360]   Then from then on, it just keeps it up to date all the time.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360]   I love this.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.720]   Now, the basic carbonite is $59 a year per computer for unlimited backup.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.140]   Everything on your computer is hard drive, internal hard drive, less than $5 a month.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.140]   That is a great deal.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.520]   They do have other plans because people have told me in the past, "Oh, we'd like to backup
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.000]   external drives," and so forth.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.840]   They have a variety of plans.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:20.040]   The base plan is really affordable, $5 a month for everything on your internal drive.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.640]   There's small business plans, there's multiple, there's external drive plans and so forth.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.720]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.120]   Any of those plans you can try free for two weeks with no credit card.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.920]   Note that I love these free trials.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.040]   We always make sure we do all of these.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.480]   Almost all of our advertisers do these.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.280]   The only people who don't are the jewelry people and Ford.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280]   Actually Ford does.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.080]   You can go to a Ford dealer and try it.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.120]   The jewelry people won't let you take home and ring and try it for a week.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   Try it for a week.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120]   See if you like it.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   Actually, you can because you can return it.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]   They have a good return.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   But don't mind.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.120]   Everybody does it.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   Carbonite.com.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   Offer code to it and try it free for two weeks.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.360]   If you decide you want it, no pressure.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   Just try it first.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.000]   If you decide you like it, use it to it again.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.840]   You'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.520]   So it's even more affordable.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.080]   Please backup.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.320]   Just do me a favor.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   It's $10.99.com.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   Use our offer code for best results.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.120]   Harry McCracken.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.320]   The story of the week.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   Well, I think we covered several of them.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   Oh, damn.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.840]   We haven't talked about Ram and this week's set of bad news for the Blackberry.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.840]   Let me think.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.520]   So they got the executives got fired that got drunk on the plane.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.320]   The guys are chewed through their restraints.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   They chewed through their restraints.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   They chewed through their restraints.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320]   So I think we got it.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.320]   We got it.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   We got it.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.320]   They saw it all the way through.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320]   These guys are on a Beijing, Toronto flight.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320]   They get on the flight.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320]   They're abusive.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320]   They're having problems.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.320]   Finally, I had more drunk on the plane.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   They kept having more drinks on the plane.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   That's a mistake.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   So finally, I didn't even know you could do this, but apparently flight attendants have handcuffs.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   Plastic ones.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.320]   You know, those ones that they, so they, they, they tied them into the seat.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.000]   And they, and they cuffed them.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.640]   And the guys chewed through their restraints.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.320]   At one point, one guy was lying on the floor.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.840]   There's zip ties.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.360]   Anyway, they got arrested and they got fired.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   But that's not the worst news.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.320]   I mean, well, the worst news is they're saying that the new next generation Blackberry is
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.840]   that might be neat, maybe a year away.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840]   Oh my God.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.400]   It feels like a year away as, you know, who knows what they're going to be competing
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400]   against them.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   I mean, phones will be flying by.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   Right.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.480]   And they said they're doing it because they're waiting for a chap.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.640]   But Apple has to wait for chips.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.800]   Google has to wait for chips.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.040]   Microsoft has to wait for chips.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.480]   I don't understand why RIM is different from everybody else.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   Big mistake.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.720]   You know, their first excuse is to why I wasn't on phones is because they didn't, the phones
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.720]   didn't have dual core processors.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.720]   Remember that?
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.720]   Yes.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.720]   That was last year's excuse.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720]   And now they do.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.520]   Now they're waiting for quad core processors, right?
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.520]   Or another chip.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520]   It's not our fault, guys.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.520]   It would ship industry.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:02.320]   I would love to see RIM flourish because it would be so much a better story.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.720]   If they knock people's socks off, but I don't say what happens at this point.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.680]   You don't think of behind the music style recovery.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.480]   RIM was on top of the world.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480]   Everybody loved them.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.520]   Then they started using drugs and they got, and they had problems and they were living
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.680]   in a trailer in, you know, trailer park in Poughkeepsie.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.560]   And then they discovered to court court and they're going to come back and they're going
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.560]   to be back again.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.760]   Well, I mean, up until now, I've always felt that they just came out with a really good
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.760]   product.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.560]   Good products can fix everything really.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.480]   But if it's a really good product that's, you know, two or three years late, that doesn't
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   solve anything.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.160]   And I also am just worried that RIM doesn't know what a good product is.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.120]   A company that could release the playbook seems to have lost touch with what it is the
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.920]   world wants out of them.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.160]   You know, I have some inside info on the playbook.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.880]   I have been very reliably informed that when the playbook was first conceived, it was shown
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.440]   to RIM's two CEOs, to Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsley.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.080]   Is that your pronounce his last name?
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.920]   And something like that.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:09.520]   And they basically shot down all of the good features of the playbook, including native
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.640]   email and they shipped the, they were told they were flat out told you were making this
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.200]   a bad product and they decided to ship it anyway.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.880]   I'm told now that it came right from the top in Canada.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.680]   It's pronounced ball silly ball silly.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.280]   All right.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.600]   And that's that's my new hip hop record as well.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.720]   No, I mean, I've been told that they from the top, they're the ones who took out the
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   features of the play.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720]   No email.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]   How could they say no email?
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   Their idea.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.560]   And they keep telling the rest of the world that everybody else was crazy and thinking
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.040]   that that a RIM tablet should have really good built an email.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.240]   I would say within a year, they're going to be running Windows phone.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.880]   I think Steve bomber knows it.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.480]   I think that's you.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.640]   He got Nokia.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:56.920]   He knows that people who like blackberries generally like them because they do BBM on
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.920]   the one hand and they do push email from exchange servers at work.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:06.280]   And if he can get Windows phone on blackberry with hard great hard work keyboards and all
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.400]   the rest of it, that's a huge win.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.120]   So I can't imagine Microsoft isn't just circling the wagons and sending sales exactly.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.560]   That's probably why those guys are drunk.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.280]   Microsoft guys got them drunk the night before trying to get them to do Windows phone because
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.640]   I see that as the only that's the only safe here.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.480]   And they're going to compete with Nokia and that by the way, we have that Lumia 800 here.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.480]   It's beautiful phone.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.480]   It's really nice phone.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.520]   Not a fantastic phone but a wonderful operating system.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520]   Right.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:34.600]   I mean, the sad thing is QNEX, which rim bought I guess several years after the iPhone came
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:39.120]   out, there's tons of potential for QNEX to be a good platform for a really smart phone.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.120]   I agree.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.840]   But it's just taking way too long by a factor of about five.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.320]   According to Larry Dignan and Zeedy Net, he says he's written an article said, "RIM's
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.920]   CEO tandem portrait of pathetic."
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:52.400]   He says, and I think this is the case, that these guys got to go.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.760]   They're only taking, here's the good news.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.440]   They're only costing $1 a year.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.000]   Larry says you get what you pay for.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.400]   I don't want to space CEO.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   But it's Steve Johnson.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.880]   Steve Johnson is their ticket dollar here.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   That's true.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880]   And a jet.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.800]   But isn't there a big problem that they know they don't build phones for users.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.880]   They build phones for administrators who then buy hundreds of them for users.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.520]   I think that's not a good way to make a compelling device that people are going to voluntarily
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.760]   want to drive and want to use.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.360]   I think it's how you basically make the fleet version of the Toyota Corolla that's not
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   exciting to anybody.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.160]   They'll drive it and they'll rent it from Hertz.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.120]   But it's just not the sort of thing you can build a business off of.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.800]   Because as soon as you lose that one person, you lose the five, six, seven thousand sales
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.120]   that they would have brought with them.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:45.240]   Well, it worked fine until an era where employees started picking their own phones.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.840]   My favorite thing that happened this week was the New York Times of the story on how
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.800]   there are dozens of Blackberry models.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.720]   And that might be part of the problem.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.800]   And they asked how many Blackberry models there were.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.280]   And RIM said, we don't know how many Blackberry models there are.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.000]   They should have spread that dollar in PR person.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.640]   I think it's going to be that high.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.400]   That's amazing.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.800]   You know, just say I'll get back to you.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800]   Exactly.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.520]   Is there any PR situation which the correct answer to any problem that question is, I
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   don't know.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.880]   I could go to their website and count them, but apparently they could not.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:27.040]   Can't you just say, oh, you know, I'm going to get right back to you.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   You make multiple Blackberry configurations for a variety of carriers.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.040]   That's it.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.040]   You were neat.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.240]   We're not focused on the number of products in the product line.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.200]   We're focused on the range of solutions we can provide for our many business plans.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.200]   He's been in the game for a long time.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200]   Thousand bucks.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:47.240]   Hey, you guys are masters of spin.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:50.320]   Let me ask you about long we're in the cell phone space, which we've been most of the
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   day.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.520]   By the way, prices have been dry.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.480]   Amazon Wireless has the Nexus for 150 bucks now.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.800]   So that's this actually 150 bucks.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.400]   That's not a bad deal.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]   300 bucks.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.160]   Yeah, but isn't it?
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.840]   There's some crazy early termination fee that you have to sell for course.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.800]   But why would anyone ever?
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.560]   It's not just it's not just the regular Verizon fee.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.160]   It's like an Amazon early termination.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.320]   We got to get rid of those because no, but I don't maybe it's just me, but it seems like
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.000]   the two years is a long time to keep one of these devices, right?
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.720]   I mean, two years from now, this is not going to be even close to the top of the line.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.160]   For real people or people like us?
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160]   Well, you're not for real people.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   Well, I agree.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:30.200]   I admit we're not real people, but but even for real people, don't you think that most
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.600]   phones after two years, smartphones are really out of date?
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.280]   This is this is the season where I get to see a lot of people's phones from a lot of
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.040]   different walks of life because they're all kinds of Hollywood parties going on.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.720]   And I'm really surprised to see how many people are using contract phones with slide out
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   keyboards.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   They're perfectly okay.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.720]   As long as they have a screen that lets them see the photos are being texted, but they
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.520]   don't really care about having a good camera.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.840]   They don't particularly care about apps, as long as they can get the five apps that really
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.800]   want one of them being Facebook.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:02.320]   So I'm not sure that the main driver, I'm not sure that the main masses of humanity is
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   really clamoring for $200 smartphone as much as they just want a simple phone that's reliable
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.600]   that they can get replaced very, very easily once they drop it down to the toilet.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.600]   That's why they all buy iPhones.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.400]   At the end of the day.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.280]   They know they can get an Apple stock.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.360]   No, I'd be honest.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.000]   I do think that we're Android is, I mean, my guess we're Android succeeding is at the
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.800]   low end of the marketplace, not the high end.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.800]   Yeah, of course.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.440]   These are cheap phones and basically disposable.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.600]   They're limited as much as I like to talk about form, fit and function and just things
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.560]   intuitively working great.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.080]   It's possible that a lot of people would much rather have an extra $150 in their pocket
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.920]   than something that is 100 points out of 100 for elegance as opposed to maybe 80 points
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.920]   out of 100.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.400]   So there's always reality.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.760]   Unfortunately, reality is not very happy person.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.320]   So it's so true.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.360]   A couple of Google stories and Google's response to Siri and we were talking about Google's
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.720]   voice recognition, which I think is quite good.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:07.760]   The rumor strong from Android and me that Madgell, how do you say that?
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.880]   Madgell, named after Madgell, Roddenberry, could be released by the end of the year.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.960]   Well, that's the next couple of weeks, isn't it?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.440]   The difference between, as we mentioned, between Siri and Google's voice actions, which are
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.000]   very good and dictation, which is very good, is natural language.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.240]   You have to know the command for it to work in Google.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.560]   Whereas with Siri, you could be a little bit looser.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.240]   I like Siri.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:39.080]   I can't remember, was it on the show or before the show we were talking about how Siri seems
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.440]   to be down a lot, which is the only real frustration in Siri.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.920]   So good, you don't want it to be down.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   Google seems to be more reliable, but I guess nobody's using it probably.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   Are we excited?
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   Madgell, Barrett, Majel?
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920]   Majel.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.480]   I don't know why I'm so much trouble with Majel.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.440]   It's like major with an L.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   Majel.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440]   Barrett, Roddenberry.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.440]   Not really.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.440]   No.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:08.520]   I would just like to see Google do a consummate follow through on any one product or any one
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   project.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.760]   I'm encouraged by what I've heard and read about and been told about Majel, but I'm not
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.400]   really until they actually deliver it and until they demonstrate that they're committed
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.440]   to not just the initial release, but the incremental updates that have to happen over a course
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.640]   of a year and a half before it becomes a real thing.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   Am I really going to get excited about it?
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.520]   Who are they going to roll it out to?
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520]   Just Galaxy Nexus owners?
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.520]   Yeah, or how?
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.520]   I think that's a big unanswered question.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.320]   Is it a standalone app though?
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   Isn't it?
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.760]   Could you update the app or no?
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.760]   Is it OS?
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.760]   Nobody knows.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.320]   I mean, if it's an app, then it makes sense.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.280]   There's a lot of ways to use the app updates and Google's broken out all the apps that
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   way.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.080]   So the reason it's named after Majel is because she is the voice of the...
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.200]   Here, let me play a little...
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.200]   This is...
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.760]   Paramount's not Lipsidious, are they?
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.280]   Here's a little...
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:07.000]   She's the only actor to participate in all six Star Trek TV series.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   I'm going to hear so...
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   I can't hear it.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.680]   Is it me?
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.680]   She's not making any sense.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:16.160]   She's the voice of the computer, played number one, Nurse Christine Chappell, Loaxana
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.840]   Troy, the voice of the Federation computer, the narrator and many more, and of course Gene
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:24.520]   Ronberry married her, which probably had something to do with that.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.960]   It's a little nepotism.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.720]   Why can't I hear the voice of the computer?
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.920]   YouTube knows we're about to pirate something in this...
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920]   Universal!
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920]   This is called...
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920]   What do they call it?
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]   Prior restraint, Mr. Attorney?
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.840]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.200]   It's a chilling effect.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200]   Chilling effect.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.760]   They will no longer let us play clips from YouTube.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.720]   I bet there's a button somewhere in the Universal Music Group in Hollywood, then there's some
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.360]   guy with a cigar and plaid pants who just pushed it and said, "Don't let those twit
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.600]   guys play nothing."
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.800]   There's a guy assigned to you.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.520]   Computer, go ahead.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.280]   Next message received and recorded from Captain Kirk.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280]   Here she is.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.280]   In place.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.280]   Run a true analyte.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.080]   She wasn't very good then.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.920]   Yep, that's Android, all right.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.920]   Not the Captain Boy.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920]   Negative.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   Listen to the way!
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:11.920]   A voice duplicator.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   98% probability.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.920]   Wow.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:21.320]   Should we make it some more natural or is that a notation okay for everybody?
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.320]   Ahhh.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.520]   She was totally laggy.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.280]   She was really laggy.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.600]   Wow.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.320]   That's amazing.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.800]   In those days it seemed fast.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.480]   Our standards have really changed.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.200]   Now not that it makes much difference, is anybody still talking about the AT&T mobile
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.040]   merger?
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:45.600]   The Justice Department and AT&T have halted court proceedings until January.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.000]   We're so tired.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.640]   We just wanted, let's take the holidays off.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.800]   I'll see you in January.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:59.680]   They don't even know, I think the courts confuse as to what AT&T is trying to push right now.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.840]   The judge, I think, was straight up asking, is this even a lawsuit to pursue for you right
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   now?
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.600]   What do you, FCC has said no effectively.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.000]   What are you going to do if you win?
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.360]   AT&T is like, I don't know, let's find out.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.680]   And that's an enormous waste of everyone's time.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.360]   I think what's really happening here is they've agreed to halt it so that AT&T can figure
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.400]   out exactly what it's trying to do because I don't think they know.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.840]   And that's who knows.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:33.080]   I think at this point AT&T needs to give up with this idea and try something else.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.920]   They're clearly not.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.640]   Our government, our government, is actually being effective.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   It's shocking.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.520]   That does that happen.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.080]   We're taking a break.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.920]   The big Facebook announcement is timeline is here.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.720]   And we're going to turn it on for everybody and ask you guys what you think of that.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.600]   And just a second, I'm loving path on an Android and iPhone.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.880]   I'm loving path.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.960]   It's like timeline.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.560]   It looks so much like timeline, but it's mobile only.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.320]   Anyway, we'll talk about that in a second.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.480]   First let's talk a little bit about four.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.080]   We had three Ford vehicles in this week.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.880]   Do we have a video from that yet?
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.920]   No, I think it starts tomorrow.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   Tomorrow?
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920]   Okay.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.840]   We borrowed a focus of fiesta and a Mustang, which I never saw.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.880]   I just want to say, who drove the Mustang because it wasn't me.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   I drove the Fiesta.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.640]   They said, "Leo's got a Mustang.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.000]   Let him drive the Fiesta."
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.640]   Actually, the Fiesta has the sync services.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.200]   That was a really good example because if the Mustang and the Focus had the big screen
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.800]   in the middle, but not all the sync doesn't require a big screen, because the whole point
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.240]   of sync is you're not looking at the screen, you're supposed to keep your eyes on the row
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.240]   and your hands on the wheel.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240]   We're talking safety first.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:47.880]   And that's what's so cool about Ford Sync is you have a button located differently on each
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.280]   car on my Fiesta.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.000]   It was on the turn signal.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.400]   On the Focus, it's a paddle behind the wheel on my Mustang.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.120]   It's right on the wheel.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.000]   You press the button and you talk to the car, just like Majel there, although it's a little
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.800]   more snappy and he'll have a lot better.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.320]   Nice female voice.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.840]   You could say things like, "What's my commute like?"
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:13.280]   Now you can set it up on the website, 4.com/Sync, where your home is, where your office is.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.280]   And then it knows.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.280]   You say, "Well, I'm here.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.640]   I'm going to go home.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.640]   What's the commute like?"
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.040]   "I tell you."
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.240]   You could say, "I asked it, "What's the commute like to San Francisco?"
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.240]   It told me how it was going.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.560]   You can ask for sports scores, news stories to be read to you.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.120]   It'll even tell you your horoscope, which is pretty wild.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.720]   All without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.720]   I just love that.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.000]   You'll get traffic alerts for frequently traveled routes.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.320]   They can even text them to your phone.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:47.160]   Ford's really taking 21st Secretary of Technology, putting it not only in the engines, but in
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.840]   the cabin itself so that you've got state of the art.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:54.640]   You're connected with this amazing Ford Sync in my Ford Touch.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.080]   I want you to test drive one of these Ford's.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.920]   The new 2012 Ford Focus, beautiful.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.000]   I really love driving that.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.920]   Or go to the website, 4.com/technology.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.760]   We do have video of all of the features we've been talking about.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.080]   What we did is we got in there with Brent in a camera.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.600]   We drove around town.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.080]   You'll also see in these videos, you'll see bits of Petaluma.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.520]   Because Brent, he's a good camera.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.840]   He said, "No, let's drive here.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   Let's drive there."
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.600]   We got some travel logs.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   We'll start using those later in the week.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:29.600]   Meanwhile, Ford.com/technology, you'll find out all about the amazing technology.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:37.560]   I'm going to have dinner with Alan Malali, the CEO of Ford, and their CTO in Vegas.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560]   Don't get mad at me on Tuesday.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.680]   Don't get mad at me.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.400]   I know we got other things to do.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.440]   When the CEO of Ford says, "What do you have dinner with me?"
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.280]   I'm going to say yes.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.880]   That means we get more sponsorships.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:51.880]   Well, I just...
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.880]   No, no.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.880]   Shake that cup, Leo.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   No, I don't do that.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.880]   I can't do that.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.880]   I won't do that.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:58.880]   I don't do the sales at all.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.800]   He said, "We want to talk to you about your experience using this stuff.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.720]   We want to get your feedback as a technology report.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.200]   We want to know what you think."
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Actually, I do have some...
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:08.200]   I have some input.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.200]   It's not all positive.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.280]   I'm going to tell you you need to do this.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   I want to see this.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.160]   I'm just thrilled that they are actually saying what we want to hear from people.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.520]   No, it's really interesting about that.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   They sponsor you.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.600]   They're getting really big into this.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.000]   They're sponsoring us at CES.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.600]   You could take the lawyers third down.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.600]   That's fine.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.600]   Really?
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.600]   They're sponsoring you at CES.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.080]   Yeah, the Ford CES 2012 sponsor by Ford.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.080]   That's great.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.080]   We're very excited about it.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.520]   I think one of the reasons they're doing that kind of stuff is...
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.960]   A couple weeks ago, there was a survey released that said, "More teenagers are excited about
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:43.040]   getting an iPhone than their first car."
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.760]   I think that they want to combat that.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.480]   I think they're waking up to the fact that cars are gadgets.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.960]   Fundamentally, cars are gadgets for people.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:53.680]   They want to be seen as innovative and pushing forward.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.680]   I think that's really commendable.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   It's hard.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680]   It's a car.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.240]   You only buy one every five years or whatever.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.760]   I think there's a lot of work that has to do in terms of making it modular and making
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.120]   the software upgrade and all the nuts and bolts we take for granted.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.480]   That's what the deal is with the sync services and the app stuff, the app link stuff, because
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   Alan told me that.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.280]   He said, "We know you're going to upgrade your phone fast and you're going to upgrade
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   your Ford."
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.240]   We will make sure that we interface with the phone because that's where the new technologies
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.400]   are going to come in through the back door.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.360]   They're doing a good job at that.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.400]   Yeah, and they're all doing it.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.200]   Obviously, Ford is in this conversation because they're doing your ads and our ads, but all
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:31.280]   the makers are doing it actually.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.800]   I think it's something to keep an eye on.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.360]   It's fascinating because I talked about this with Alan.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.360]   The turnaround for designing a car is many more years than it is to design this, for
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360]   obvious reasons.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.200]   It's a much bigger project.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.840]   We really want to take advantage of the fast iteration that's happening in the app space
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.000]   and the smartphone space.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.760]   I think that's a smart move.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.280]   This guy's an engineer.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.360]   He understands all this stuff.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.560]   Timeline's turned on.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560]   Do you have it yet?
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.760]   I turned mine on back when they announced that there's a couple months ago.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.440]   Developer hack, yes, so did I.
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.760]   I like it, but I'm just waiting to hear the pushback from those people that you have Christmas
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.480]   dinner with, Andy and Aco.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.760]   The real people, the little people.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   The humans.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.760]   The humans.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.680]   It's a massive change.
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.560]   Let me show you my timeline.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.760]   I do believe that I think they're rolling it out everywhere.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.760]   Now you have a big picture up front.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.400]   It's more like this is my life, the story of my life.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.000]   All the way back to the start.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.280]   You can go all the way back to when you were born, which is kind of wild.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.960]   Oh, no, you put it in there.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   I like it.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   Of course.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   I didn't do that yet.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.960]   I'm a little nervous.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:44.960]   No, you got it.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   Why are you nervous?
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.280]   You don't want to show people your baby pictures?
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:53.800]   I'm worried that there's a whole, whole area between 1999 to 2005 that will be the
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   end of my career.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.960]   So mine's pretty locked out.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.200]   I got that area too.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.560]   In fact, this is the picture.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560]   But see, I don't care.
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.560]   I don't know what that is.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560]   I'm holding.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.000]   I think it's a flower face.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.640]   My daughter, I was given this at the, this is in college at the college reunion.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.280]   I was given this picture.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.720]   That's me in the suit.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.160]   And my daughter said, "Daddy, what is that you're holding?"
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160]   Nice.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.920]   I didn't inhale.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920]   Although I don't know.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.920]   I must have.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:22.920]   Look at my hair.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.920]   Something happened.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.920]   Wow.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   Wow.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.920]   Wow.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.360]   The work is way through yellow is a plumber.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360]   That's it.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.960]   There he is fixing a greased trap.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.680]   I was in the plexiglass class.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:37.680]   That's what it was.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.360]   I think we actually made that.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.840]   So timeline guaranteed to get you in trouble, right?
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.680]   But only if you have to decide to put that stuff up there.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.040]   I'm going to put those pictures in there.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.080]   Well, I take it back because of friction free sharing, you may decide and forget and
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.080]   things may be shared.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.600]   For instance, every time I play a song on Spotify, boom, it goes in the timeline.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.600]   I like the timeline.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.160]   I do not like frictionless sharing because at some point, if you can see every single
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.760]   action I take, then it's not a portrait of me.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.760]   And the same way it is if I decide what's important.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.360]   The other issue that people have raised with me is that when timeline turns on, default
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.280]   settings get changed towards more public.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.120]   So Facebook, I would think they would have learned.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120]   I thought they said they weren't going to do that anymore.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.120]   No, they signed a 20-year agreement with the FTC saying they were never going to do that
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.120]   again.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.120]   Okay.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   Well, maybe that was, I was misinformed.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.760]   Or maybe they just realized that, hey, we've got $16,000 per instant per day.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:38.760]   What do we care?
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.400]   No, I think that there will be, I think people right now, Facebook, things tend to fade into
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:46.400]   the background.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.840]   So there's a lot of stuff in a background of people's accounts that may be public and
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.600]   they are public and Facebook isn't changing the settings, but they are changing the way
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.280]   the stuff is exposed and it's easier to go back.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:02.640]   Well, you said, I think, and I think people are going to find that to be kind of jarring.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]   Which is cool.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.120]   Which is why they're giving you the, it's like seven day in.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120]   Seven days.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120]   Seven days.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:13.000]   But doesn't it, even if, so, but even after seven days doesn't it turn on no matter what?
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.600]   Well, once you hit the button, so you hit the button now.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.120]   So you don't have to go to timeline.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.640]   You will have to go to timeline though.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.680]   Some time in the future, but the idea is that you get the seven day amnesty now.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.680]   Right.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.760]   And I think you should always follow the practice of not doing anything on Facebook, either publicly
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.000]   or privately that might embarrass you.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]   Right.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000]   And as long as you do that, you're fine.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.160]   I tell kids that just assume that it's going to be public because you can't, we're so complicated.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]   You can't be sure it won't be.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.480]   I mean, even if you make it private, the people you share it with can make it public.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480]   Exactly.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.480]   Exactly.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.000]   Man, Leo, your, your vision of the future is so like, it's like everything will be copied
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]   and taken by pirates and everything you do is public.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.080]   And you, it's like it's, but once both extremely idealistic and extremely terrifying.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.080]   It's the way it's going to be.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.520]   I just, I just call it like it is.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.600]   I think that's where we're headed.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.960]   I don't, I'm not choosing this vision of the future.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.880]   It's just what I'm, what I think is happening.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:08.880]   You're just the herald.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.280]   I am just the bad news bearer.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.880]   You're the ghost of Christmas future.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.960]   I think everybody should turn on timeline and start to learn the settings because it's
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:18.960]   it's common.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.480]   It's the biggest change in I love it.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.320]   But again, I'm a very public person.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.480]   And so, you got it, you know, everything, people know everything about me more than I
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.200]   more than I even realize.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.920]   Facebook really does need an almost not, not an offline mode.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.080]   Does that be impossible?
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:36.800]   But a way to simply say, I want you to disconnect me from the social web.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.440]   I want to play with settings and have a live fire exercise on how these changes are going
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.200]   to affect visibility of items in my timeline.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.840]   And those don't actually go out into the social web until I flip the switch back on again.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.720]   Because now I've done some experiments and I've proven to myself that no bad things are
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.120]   going to happen from this.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   Facebook is a monster.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.080]   That's too big and too complicated at this point for anybody to really understand how
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.880]   any of it works or most of it works anyway.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:09.040]   So according to the National Transportation Safety Board, you guys should not be making
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.880]   phone calls while you're in your car.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.600]   I'm not talking banning, I'm not saying requiring hands.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:20.160]   Look at looking at making phone calls on their cell phone.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.280]   I'm not taking, I'm not saying hands free.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.680]   I'm saying you should not be making phone calls while you're in your car.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.720]   This is doing anything else or anything else.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.080]   The NTSB made a recommendation to ban all non driving related use of personal electronic
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.720]   devices while in the driver's seat, including hands free.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.360]   Of course, it's 35 states.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.920]   It's against a lot of text while driving.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.920]   We're not saying that.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.560]   We're saying don't, you can't even, you can't even have a call come in and answer it.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.280]   Now the New York Times had a good article today and a Sunday Times about this.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:04.360]   And they said the problem is human beings are completely unable to ignore that incoming
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.800]   text or phone call because we are driving.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.360]   We are social beings.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.000]   We're driving in the car all alone.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.600]   We're lonely.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.680]   And something happens.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.520]   The phone goes, and you, I got it.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.960]   Ooh, I can't talk.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960]   I got it.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.160]   Oh, I got to see it.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.320]   And so they should have a thing in the car that just disconnects all.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.240]   You know, it's funny about the NTSB thing.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.080]   Well, first, the sort of big joke is that we, you know, we sent our writer TC SOTIC to
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.920]   cover the announcement because he's in DC and they held it in a room with no cell phone
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.920]   service.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920]   Of course not.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.920]   That's pretty funny.
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.840]   But the second thing is that they made this recommendation that all shades should
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.840]   bathe in.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.560]   They made a negative recommendation, right?
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.880]   Everybody should ban this instead of making the positive recommendation, which is all
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.640]   cars should have Bluetooth, right?
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.200]   Because that's really, that solves your problem.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.400]   No, they don't even want you talking.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.640]   No, they want you talking.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.280]   I think hands free is fine.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.800]   We don't need to know hands free.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   They say no hands free.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.800]   They say you can't talk on the phone.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   No, nothing.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.800]   Nothing.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.160]   You can't use the device if you're driving.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.080]   That wasn't clear when we caught we asked them and they didn't do that.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.320]   That's a new clarification.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.360]   That's what the story says.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:25.480]   We talked about this Tuesday, Andy, on Mac break weekly when this broke and we pointed
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.000]   out for Christ's sake, are they going to ban radios?
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.880]   Are they going to ban makeup?
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.040]   Are they going to ban Egg McMuffins?
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.040]   What's next?
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.760]   I mean, it just doesn't have anything sessions.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.120]   Just in the heat settings of my car takes my eyes off the road for a second and a half,
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.120]   two seconds.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.120]   It's okay.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.960]   You wait for a moment when you're not crossing a like word, baby ducks are crossing before
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.320]   you actually take your eyes off the road.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.080]   I do think that the same standard should apply to phones as to anything else that's
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.960]   operable by the driver on the dashboard.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:59.080]   So long as you have the phone in a cradle, so you're not costly doing like this between
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.320]   the road and the handset.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.080]   So long as you do have an adequate hands free, as long as you have a phone that's with an
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.320]   interface, it doesn't require you to drill down into several, not as long as you're not
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.000]   trying to do something that requires you to drill down into several different layers
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.280]   of menus to get somewhere.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.040]   I've got absolutely no problem with somebody reaching over and clicking a next track button
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.800]   to click on the next track somewhere.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.600]   Does happen though, that people do that and plow into pedestrians or buy it.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.440]   It happens here all the time because this is a very popular area to bicycle on the highway
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.520]   and people get run over all the time because somebody was changing it cassette.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.800]   But they make with alcohol, they make the penalties for drunk driving so severe as to
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   make it very clear and not supposed to do that.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.880]   They don't hook up a breathalyzer to every single car dashboard to make sure you cannot
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.920]   physically operate the vehicle if you've used breathaments or mouthwash in the past half
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920]   hour.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.400]   I just think we shouldn't let people drive.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.160]   I think no, I'm in favor of a congressional mandate so that I get to be driven around wherever
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.960]   I go whenever I want.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:02.160]   Because you should be a trained professional.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.840]   It should take a four year course to before you're allowed to actually.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.840]   I mean, if you think about it, we're letting complete morons pilot three ton vehicles at
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:16.120]   60 miles an hour down the highway that you should you ought to have to have a certification
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:20.040]   of some kind, like a license of some kind.
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.080]   For instance, oh, oh, you see, you want a statewide photo ID system, don't you?
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.080]   Yes.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.280]   You're trying to control voter registry.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:30.120]   Yes, we could create these things called departments of motor driving.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.120]   Great.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.720]   Another government bureaucracy who pays for that.
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:37.840]   Taxpayers like me Johnny Johnny taxpayer Johnny taxpayer.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:43.480]   I know you part of the 40% doesn't care about those of us in the 60%.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.920]   And meanwhile, in American Airlines is giving iPads to all its pilots.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:52.480]   So there they'll be playing plants versus zombies instead of flying the freaking plane.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   FAA does say you can get to give up all those pounds of paper.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480]   I don't know.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480]   It was like 35 pounds of paper.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.480]   They bring into the cockpit instead, just bring an iPad.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480]   But they should have a rule.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.280]   You can't have, you know, angry birds on there.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.200]   I think I'm just thinking the Kindle fire.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.200]   Thank you.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.640]   Harry McCracken says it's not doomed.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.960]   That's my considered opinion.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:12.960]   What a relief.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.680]   Well, though some people are saying that it's going to fail.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.680]   Really?
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.680]   Yes.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:18.680]   See, I like it.
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.360]   Annie and I both agree that we like it.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:23.800]   But the New York Times says it's the Edsel, the new Coke.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.040]   Yeah, they brought up the actually the times when they put up their story, they mentioned
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.120]   the Edsel and the headline.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:30.520]   I noticed they changed that.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   Oh, did they?
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.280]   They still mentioned the Edsel and the new Coke in the story.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.480]   Jacob Nielsen, they quote Jacob Nielsen.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.880]   He says it was going to fail.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.560]   And they do kind of look at the number, how good the star ratings are for the Kindle
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.560]   fire.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:48.120]   And actually the reviews of the Kindle fire on Amazon are not bad, although not quite
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.160]   as good as for the iPad.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.040]   And so we've kind of gone from irrational exuberance over the Kindle fire.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.360]   And people saying this is truly going to be the thing that's going to take on the iPad
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.440]   head to head to a rational depression over at and saying that because it's not perfect,
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.680]   it's not going to fail well.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.080]   It's got four stars out of five.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.400]   And Amazon is such a good track record for sticking with things.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.160]   The original Kindle from 2007, they were pretty miserable.
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.440]   But they stuck with that and they improved it and they brought out better models.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.960]   And a lot of companies don't do that.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.400]   And you have HP with the touchpad where when it's not a smash hit after six weeks, they
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.400]   give up.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.920]   Amazon actually, what sticks with things.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:32.280]   And even if this Kindle fire is not perfect, I think they'll improve the software.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   I agree.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.560]   And they'll be a better Kindle fire next year and a better one the year after that.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.440]   What do the folks at the Verge think of the fire?
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.880]   You know, I've played with it.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.760]   This version one is not.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.560]   I think version one is going to be fairly disappointing for people.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.680]   But as what it is, what it represents for Amazon, it's going to be a massive success.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.080]   I don't think there's any doubt.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:01.360]   I think it will be to this type of consumption tablet, what the Kindle was to ebook readers,
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.000]   where everybody tried to make one, but only Amazon was successful and only Barnes and
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.360]   Noble were successful because they have the content.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.280]   And I think that's what people want.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.760]   They want to watch video, right?
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.960]   They want to read books.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.160]   They have some work left to do.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.760]   It feels like a rushed product.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.560]   And you know, things like the email client, we use the email client on the fire.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.080]   It's a hilarious trip, right?
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080]   It was rushed.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.120]   I mean, the real Kindle fire is coming out next year.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.000]   This was the placeholder.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.280]   But you wouldn't say don't buy it.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.640]   I mean, I think there's a lot of people for whom this would be a nice Christmas gift.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.560]   The UIs all disappointing.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.800]   The degree to what you try to flip through your books and they don't come along or they
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.560]   come along too quickly is not good.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.040]   But people don't remember the original Kindle.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.960]   It had this huge page turn button.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.360]   And it was almost impossible to touch the original Kindle without shooting 40 pages ahead
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:49.360]   of that.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.360]   And I still bought it.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.360]   The original Kindle is one of the most bizarrely designed products.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   It was far and totally strange.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.000]   It looks like a beautiful nice way.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   Right.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.560]   You know, there's the French expression, Jolie Lad, beautiful ugly.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.200]   That's the Kindle, right?
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.200]   It's so ugly.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200]   It's beautiful.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:08.720]   Amazon says it's selling, they're not breaking it down, but they say they're selling it for
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:09.720]   the last three weeks.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.400]   And more than a million kindles of all kinds in the last, so three million kindles of all
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.560]   kinds in the last three weeks.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.200]   Which is one of the few times they've ever used actual numbers.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:22.360]   Usually they just say this Kindle is selling better than the old Kindle.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.680]   There's also the time when they've had the least expensive kindles in Amazon history.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.680]   They've got a $79 model.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.120]   They've got a $9.00 model that's ticked.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.240]   But yeah, we love to see a breakdown of those numbers.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.240]   Right.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.480]   But I think that the fires are very good.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.680]   I don't think it's just good enough.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.840]   I think it's a good tablet.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.720]   I just don't think that it's of the same level performance that anybody who's expecting a
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:45.920]   real tablet computer to adapt.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.360]   But if you're about to, when you consider that it wasn't too long ago that the E-ank version
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:56.240]   of this very Kindle costs exactly as much as the Kindle Fire does, but it didn't have
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:02.040]   color, didn't play videos, didn't have connection to all the Amazon services that are connected
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.320]   to and didn't run Android apps on the side.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.440]   I do still think that's a very good bargain.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.200]   Dave Lynn, Amazon's vice president of Kindle said the Kindle Fire in particular has been
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:18.160]   the best selling product of Amazon for the last 11 weeks.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:21.720]   It should be given the degree to which they've turned over their entire home page to promoting
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:22.720]   it.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:26.280]   They've sold millions of Kindle fires.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:27.280]   So they're doing all right.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.280]   They're doing all right.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:31.360]   I don't think there's a million people who are going to be unhappy about it.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.600]   I saw one in the wild for the first time on a plane ride last week.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.360]   I guess that next to guy was using one.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.000]   He said he had only two issues with that.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.880]   One of which was it's too heavy.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.880]   And he wished it was more Android-y.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.440]   He kind of felt like they were covering up the parts of Android he wanted to get out.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:57.680]   So I don't know if you know this, but many of us last week including Sarah Lane, Ryan,
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.680]   who was there?
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.680]   M.G.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:02.160]   Seagler, myself, Robert Scoble.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.760]   We visited the presidential palace in France.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.360]   We were at the Elize Palace.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.900]   To meet President Sarkozy, I have some good pictures of Alexiotsosis from Techcrutch shaking
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:11.900]   his hand.
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:13.920]   Robert Scoble saying, "Aunche on to A."
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.520]   To the president.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.960]   Who is this tall and heavily made up?
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.640]   However, I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that French President Sarkozy's
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.960]   residence has been implicated in a torrenting scandal.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:29.320]   Or maybe it does.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:34.480]   Sarkozy is very well known for his support of the Hadoop laws, the three strike laws
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   in France.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:39.480]   He's one of the reasons he invited all these people from the web there, as he wanted to
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.320]   kind of reach out.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.800]   Eric Schmidt was there, reach out of hand and say, "Look, we've got to work this out."
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.800]   He was just like, "You know what?
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.280]   You remind me a lot of you, Nili."
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.880]   He was saying, "Look, we just got to find a solution.
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.280]   We just got to work it out."
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.200]   He's also very charming in French, which I know are my main qualities.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.200]   Yes.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.620]   Apparently, IP addresses assigned to the Elize Palace have shown evidence of having bit-torn
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:06.900]   and six files, including the Beach Boys Greatest Hits.
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:12.800]   Lipschausenest de la Plaget.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:13.880]   Nothing more to say.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.880]   That's from the You Have Downloaded.com site.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.740]   I'm glad to say when I go there, it says, "You have not been..."
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:22.300]   None of my employees are using bit-torn, apparently.
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:27.380]   It's kind of weird, by the way, that site.
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:31.920]   It's when the record companies use those...
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.680]   They also get on there.
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.200]   Yeah, but they've been caught, right?
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:38.200]   Some record companies were caught.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:39.200]   Right.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:45.600]   But it's just funny that the response to the use of the tools completely flips when the
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.480]   actors are exposed.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.760]   When the record companies use the tools to find out who's committing copyright infringement,
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.760]   everyone freaks out.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.520]   They're tracking people on the internet.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:54:00.340]   But when Torrent Freak uses the tools to see that it's Sarkozy or somebody at Warner
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:02.660]   Brothers, then it's hilarious, right?
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:03.820]   And then the tools are great.
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:05.420]   And it's like, "You got it.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.420]   Come on."
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.780]   I mean, the tools are bad.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.780]   The tools are bad.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:10.420]   We shouldn't be using these tools.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.660]   I think the point is that if you're using bit-torn and you're not somehow otherwise obscuring
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.500]   who you are, you're in public.
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.540]   And I think that was the point.
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:22.980]   When I actually did practice copyright law, the only people...
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.700]   I represented kids who got sued for file sharing.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.260]   And I lost because they had all been file sharing.
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:32.820]   It's tough representing guilty clients, isn't it, Nila?
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.180]   It was a rough go.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:38.760]   But two in one, they had all been using Kazaa.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.740]   And the reason, I was like, "Why are you guys still using Kazaa?"
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.580]   And the reason the record, it was the low-hanging fruit.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.580]   They could go on Kazaa.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.300]   They could find the people and they could sue them.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.900]   And I was like, "Just do something else.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:52.820]   Look anything else is harder for them to track them."
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:53.820]   Anything, please.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:54.820]   One last story.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:02.340]   Any truth you think anybody to the rumor that Netflix might be for sale to Verizon?
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:08.260]   Netflix shares spiked 6% on December 12th, a couple of days ago on rumors that that would
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:09.260]   be the case.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:11.220]   I don't know why Verizon would buy Netflix.
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:13.780]   Although I guess it's a good deal right now.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.300]   Market cap of under $4 billion.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:19.220]   The other rumor is Verizon might start its own Netflix competitor.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.620]   Yeah, why not?
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.740]   I mean, why even buy it?
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:22.740]   Redbox.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.740]   Oh, interesting.
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:26.100]   Can you buy Netflix?
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:28.460]   You also buy a lot of obligations.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:29.860]   That's not...
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:30.860]   Start from scratch.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.860]   You're Verizon.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:33.500]   You're bigger than that.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:34.500]   And that's...
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.500]   Go ahead.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.820]   That's a really interesting thing.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.660]   I mean, if you think about...
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:43.900]   I don't know if it's true and I don't know if it should be true or if it's a good idea.
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:46.900]   But you think about Verizon buying Netflix.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:51.420]   That has the ramifications for the internet structurally, right?
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.660]   Because Verizon is a major ISP.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.700]   They own a lot of the wires in the ground.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:00.340]   But Netflix is a huge source of traffic for every ISP.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:04.500]   So all of a sudden, the peering arrangements that kind of make the internet work.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:08.380]   Where Verizon says to level three, we'll put some of your traffic on our pipes and some
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:09.940]   of our traffic on your pipes.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:14.020]   Those get disrupted by the fact that Verizon is now a huge content provider and traffic
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:16.700]   source for these other things.
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:17.700]   I don't know.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:21.740]   I mean, that changes the dynamics of that business, I think, in a very interesting way.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:24.060]   But I have no idea if it's true.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:27.100]   It does give Verizon an opportunity to throttle themselves.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:30.700]   I think we all know how public that works.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.420]   We know how all that works.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:33.420]   All right.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.500]   We're going to throttle this show right now.
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:42.780]   I want to thank you so much, Neelite Patel, for adding such great fire and verve and accurate
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.780]   information to our show today.
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:47.940]   Neelite is at The Verge, which is a really, really great site.
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:48.940]   You got to go there.
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:53.900]   The Verge.com, and he's reckless on Twitter.
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.060]   I always have a great time on this show.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.060]   Yeah, it's really fun.
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:57.220]   It's a great discussion.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:58.580]   This was a fascinating show.
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.780]   Thanks, too, to Harry McCracken, from Technologizer.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.100]   It was good to have you.
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:07.500]   I should give a plug to time.com and see not in all business, all of who I write for regularly
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.500]   as well.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.580]   By the way, Time did exactly the right thing picking the protester as the person of the
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.580]   year, I think.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.980]   That was a good move, I thought.
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:16.980]   Classy.
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:18.180]   State classy time.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.180]   That was them, right?
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.180]   Yes.
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:21.180]   Okay.
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:23.780]   I was surprised as anybody else for some strange reason they didn't ask me, but I thought
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:25.580]   I'd hardly endorse it anyway.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:26.580]   Yeah, I think this is good.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.380]   I mean, these are people who are changing.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:31.380]   Way better than Steve Jobs, by the way.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.380]   Yes.
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:35.540]   As though it is a shame, he never was in the past.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:39.020]   According to Isaacson, he thought he was going to get it and did an interview with
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.020]   Time and everything.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:41.820]   It was pissed off when they gave it to the computer.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.820]   It was like an 82 or whatever that was.
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:47.900]   There's some dissent over that, whether that actually happened that way.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:51.220]   Thanks to Andy Inako, and he'll be back on Tuesday hosting Mac Break Week.
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:54.860]   Oh, no, I guess I'll be here Tuesday, so I'll be with you on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:55.860]   Lovely.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:02.300]   I am leaving town because I'm going, you know, because it's Christmas.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.300]   There goes Andy.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.300]   There goes Nielei.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.300]   What's going on?
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.300]   Sorry.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.300]   He's getting taller.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:08.300]   Some folks get him taller.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.300]   Can we play the week ahead, but I'm going to say goodbye?
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:11.300]   Yes, yes.
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:13.700]   I was not going to let Tom get out of this.
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:17.660]   And I have some other things to tell you, including a very special event coming up on
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.660]   Tuesday.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:21.620]   Before that, though, let's find out what's coming up in the week ahead with Mr. Merritt.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:22.620]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:26.740]   Here's some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:31.940]   Monday, December 19th, Apple and HTC's patent ruling is supposed to come.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.940]   It's been delayed a couple of times.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.780]   We'll see if it actually happens on Monday.
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:39.060]   Tuesday, December 20th, Star Wars, the old Republic will launch for those who didn't get
[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:41.380]   early access in North America.
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:46.460]   On Wednesday, it looks like the House Judiciary Committee will open the markup session again
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:51.140]   on the Stop Online Piracy Act and Thursday, December 22nd, Star Wars, the old Republic
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.980]   will launch in Europe for those who didn't get early access.
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.580]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:56.580]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.140]   It's kind of a slow week because it's Christmas thing.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:02.220]   You know, really puts it, puts a crimp in Tech News.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:06.900]   And we, and for that reason, we will not be doing a show Christmas night.
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:09.220]   But we've got a very special Christmas episode.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.300]   We've done this in the past and it's so much fun.
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:18.260]   Tuesday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern, which is 2300, something like that, UTC.
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.420]   We will be doing our Christmas special.
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:26.060]   That's this Tuesday, which we will air on Sunday, Christmas night, with the esteemable
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:27.620]   John Hodgman.
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:31.940]   Or is it a stemable, a stem, estimable, estimable John Hodgman.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:34.100]   He's the PC in the Mac PC ads.
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:39.100]   And of course, his new book, That Is All, completes his trilogy of Everything You Ever
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.300]   Wanted to Know.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:44.740]   Jonathan Colton will join us to perform.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:46.460]   And Paul and Storm will be here.
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:50.540]   And Paul will reprise his famous "Yagermeister" episode.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.260]   That is coming up on Tuesday.
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:53.740]   And I'll bring you the bong.
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:54.740]   I'll be right back.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:57.340]   Well, we still have all the "Yagermeister" bottles.
[01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:58.340]   I know.
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.180]   It was all for show.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.180]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:04.660]   And I hope you'll join us for that special recording on Tuesday 4 p.m.
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:07.780]   I guess we might as well do the Christmas wraps live as well.
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.780]   Why not?
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:09.780]   Let's just turn the camera on.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:10.780]   I don't care.
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:13.780]   Anyway, next week, Best ofs, throughout most of our shows, although some of our shows
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:14.780]   will be live.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:19.980]   But we have, thanks to Eileen, really working hard, collating all the best of from previous
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:20.980]   shows.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:21.980]   And will we air that on New Year's?
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:22.980]   No, I'll be here for you.
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:24.380]   New Year's Day, we are planning Best of Twitch.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:25.380]   OK, good.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:26.380]   So we'll miss a couple.
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:29.380]   This is our last live "Twit of the Year."
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:30.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:31.380]   Wow.
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:33.580]   Well, Happy Hanukkah, everybody.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:34.580]   Merry Christmas.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:36.540]   A Happy New Year.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:41.460]   And we will be back on January 8th, which will be our pre-CES-Twit.
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.460]   Yep.
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.220]   So you're going to do the Verge at CES.
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.220]   What are you going to do at CES, Nila?
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.380]   Oh, we're blowing it out.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:49.460]   I think we're going to have some, like, 40 people there.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:50.460]   We have a new hour.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.820]   Are you going to do any live streaming?
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:56.460]   Yeah, we're going to do a podcast from the show floor every night.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:59.140]   We have a little stage area set up for us.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:03.540]   We have our trailer, our big double-wide trailer that we had in gadget and how we had one
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.540]   for the Verge.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:05.540]   That's good.
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.540]   There's going to be a little stage out in front of that.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:10.060]   And I think what we're going to do, we have a super session with some pretty interesting
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:13.300]   guests, a bunch of people from around mobile.
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:15.740]   Yeah, we're going at it full force.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:17.100]   It's getting crowded at CES.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.460]   There's a lot of people there.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.460]   We'll be there also.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.980]   Of course, we have our sky booth that really is only about eight inches off the ground.
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:26.940]   And we'll be there in the South Hall.
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.940]   It should be a lot of fun.
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:28.940]   That's going to be fun.
[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:31.140]   I'll tell you what, we'll do a trade.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:33.340]   Yeah, you come over and I'll visit your double-wide.
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:34.780]   That'd be great.
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:35.780]   Thank you.
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:36.780]   Thank you.
[02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:39.100]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.100]   Are you going to go to CES?
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.140]   I will be there for the whole week.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:43.140]   We're going to count on you, too.
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.140]   You've got to come over.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.140]   Absolutely.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.140]   Come to the double-wide.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:49.340]   No, come to our booth.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.340]   Sky booth.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.340]   Where would you rather be?
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:53.260]   A sky booth or a double-wide?
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:54.260]   I ask you.
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:57.060]   Depends on how high the sky booth is and how high is the double-wide?
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:58.060]   Eight inches.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.900]   And I'll bring the bomb.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:01.140]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:02.580]   We'll see you next time.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:03.580]   Happy New Year.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:04.580]   We'll see you next year.
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:05.580]   Another tweet is in the can.
[02:02:05.580 --> 02:02:05.580]   This is amazing.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.580]   I want a tweet.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.580]   I want a tweet.
[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:09.580]   I want a tweet.
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:19.700]   Alright.. Doin' The Twit. Baby..... Doin' The Twit... Alright... Doin' The Twit...
