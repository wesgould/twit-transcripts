[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.320]   He said the last conference.

[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.480]   We'll also talk about the E library that authors are saying
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.640]   shouldn't be giving away their books.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.480]   And e-sports is racing the next great e-sports?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.520]   Apparently so.

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.760]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.040]   to show where we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.880]   And we are all in our places with bright shining faces, safe
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.240]   and sound.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.560]   I am in my old school studio, so we're
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.400]   doing this kind of, for those of you watching, old school
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.840]   cottage style.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.040]   For those of you listening, shouldn't sound any different.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.640]   Let me welcome our guests today from left to right, Seth
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.280]   Rosenblatt.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.240]   Hi, Seth from theparallax.com.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.000]   How is it going?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's going, well, how is it going in your inner sanctum?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.320]   This is the same for me.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.360]   I self-quarantined five years ago.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.760]   And I work from home.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.720]   And the dog still needs to be taken out for runs.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.400]   And I'm just wondering where all these people came from.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Where are you located?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   I'm in San Francisco.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.160]   I'm near Golan Gate Park.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640]   I saw a video this morning drone footage
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   shot on Sunday, last Sunday of San Francisco.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   It's pretty quiet.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.240]   It's like Christmas plus Burning Man.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   Right.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.840]   Everybody went to the desert.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.240]   Also with us from CNET, Lexi Savidis,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.760]   it's so good to see you, Lexi.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.160]   How are you doing in this time, this troubled time?
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.800]   Yeah, I'm doing well.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   All things considered.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.840]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.560]   And we love having you on.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.440]   Yeah, this is my DIY studio room, fitness studio.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.200]   As you can see, menagerie of plants as well behind me.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.720]   So I'm really getting into the one room
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.600]   does everything spirit.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   So it's interesting to see how long it takes
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.960]   to go so crazy in here.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.520]   The Instapart style of broadcasting.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.160]   You put them all in one, but I have to say,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.880]   normally we have a lot of nerdy guys on.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.800]   You're the first to have actual plants in your studio.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.240]   That's really nice.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.600]   Living creatures in there.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.280]   Yeah, you know, it just makes me like,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.520]   I can see trees outside, but I'm not going outside.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.640]   Right.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.040]   So if you can't go outside, at least bring outside inside.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.960]   And it means the air and just, you know, makes me feel better.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.880]   So why not adopt a plant?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   Can't have a pet adopt a plant.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.760]   You're in San Francisco as well?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.240]   Yes, I am.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   And then we go all the way to--
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.480]   and he knows I'm going to say something weird--
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.440]   to come carry New Mexico.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.360]   I don't know where he is.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.640]   Yeah, you know, let's go.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.360]   We're going to go with that one.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.440]   Yeah, but maybe Barstow.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.120]   Barstow?
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.840]   He's coming to us from the painted desert.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   It's Ed Bot of the Ed Bot Report in ZDNet.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.920]   Good friend, longtime friend.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   He's been with us since the college days.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.920]   So this probably looks to you like it used to.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   Oh, this is giving me flashbacks here.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   And it is Santa Fe, New Mexico, up here at 7,000 feet,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.720]   where it's still winter.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.960]   So I've still got the winter flannels on.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.080]   Nice.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.880]   And as everybody knows, COVID doesn't live over 6,000 feet.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.200]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.680]   And you can use flannel as a face mask.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.120]   You know, that was one thing that really
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   started to bug me a little bit.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.280]   We had somebody in the chat room from Prague
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   in the Czech Republic.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   And unlike here in the US where we were told,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.040]   oh, masks don't help.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.040]   In Prague, they told everybody masks do help.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.200]   All the grandmas in Prague started home making masks,
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.920]   so much so that they--
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   and unlike Asia, there was no tradition
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.440]   of wearing masks in public.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.040]   But all the influencers started posting pictures
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.520]   of themselves in masks.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.680]   And now it's pretty much 100% in the Czech Republic.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.720]   They put masks on trees outside, so people,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.520]   if they didn't have a mask, they were making them out
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.000]   of t-shirts.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.400]   They weren't the N95 masks that the hospital technicians use.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.640]   But apparently, any mask is helpful.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.240]   Take it home at night, wash it, and make it out of a t-shirt
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.640]   and wear it the next day.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   And it's made a huge difference in the Czech Republic.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.880]   And it makes me a little mad that they said
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.760]   they were so anxious to keep these masks for medical personnel
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.200]   who obviously need them and there's a shortage,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.840]   that they kind of misrepresented the fact
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.680]   that masks can help, whether you're sick or not.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.640]   I mean, no doubt, like the big story coming out of this
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   is going to be the utter failure of all levels of government,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.880]   at least in the US, to effectively communicate
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.640]   what needs to be done to prevent people from getting sick,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.120]   how to prevent people who might be sick from spreading
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.320]   to others and how to treat the people who are sick.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   I mean, I think it's going to be the big scandal of the year,
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   presuming that we all make it through the year.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.280]   The good news is there seems--
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.520]   Not to beat a downer.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   Thanks a lot, Seth.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.520]   It does seem-- and I'll give you the upside of it.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   It does-- social distancing does seem to work.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.040]   And I know it's tough in New Orleans and New York City
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.480]   and Brooklyn, still hard in Seattle, Florida.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.000]   But in areas like this in Northern California
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.680]   where we've been-- we were the first to social distance
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.760]   in the US.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.720]   The sickness rates are way low.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.520]   And we know this thanks to an internet-connected thermometer
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.560]   from a company called Kinza Health, K-I-N-S-A.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.240]   I ordered one early on, and so I have it.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.120]   I take my temperature every day.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.840]   And their temperature map is not reliant on tests for COVID
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.560]   or anything like that.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.280]   It just shows areas where people's temperatures are higher.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.040]   Since they've been handing these out for six years
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.000]   to schools and so forth, they have more than a million
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.520]   out in the United States.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.080]   And I think it's very interesting.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.000]   I think this is one area where you're
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.640]   seeing a technology that's been kind of very helpful,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   additional information.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.920]   You see observed illness and atypical illness on their map,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.840]   which is at US health-- actually, it's healthweather.us.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.680]   And you can see where hotspots are atypical trends
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.880]   and observed.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.840]   And all of this comes from the map data.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.000]   But this is the graph I think is most interesting.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.160]   This is for the whole US, but you could do this county by county.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.920]   You see the blue line is what you'd expect from flu season,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.560]   typical illness.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   The orange line is observed illness,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.160]   which was until late February following that blue line.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.400]   But then started to go up.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.880]   And when you see it red, that's where it's higher than average.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.200]   But look at the precipitous drop, starting
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.760]   with general social distancing in March 19, March 20,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.200]   last week.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.160]   We're actually now well below what you'd
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.400]   expect for this time of year for flu season.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.800]   I think the--
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.000]   Right.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.680]   And people aren't getting the flu.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.780]   Or cold.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.320]   Or anything else, right?
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.800]   Right.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.840]   Right.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.440]   I think that's great.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.600]   You know, Zenep Tufceki has been doing some really excellent
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.560]   work the last couple of days and weeks in particular.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   And she's been really beating the drum
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.080]   on the need for people in the United States
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.240]   to get it together and start wearing masks when you go outside.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.720]   And the odd thing is that if you look at the data,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.840]   the countries that have been using masks across the board
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.320]   consistently and universally are among the most successful
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.760]   at managing the spread of the virus.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.320]   And one of the things that we did here, one of the many things
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.680]   that we did wrong here, was to sort of stigmatize
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.600]   the use of masks so that somebody who goes out wearing
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.640]   a mask is presumed to be sick.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.040]   And therefore, it can be--
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.640]   I mean, you're going to be shunned, which
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.200]   isn't the bad thing in today.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   We all want to be shunned now.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.680]   Right.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.760]   But you run the risk of being harassed or even assaulted
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.160]   if someone thinks that you're carrying germs, carrying
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   viruses into the environment.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.560]   So the sooner we can get to the point
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.200]   where it's nearly universal use of masks here,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   the better off we'll be.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   And I understand the surgeon general saying,
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.480]   don't buy masks, folks.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.000]   They don't help because they wanted
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.880]   to preserve these medical grade masks for the people
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.520]   who really need them.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.680]   Our hardworking medical and EMT folks
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.360]   and the first responders who are exposed every day--
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   boy, the statistics you see now about police officers
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.640]   and nurses and EMTs come down with COVID
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.560]   because they don't have enough protective gear are tragic.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.520]   So I understand their motivation.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.800]   But maybe it would have been better to be a little bit more
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.560]   honest because as they've done in Czech Republic,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.880]   you can make masks out of a T-old T-shirt.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.960]   It doesn't have to be a medical grade mask.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.560]   And even that will help keep you from touching your face
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.240]   at the very least.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.000]   Certainly the early advice for medical professionals
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.200]   to only wear a mask if you showed symptoms
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.480]   has been shown to be a real error in judgment.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.000]   Right.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   Because you can still spread it if you're asymptomatic.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.560]   And that's the problem.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   People don't know if they're sick.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.760]   And I want to quickly circle back to what you said
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.600]   about whether or not we're doing the right thing
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.360]   in here in Northern California, where
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.600]   we were the earliest municipality in the country
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.160]   to adopt a shelter-in-place regulation.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.240]   Medical professionals were saying--
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.280]   and public health officials were saying earlier this
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.440]   at the end of last week-- is that this coming week
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.320]   is going to be the real point where we're going
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   to tell, because this is the two-week mark
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720]   from the shelter-in-place.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.080]   We should see people who were asymptomatic two weeks ago
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960]   start to develop symptoms.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.640]   And they're predicting a huge spike
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:44.400]   in positive COVID-19 infections and all of the difficulties
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.160]   that will come with that.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   So I would love to think that here in the Bay Area,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.640]   we're doing better than others.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.480]   But I'm not convinced.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.680]   That's where we are yet.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.280]   Then there's the issue of using--
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.080]   so there's some benefits to things like Kinsa Health.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   There's some additional information
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.800]   you can get from these--
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.160]   Bluetooth and internet-connected thermometers.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.720]   But then there's some disturbing news.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.920]   Jeffrey Fowler wrote about it in the Washington Post today
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.120]   that some companies, including, I think, the CDC
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.520]   and other health authorities, are using advertisements
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   to track us to--
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.800]   so they're buying ads which send back geolocation information.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.400]   And as a result, they are knowing where people are congregating,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.480]   not congregating.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.120]   Does that worry anybody, the idea that perhaps we're
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   entering a surveillance system?
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   And this is what happens when you have a crisis,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.880]   is as it happened with 9/11 and the Patriot Act,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.720]   you suspend our traditional rights to solve a crisis.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.520]   But does it concern you that all of a sudden
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.200]   the cell phone location information,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.240]   which we've been battling over for the last few years anyway,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.400]   is being used in this way?
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.200]   What about Ulexi?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.920]   Is this something that concerns you?
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.880]   Yeah, I mean, I think anyone who has been following this
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.360]   for any time in terms of all the implications
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.280]   that this might have, as you just said,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.240]   with enacting anything in the Patriot Act kind of way,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.920]   or just in the time of an emergency
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.560]   to think that what will happen when this is all over
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.080]   and be able to roll back the things that have been implemented
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.440]   in terms of tracking.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.320]   I mean, I've been thinking about this a lot,
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   the ways to circumvent it, obviously.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.840]   Like, if you have to go outside,
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.000]   if you are going to be flagrantly,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   you're going against regulations,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.040]   like you would leave your phone at home,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.440]   turn on airplane mode, things like that.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.400]   But I just--
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.800]   But this information's useful.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.280]   And we kind of want to help, right?
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.840]   So apparently the government has been in talks with Facebook
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.960]   and Google and other companies about how they can use location
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   data to combat the virus.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.640]   Then they're buying ads because it turns out,
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.600]   oh, what a surprise.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.040]   Those ads tell you where--
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.240]   tell the buyer where their viewers are,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.600]   and they're aggregating this.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.280]   On the one hand, I think it's great if it helps us beat the virus.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.800]   Is it a--
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.840]   But is it a bad precedent?
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.680]   So you're saying, Lexi, are you turning off your location
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.360]   information when you go out?
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   Well, I'm not going out.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:34.960]   That's the thing.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Good, good.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.440]   Thank you.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:36.960]   Good.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   That don't want to be misinterpreted.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.400]   I'm definitely not leaving the house without an absolute necessity.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.240]   But just thinking about the ways that this
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.400]   is going to have implications if this continues to happen
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.240]   after the crisis is over.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.640]   And as you say, you want anything-- any data
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.880]   that we have access to now to help stop the spread of this.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.800]   But once this is said and done to continue
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.520]   to have this monitoring, this tracking,
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.600]   through advertising, through whatever it might be,
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.720]   through data from cellular providers,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.800]   or even from the phone manufacturers too,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.440]   there's a lot to think about in terms of the trade-offs
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.480]   that have to be made here.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   And it's scary enough thinking about the situation
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.160]   that we are all currently facing with the virus,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.880]   let alone the data protection stuff
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.640]   that we also have to add on top of it.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.080]   Seth, you're a security guru.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Does it worry you?
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.800]   And I think it's a lot of smoke and mirrors at this point.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.160]   Fewer than 50% of the states in the US
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.400]   have shelter-in-place orders or similar at this point.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   Certainly municipalities have been better about it,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.760]   but not all of them have.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.960]   And I can't remember which state, but one of them,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.040]   even the governor decided to declare that municipalities
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.600]   couldn't enforce shelter-in-place laws that were regulations
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.440]   that were stricter than the ones that the state had.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.680]   I think that was a tendency, I think.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.040]   It was some place with a lot of gun stores, I think.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.840]   And I mean--
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.920]   Oh.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.240]   Oh, was that on to on the point?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.720]   So I feel like sure if we are struggling
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.040]   to prevent people from going out, yes, location data
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.400]   could be helpful, but we're not even--
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.960]   We're trying to--
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.600]   We're trying to--
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.100]   That's running.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.760]   That's running.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.560]   We're not even crawling at this point.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.160]   And I think that this is going to be just seeing
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.720]   the patterns of how people got infected in China, in Italy,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.040]   in other places where it was really severe.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.440]   Suddenly, what we're doing in the US is nothing.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   I mean, we have more cases in the US,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.560]   more positive coronavirus cases in the US than China has.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.120]   Has had this entire time.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.480]   Although--
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.800]   This is going to--
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.300]   This is going to--
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.040]   Is what China's numbers--
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.800]   Sure, sure.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.360]   Even if even if China's suppressing their numbers,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.400]   it's a very bad exponential increase here in the US.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   As an example, South Korea--
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.080]   The location stuff is scary.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.160]   Yeah, China's used it.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.480]   South Korea's used it.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.120]   Apparently, with great effect, they had an app
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.920]   to attract people and will alert authorities
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.880]   if they left home.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.760]   You know?
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   Well--
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.800]   And that's what you really--
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.000]   I mean, if you're going to use location data as a way
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.640]   to manage public behavior, then be transparent about it.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.000]   One of the things that the countries that have been
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.520]   successful with this have been doing, as you mentioned there,
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.880]   is that the big thing they've been doing is contact tracing.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.680]   So that if you can use that location data to say,
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.360]   this person was very near a person who was infected--
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   Right.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:02.880]   Sure.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   --then you can quarantine those people
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.840]   until it's clear that they either are infected or aren't.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.240]   And you can stop the spread that way.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.360]   So that's what--
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:23.720]   But this weird-ass idea that you can sneak in
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.680]   and grab a bunch of location data from advertising
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.360]   that's going to be blocked by a bunch of people anyway,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   it's only a concern--
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.040]   That would be my concern, is that people's knee-jerk reaction
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.120]   might be shut this stuff down to leave their phones
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.280]   at home and so forth.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.480]   So the idea that this is going to do any good--
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:49.160]   I mean, I think it has a whiff of desperation to it.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.800]   Maybe let's gather this information
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.440]   and see if we can use it for something later.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.760]   Maybe the data will be useful.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.000]   And that's kind of been the way that online advertising has
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.920]   worked for the last few years.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   Let's collect everything because maybe we
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.200]   don't know how much of it's going to be useful.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.040]   This is a company called Unicast.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.160]   They get location data from games, social media apps,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.600]   5,000 different apps people install.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.040]   And they actually have a location data tool kit
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.080]   and a social distancing scoreboard
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   so that you can get a score about how well you're
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.600]   doing in social distancing in the country.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.840]   Session end by server.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.480]   I guess I'm going to get a new session here.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.960]   The top states, according to this,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.120]   are D.C., Alaska, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.000]   The bottom states are Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.800]   You don't need to do social distancing in Montana
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.560]   and Wyoming.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.600]   There's nobody there.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.760]   So what is that?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.000]   Part of the problem is that the data here
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.040]   doesn't seem to appear to have a lot of connection
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.440]   to positive cases.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.960]   New York, we know, has the highest number
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.520]   of positive coronavirus cases in the country.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.240]   And yet they're also excelling at social distancing.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.200]   So it would seem to imply that social distancing doesn't work.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.880]   But we know that it works because we've
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   seen it work in other places.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.000]   So this kind of data flimflamory, I think,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.160]   is really bad for people.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.920]   Is that a technical term?
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.600]   It's a good term.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.640]   I like flimflamory.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:33.320]   Of course, when this is going to really be useful and important
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.920]   and maybe even we'll all give permission to do this,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.320]   since we're not going to have herd immunity or a vaccine
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.200]   for another year at least, what's
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.280]   going to happen when social distancing works and ends
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.680]   in some number of months?
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.280]   The only thing you can do is what South Korea is doing
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.560]   at this point, which is now you've
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   got to track positive tests.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.880]   You've got to test all the time, track positive tests,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.600]   and be very aggressive with those.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.800]   Go back to the containment strategy
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.880]   that we never pursued here in the US.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.760]   That's what we're going to have to do for the next year.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.840]   Once we can get this thing under control,
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.360]   and that's when these apps are going to really be useful.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.440]   My guess is companies like Unicast,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.680]   which they've long been selling this information
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.440]   for other reasons, the real reason they're doing this
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.120]   is they see an opportunity in the coming months.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.960]   And I'm not sure it's a bad thing.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.440]   Shouldn't we use technology to save us?
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.880]   To solve this?
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.280]   Transparently.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.840]   I like that.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   You're right.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.840]   You've got to let people know you're doing it, and why.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   And yeah, yeah.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.720]   Just close up front.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.200]   Here's what we're doing.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.600]   Here's why it's important for you to opt in to it.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.360]   And here's where your data is, and here's how--
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.920]   and here are the judgments and activities
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.360]   that we've taken in response to that data.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.040]   If you have that kind of transparency,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.840]   I think you can go a long ways towards getting rid
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.320]   of people's trepidation about it.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.720]   I feel good about-- so this is interesting,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.040]   because of course, this all happened
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.240]   in the middle of this debate over how big tech is getting
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.960]   too big, and privacy, and security concerns.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.520]   This is a big debate that's been going on
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.280]   for the last couple of years.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.040]   Some say companies like Amazon are jumping on the bandwagon.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.960]   They're taking advantage of this to consolidate power.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.840]   Others say-- and I'm not sure which camp I fall in.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.360]   I'm curious what you all think.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.000]   Others say, no, the tech companies
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.920]   are stepping forward to help.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.000]   Apple's making a COVID-19 site.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.320]   Amazon's hired 100,000 people to help deliver products.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.880]   In fact, many of us are relying on Amazon
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.760]   just to keep stuff we need in stock.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.520]   Walmart's hired 150,000 people.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.080]   Maybe these aren't the best jobs in the world,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.280]   but they're jobs, and there's so many people out of work
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.880]   in the restaurant industry and in the service industries.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   Are tech companies-- are saviors?
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.280]   Or are they taking advantage of this opportunity?
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.520]   Or both?
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.440]   Definitely both.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.240]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.000]   I mean, up until this point, if you
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.600]   looked at the surveys of people's attitudes towards big tech,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.000]   they were generally getting more and more negative.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I think right now--
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I think we feel better about them now, don't we?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.960]   Well, we feel better about them right now,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.800]   because it's all we can do.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.120]   It's the only part of the economy that
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.200]   is still functioning, the physical economy.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.400]   Restaurants are shut down, nonessential businesses
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.120]   are shut down.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.640]   Yeah, but if it weren't for door stash,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.200]   I wouldn't have had takeout last night.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.520]   And I want to get takeout, because I
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.760]   want to support my local restaurants.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.280]   So--
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.760]   So--
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.320]   Yes.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.920]   And those door dashes, by the way, Monday,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.840]   they're all going on strike.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.320]   Is it door dashes or Instacart?
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.840]   Instacart's going on strike.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   Well, yeah, if they don't have coronavirus,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.960]   yet they will soon.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.600]   I mean, I think this is one of the massive problems
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.760]   that faces a lot of capitalist-based societies in the world.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.240]   But certainly here in the US, where
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.080]   we have a Federal Reserve to back up the banking system,
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.520]   which is fine, and it's actually worked fairly well
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.400]   over the past--
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.800]   however long, 80 years or so without--
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.640]   I don't want to trigger too many of our libertarian friends,
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.680]   but it has worked.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.920]   We don't have something similar for health care.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   We don't have something similar for unemployment.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.880]   In the US, you need to be working for, I think,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.400]   it's two years before you qualify for unemployment insurance.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.000]   And these days, who does that?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.560]   For one thing, who has an employer,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.120]   a single employer for two years straight,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.080]   very few of us relatively?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.360]   And then how many of us are with the same one for two years
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.080]   straight is another nail in the coffin.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.000]   So you're going to find a ton of people
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.680]   with no money, no way to support themselves,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.440]   no way to pay for their even their rent.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.720]   And while in California and a few other places,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.520]   they've announced a moratorium on evictions
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.240]   that that shit is going to come due as soon
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.280]   as the moratorium gets lifted.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.200]   How are people going to be detained?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.440]   Yeah, where's that money going to come from?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.400]   You even talked about at the top of the show
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   that you had to do five layoffs, or whatever it was.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.520]   No, we did.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.400]   It's brutal.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.680]   It's really, really brutal.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.960]   And without the proper safety nets, people,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.400]   I don't know what people are going to do.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.640]   And we need the health insurance safety net.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.480]   We need to have some sort of publicly funded
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.880]   healthcare for all kind of thing,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.240]   where, especially when there's a disaster like this,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.520]   going forward, people can get the care they need.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.840]   You don't want people who have symptoms
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.800]   or asymptomatic, but infected,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.560]   wandering around and infecting others.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.720]   That's what God is here.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.320]   Deep philosophical question.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.040]   Here's a deep philosophical question.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   No, I think what happens is the cracks in the system
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.680]   don't show up till it's stressed.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.480]   It's like a bridge.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.440]   You can drive over it day after day,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.040]   and it might even have some cracks in it,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.280]   but there's an earthquake,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.080]   then you know if that bridge is solid.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.400]   We, even you and I,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.080]   who are a little older than these youngsters
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.640]   on the right there, have never lived
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.960]   through anything like this.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.480]   It's our parents and grandparents
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.600]   who lived through World War II,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.480]   perhaps, that were the last people
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.640]   who really lived through a great national crisis.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.120]   I guess, you could say 9/11 was,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.000]   it was certainly an emotional crisis for us,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.840]   but except for New York City,
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.680]   it wasn't something that impacted us directly.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.200]   It was an indirect thing.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   This has been our, you know, great come to Jesus moment.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.960]   And I think it was,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.880]   we're gonna be very different coming out of this.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.400]   Whenever we do in six months, three months a year,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.640]   whatever it takes.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.480]   It's gonna be a different,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.200]   if it's gonna be a different society, is it not?
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.960]   Can I offer one slight...
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.800]   Correct.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.960]   Amendment to what you said there.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.960]   The, you said, we didn't see the cracks in the system
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.320]   until it was under stress.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.520]   There are a whole bunch of people
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.680]   who have been feeling and seeing
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.040]   and experiencing that stress in the system
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.560]   for many years.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.400]   No, that's true.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.080]   But they are from groups of people
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   that don't have any political power.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   Right.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.600]   That are, you know, they're economically disadvantaged,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.040]   politically disadvantaged, socially disadvantaged.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.720]   They might as well be invisible.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.320]   And what's happening now is that the things
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.960]   that were happening to those groups of people
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   are now bubbling up into the middle class.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.240]   To everyday working people.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   And now we're worried.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.560]   And now we're pissed.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.640]   And so there's a whole bunch of people who are going,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.680]   I've been trying to tell you this for years.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.360]   And here we are.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.640]   That's an excellent point.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.480]   Ed Bot.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.040]   I mean, I think it's more than just disadvantaged groups.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   I mean, when a GoFundMe is considered a viable option
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.920]   for paying for healthcare by vast number of states.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.520]   And that's not the new, by the way.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   That's been going on for years.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.520]   It's insane.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.840]   This is an insane system.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.760]   It's been broken.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.000]   The middle class has known it's been broken.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.080]   The less economically advantaged have known it's been broken
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.760]   for a very, very long time.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.240]   It's not going to get any better
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.400]   without fundamental systemic changes.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.680]   And, you know, in a situation like what we have,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.120]   we can't, as much as we, you know, on the left side
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.680]   of the political spectrum would like to blame only Trump,
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.720]   we clearly can't.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.360]   It's clearly been a failure of political will
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.640]   up and down the board.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.440]   You know, when cases were spreading,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   why did Washington state not have a shelter-in-place order?
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.560]   Why was Mayor de Blasio in New York City
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.120]   encouraging people to go out in the middle of February
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.600]   and do social activities when they knew
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   that coronavirus cases were happening and spreading?
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.080]   I mean, it's just, it's been a massive loss of failure.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.920]   Failure, yeah.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.480]   Yeah, good point.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.560]   And I don't want to make this the COVID-19 show,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.400]   but it's kind of hard to talk about the new iPad.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.800]   What, when we're, you know, clearly as a nation
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.200]   going through some difficult times,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.080]   does that make it hard, Lexi, to do your job?
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.240]   I mean, it just seems, I can't work out whether it's like,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.680]   obviously, you know, companies have got product roadmaps
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   and they have things in the pipeline.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.600]   And we, you know, we've seen, you know, iPad, MacBook,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.360]   Huawei P40, all those products launched in the past week
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.200]   and a half.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.480]   And, you know, these have been in the works
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.120]   for months and months and months.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.080]   So I was reading an interview with a Huawei CEO who said
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   that, you know, manufacturing, it was,
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.440]   basically started in, you know, the end of 2019,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.520]   like in quarter four.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.440]   So, you know, what do you do in that situation?
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.640]   So I do understand from the sense that, yes,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.600]   these products are just sitting there, they're waiting.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.560]   So why not launch a product?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.760]   But then it also does seem kind of tone-deaf
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   to especially launch a product that is incredibly expensive.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.920]   And, you know, none of the things that we've seen
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.320]   in the past couple of weeks have been particularly affordable.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.440]   People are losing jobs.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.440]   People are just, you know, struggling to work out,
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.680]   just what we were talking about before,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   what we're going to do in terms of healthcare,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.360]   you know, unemployment benefits.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.440]   And then have a big Ritzy product launch
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   to bring that through a live stream or a press release.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.600]   It feels a little tone-deaf, doesn't it?
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.560]   It's very difficult to reconcile as someone who covers this
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.760]   as, you know, their job.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.480]   I don't get involved in the political elements of tech
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.040]   or like anything like that.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   But it is kind of hard to go, hang on a minute.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.800]   Maybe I shouldn't be, you know,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.640]   saying how great XYZ product is or testing it out
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.680]   because the reality is like who is going to be using it,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.400]   a very select portion of people.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.680]   And that is just a difficult thing.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.480]   I'm struggling with it every day, you know.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.120]   How do you cover things in a way that is sensitive,
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.640]   but it's also informative for the people
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.680]   that want to know about it too.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   - The, some say the fall of the Roman Empire occurred
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.040]   because of a pandemic that raged through much
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.160]   of Europe, the Antonine Plague in 165 to 180 AD.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.280]   It certainly hastened the fall.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.200]   And that's where I wanted to get philosophic is.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   Sometimes these systems kind of lurch on for a while,
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   but when a, but these crises often trigger
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.320]   a complete sea change.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   Do you think that in a year that our society is going to go,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.800]   bounce, snap back, everything will be normal,
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.360]   restaurants will be open, we're going out and playing soccer,
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.040]   the movie theaters will be full,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   or we'll be, we'll be emerge kind of into the sunlight,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.800]   bleary-eyed, into a brave new world.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.200]   - Hey, it's such a tough question.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.480]   And I don't know the answer.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   - There's no right answer, but I'm just curious, yeah.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.520]   - That's the thing.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   I mean, you'd have to hope.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.840]   I mean, I'm an optimist in the sense that I hope
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   that we can take the situation and what we learn from it
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.320]   and use things going forward to not just have a collective
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.360]   memory that just forgets what's happened.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.600]   I mean, I think this is really going to have the,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.840]   I think the next week, two weeks, three weeks, month
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.200]   is really going to have the biggest impact
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.960]   into how we collectively remember and how we also
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.080]   are able to go forward.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.280]   And, you know, are we going to be able to go back
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.240]   to life as normal?
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.080]   Are people going to handshake?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.040]   Are people going to go to big conferences?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.000]   I was just thinking, like, how do we, you know,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.800]   tech conferences, thousands and thousands of people
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.680]   often at many of them, are they going to continue as is?
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.360]   Or are we going to transition to something that is more
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.320]   a hybrid online slash maybe a smaller event in person,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.000]   product briefings, how is this all going to happen?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.840]   I don't know.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.680]   I would hope that we take some learnings and go,
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.240]   maybe we don't need a conference where 500,000 people
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.760]   from all around the world converge into one space.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.960]   Maybe we don't need that anymore.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.920]   Maybe there's a smarter way to do it,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.560]   not just because we don't want it.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.680]   You know, we obviously don't want to have the risk
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.640]   of a virus or another infectious disease transmitting,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.720]   but also maybe there's an environmental cost of flying
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.080]   in 500,000 people from all around the world.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.400]   Maybe, you know, there's another aspect to it as well.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.600]   So I am really interested to see what happens.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.360]   I just hope that we can also, you know,
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.960]   it doesn't end up being, we just forget what happened
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.440]   and life goes back to normal.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.280]   - I kind of, yeah.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.480]   - People don't just go to massive pool parties
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   in Las Vegas and celebrate the end of COVID.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.400]   I mean, as fun as those might be.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   - So what I've been reading about best case scenarios
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.160]   are that whenever areas decide to lift their shelter
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.440]   in place orders, it'll be because there's been a drop
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.640]   in the number of positive coronavirus cases.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.960]   But what's going to wind up happening is those cases
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.920]   are going to come back because the actual period of time
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.400]   is going to take us to develop some kind of vaccine
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.480]   or preventative is going to, you know,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.320]   and have it approved and run through tests
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.440]   and not kill people.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.640]   You don't want the, the latter my babies.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.880]   I mean, there are real concerns here.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.040]   So it, we're probably looking at 18 months, right?
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.240]   12 to 18 months of rolling shelter in place orders.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.320]   I mean, I think that anyone who sounds
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.160]   any kind of optimistic tone regarding when this is going to end
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.280]   is better, they better be an epidemiologist
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.080]   and have access to a lot of research
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.200]   because I don't think it's anywhere.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.280]   - No one knows.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   - And we just saw in San Francisco, the schools announced
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.360]   that they are staying closed until May 1st
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.600]   beyond the shelter in place order.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.360]   What's going to happen to their parents?
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.320]   They have to stay home.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.720]   I think this is going to be,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.280]   this is going to take us all a real long time.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.760]   - I hope Brian, I hope things inch.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.200]   - Brian X Chen took a little heat
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.800]   'cause he did a piece in the New York Times
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   about how to get on those business conference calls.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.000]   And one of the things he says is don't let your kids
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.360]   in the room and whatever you do,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.320]   don't have your pets in the room with you.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.120]   And I just, I think those of us who've been doing this
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.680]   for some time, those are the highlights.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.560]   The highlights of any show when the kid comes in the room
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.080]   or the pet jumps in the lap.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   That's what we want to see.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.240]   That's what we need, the humanity of it.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.120]   - You know, I have a slightly different take
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.160]   on the philosophical question.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   I agree with the others, but I have a different aspect
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.360]   to look at of it.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   I grew up, my parents were born in the depths
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.800]   of the depression early 1930s.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.840]   My grandparents were born at the turn of the century.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.720]   - By the way, we all have family members who were
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.320]   and they are scarred by it, right?
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.680]   Many of them carry those scarves.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.160]   - And that's the point that I want to make.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   They had, not just scarring,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.240]   but it changed the way they approached the world.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   They changed their feeling about money and food
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.840]   and physical goods.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.960]   They always felt like scarcity.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.200]   - It was always a shortage.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.040]   - Yep.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.760]   - Was just around the corner and so you had to be thrifty
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   and you had to be frugal.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.560]   And so I'm not sure what, I am positive
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.960]   there will be something similar in the generation
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.560]   that is living through this now.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.960]   I think there's going to be a sort of,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.680]   there's a lingering, gonna be a fear of people.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.920]   - I'm never going to CES again.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.240]   - There's going to be a fear.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.080]   - I'm not gonna be here.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.400]   - Yeah, like, you should have been going
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.560]   in the first place.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.400]   - Yeah.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.880]   - We died such a bullet.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   It was January, we had 180,000 geeks all in the same place.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.200]   A bunch of people from China,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.840]   I don't know how it didn't get started there.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.720]   - We used to joke about the CES flu.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.920]   - Yes, we don't get sick.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.520]   - Everyone would get sick, you know, it was,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.720]   and eventually that's why I stopped going to CES.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.640]   But I think you're gonna see that.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.360]   I think that's going to be the lingering takeaway
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.680]   from all this is a sort of a palpable fear
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.200]   of other people and even a fear like,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.480]   "Okay, well, we get this one.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   "We figure out how to deal with this one,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "but is there another one right around the corner?"
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.680]   - We are gonna be, and somebody called it
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.320]   the C generation, generation C.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.600]   We are gonna be the generation that our kids
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.440]   and grandkids will say, "God, Grandpa
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.600]   "washes his hands all the time."
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.360]   Grandpa always uses a towel to open the door.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.600]   What's that all about?
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.400]   You know, I mean, honestly, we're shell-shocked,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.720]   we're traumatized, I'm traumatized already.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.560]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.160]   Do you dream at night about viruses?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.200]   I do, all the time.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.120]   - Well, computer viruses, but that's part of the job.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.240]   - You've always dreamt about those, Seth.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.600]   - Right, do you want me to mention
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.000]   that I attended the last conference stand?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.480]   - RSA, did you go to RSA?
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.160]   - No, I did go to RSA, but that's 'cause I'm here
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.880]   and it's pretty hard to avoid the gravity of that.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.000]   But about a week and a half ago, I went up to Cansack West.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.800]   - But you, wait a minute, I thought that was all virtual.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.520]   - It was, but he still held the physical portion of it.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.640]   Cansack is a 20-year-old hacker conference
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.560]   in Vancouver, for those who don't know.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.240]   And it tends to focus on very technical talks.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.720]   And I've been going up for several years covering it
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   and the founder and host, Drago S. Ruwe,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   said he was still going to do a physical conference
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.720]   and I said I gotta go up and see what this is like.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.360]   - Did you wear a mask?
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.960]   - Yeah, I mean, it was actually really remarkable.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.560]   There were three attendees,
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.040]   so there were about 36 feet per person.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.880]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute, three, one to three.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   - Three people showed up in person.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.040]   - Wow.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.280]   - 100, he had about 180 plus at the peak of the livestream.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   So that's about 40% of his regular in-person attendees.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.440]   So he was happy about that.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.960]   But he provided four head thermometers.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.120]   So I checked my temperature three times a day.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.360]   There were plenty of face masks
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.080]   because as the coronavirus pandemic spread,
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.920]   he came up with a series of different things to do
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.960]   before people started dropping out entirely.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.360]   So one of them was to provide multiple masks
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.160]   for every attendee,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   which he told me he would donate all the leftovers
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.600]   to local hospitals in Vancouver.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.880]   There were more hand sanitizer stations
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.920]   than there were people on hand.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.520]   He had about a half, it was him
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.560]   and less than a half dozen other people
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.280]   making sure the streams were all working
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.160]   and these three attendees and myself.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.880]   But I asked him, I said, why?
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.400]   This is all great, but you could be doing this
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.600]   from the comfort of your home.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.160]   Why are you doing this in person at all?
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.960]   And he said, we have relationships,
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.200]   and also keep in mind this is a week and a half ago.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.680]   So things had certainly gotten a lot worse elsewhere
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.520]   since then, but he said, we have relationships
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.000]   with the hotel, with caters, with people.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.320]   And he wanted to make sure
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.160]   that he maintained that community.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.400]   - That's reasonable.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.880]   And I think that because there were so few people in person
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.600]   that was actually, I don't know that
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   that was the call I personally would make,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.360]   but I can see why he made that call
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.120]   and I respect him for feeling like people
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.200]   were gonna be really hard up.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.760]   - They did pwned on virtually,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.320]   which I think was kind of cool.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.880]   They had the hackers send in their attacks.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.280]   We actually, we'll talk about the way to get back
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.120]   'cause you got to see that in person.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.800]   - Yeah.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   I feel like at least the generation
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.040]   that's lived through this,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.480]   we're gonna have a very different idea
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.640]   about what's a healthy thing to do.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.840]   Like, conferencing, I don't know
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   if the cruise industry is gonna recover.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.320]   I used to like to go on cruises.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:29.160]   Airplanes are flying pretty much empty.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.320]   They're still flying, but they're pretty much empty.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.840]   - Johnny Jet, my travel guy, told me yesterday
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.000]   on the radio show, you can get a round trip
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.640]   from San Francisco to Miami for $40.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.480]   Shall we go?
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.640]   - No.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.680]   (laughs)
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.240]   - $40.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.080]   It's cheap.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:52.960]   I mean, I was talking with the stewards on the flight
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.160]   that I was on up to Vancouver and back.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.040]   It's less than two and a half hours from SF.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   None of them were required to wear gloves or face masks.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:11.000]   I think they had just been allowed the option
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   of wearing gloves per United on my return flight,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.720]   which was on the 20th.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.840]   I feel really, really bad for anybody in those situations
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.520]   where their employers are not allowing them
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.640]   to take sensible precautions.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.400]   There's a lot of people and again,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.880]   I'm very grateful for the people who are on the front lines
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.160]   and it's not just the nurses and doctors.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.640]   It's the people stocking the grocery stores for minimum wage,
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.320]   but without them we'd have no food.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.560]   I mean, it's the door dash and the Instacart
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.840]   and it's funny you can't get,
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.640]   I was really annoyed because Whole Foods here,
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.360]   you go through Amazon, but they don't say anything.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.560]   Put the whole list together, grocery list together.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.920]   Do the whole process and at the very end,
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   you pick your delivery window, there are none available.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.200]   At the end of this like half hour of shopping,
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.400]   kind of imagining all the wonderful produce
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.880]   I'm gonna be getting, there are none available,
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.600]   but we add more all the time.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.120]   So I'm sitting there refreshing all day,
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.480]   trying to get a delivery and yet I understand
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.920]   that that's a risky job being a picker
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.960]   for Amazon, for Whole Foods for Instacart.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.160]   That's a risky job.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.720]   And so thank you for doing that.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.120]   - And it's not just Amazon and other services
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.000]   that are experiencing those kind of delays,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.440]   all sorts of grocery delivery services.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.160]   - I can't get groceries.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   - I think there's so few that the smaller ones seem
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.080]   to be having a slightly more luck,
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.400]   at least in the Bay Area, but it's just very difficult.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.840]   The demand is just through the roof
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.520]   and I just hope that people are hoarding unnecessarily.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.320]   It's because there are people that are
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.120]   in more disadvantaged situations
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.520]   that just can't afford to buy
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.320]   four to $500 worth of groceries in one whole.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.880]   They have to shop week.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.960]   - Imagine if we didn't, I mean,
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.760]   we at least have this infrastructure.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.840]   10 years ago, it wouldn't have existed.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.040]   I mean, and it would have been a very different experience.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.880]   Let me take a break.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.040]   There's a lot more to talk about
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.840]   and it's not gonna be the COVID show we'll find.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.400]   (laughs)
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.280]   - Little late for that.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.840]   - It's getting harder, I'll be honest.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.680]   I never wanted to do the COVID show.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.520]   We're a tech network.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.800]   We wanted to talk about tech,
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.640]   but it's getting hard.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.040]   There's less and less tech news all the time
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.720]   and there's a lot of COVID news.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.920]   Certainly there's an intersection between tech and COVID.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.320]   So I apologize if I know there are people who say,
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.440]   I don't need to hear anymore about this.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   Go play Uno.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.520]   We're gonna do something else.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.920]   - Solitaire.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.400]   - Solitaire, yeah, maybe.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.360]   I feel bad for anybody.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.240]   Any of you sheltering in place alone?
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.080]   - No, I got lucky.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.640]   My girlfriend moved in February 1st.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.360]   - See, you're thankful now.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.240]   - Not just me and roommate and the dog.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.080]   - Thankful now.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.440]   - And the girlfriend and the roommate.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.920]   - That would be really, I feel,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.400]   I know there are many people doing that.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.560]   That would be hard.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.440]   My son just got back from,
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.680]   he was on a three months kind of,
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.600]   I don't know, grand tour of Asia.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.960]   Ended up in Bali and finally realized,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.520]   you know, maybe I'd get better get out of here.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.920]   Finally got home and he's gonna be quarantined
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.680]   for two weeks all by himself.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.040]   But I'll wave at him through the window or something.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.880]   I said, do you need anything?
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.320]   He said, "Playstation 4, please."
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.160]   (laughing)
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.480]   I have a three, will that do?
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.320]   Our show today, we thank also,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.000]   we thank very much our sponsors,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.800]   the people who make this week in tech possible
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.320]   and especially wanna thank LastPass,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.680]   which I know you guys all are well aware of,
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.080]   LastPass is the password manager
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   I've been using for a decade now
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.160]   and good friends of the network.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.720]   Thank you for sponsoring the LastPass studio
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.640]   and thank you for keeping the lights on here
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.560]   at this weekend tech.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.160]   And if you are a business
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.880]   and you've got people working from home,
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.720]   if you aren't using LastPass,
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.760]   you're probably wondering, oh boy,
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.520]   what are we gonna do now?
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.200]   LastPass protects your remote workforce
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.960]   and more importantly, maybe from your point,
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.200]   if you protects your business,
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.920]   very important to keep security top of mind
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.600]   and also I would say as important
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.920]   without impinging on employee productivity.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   Transitioning to a full work from home environment
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.160]   can be a lot less complicated with LastPass.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.880]   They can make that transition much simpler,
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.040]   much cleaner, much faster without reducing security.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.080]   For one thing, we gotta be aware of an uptick
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.040]   in phishing attacks.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.440]   This is going crazy right now.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.720]   Coronavirus websites, I just saw a stat,
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.320]   something like 60,000 new fake websites created
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.920]   with phishing attacks,
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.320]   built in attacks on those websites,
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.400]   email, phishing, email, spear phishing, email.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.720]   LastPass reduces the risk of phishing schemes
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.200]   because it won't auto fill passwords
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.960]   on a suspicious website.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.240]   And you can set up LastPass, we do it,
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.280]   so that your employees don't actually have the password.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.200]   So if they accidentally open an email,
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.760]   it says fill in the log into the bank account,
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.120]   they don't know, they can't and LastPass won't fill that in.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.440]   If you've got remote employees accessing your corporate VPN,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.760]   LastPass adds a critical additional layer of security
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.360]   directly to your VPN through biometric
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.280]   multi-factor authentication.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.920]   It's biometric because of course, face ID or touch ID,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.080]   but they also use additional authentication factors,
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.440]   IP address, geo location, things like that,
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.240]   to make sure that the right people
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.000]   are logging into your bank account,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.640]   not the wrong people.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.920]   Regardless of when or how your employees need access,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.400]   LastPass ensures your employees have secure access
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.920]   to the work applications they need,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.480]   they've got single sign on, which employees love.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.120]   It's better than a password, it's easier,
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.000]   but it's more secure from your point of view.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Of course, LastPass is the best password manager out there.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And they offer an offline mode for both password management
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.560]   and multi-factor authentication.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.080]   So even if your employees are not able to get online,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.720]   they haven't lost access to their resources.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.960]   Seamless collaboration, of course, is important,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.480]   and that's one of the thing LastPass does in the enterprise.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.520]   We use it here, we'll have a folder for each part
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.480]   of the business, so there's a folder for the business
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.680]   operation, for sales, for network operations.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.040]   Those passwords are there.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.720]   If you're on that team, you have access,
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.400]   if you're not, you don't.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.000]   So it really is a great way to keep everybody online,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.440]   keeping things done.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.960]   It's great for the admins.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.840]   We have 100 plus policies we can enforce.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.440]   We enforce things like two-factor,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.160]   you gotta use two-factor.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.200]   We don't have to, but we turn it on
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.520]   because we wanna make sure every one of our employees
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.960]   is using it.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.240]   We have a pretty smart band of employees here,
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.800]   so they're happy to do that.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.200]   We also turn on minimum requirements for their master password.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.560]   That's really important.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.440]   We know on the dashboard exactly who's accessing
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.920]   what resource, no matter where they're working,
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.880]   that's important too, 'cause they may not be on site,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.800]   but we still know, oh yeah, that's Robin,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.320]   she's accessing the QuickBooks, oh yeah,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.960]   that's Lisa, she's in the sales system, that's all okay.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.200]   The good news is increased security doesn't have to be
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   complex, not with LastPass.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.400]   Start your journey today, visit LastPass.com/twit
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.880]   and find out how they can help you.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.720]   And thank you, LastPass, for supporting us.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.120]   Thank you for supporting LastPass,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.360]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.200]   - I'm turning your mics back on.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.920]   The gang is all assembled, Ed Bot is here from ZDNet,
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.480]   the Ed Bot Report.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.680]   Also, actually, Ed was saying it's almost all CBS Interactive
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.520]   and Seth, you even used to work for CNET,
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.520]   so Lexi's from ZDNet, which is now a CNET,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.040]   which is so confusing to me,
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.640]   and Seth's used to be in the CNET news,
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.440]   so I didn't plan it that way, but I'm glad you're all here.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.480]   Google taking advantage of this by donating $800 million
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.560]   to fight coronavirus, most of that in ad credits.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   - Yeah, you know, I read that headline
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.920]   and then I read the first two lines and I said,
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.240]   "Oh, come on." - And that doesn't count.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.120]   - Well, especially 'cause ad sales
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.200]   are down across the board anyway,
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.680]   it's like they got all these slots they have to fill.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.720]   It's remnant advertising, you know, Leo,
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.480]   you know what that means better than anybody.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.880]   - Please don't imply that everything we do is,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.920]   no, we did the same thing,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.640]   but we didn't put a headline in the newspaper,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.480]   we didn't release a press release,
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.960]   we gave our longstanding clients, our direct clients,
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.280]   bonus ads, because we wanna keep them happy
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.800]   and we know they're going through tight times just as we are.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.120]   So yeah, our stuff I would never call remnant,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:19.240]   but we absolutely did give them bonus advertising.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.040]   Instacart hiring 300,000 new shoppers,
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.240]   that'll break the log jam, although Instacart shoppers
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.440]   are planning to strike on Monday because they say
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.480]   their company isn't protecting them,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.000]   as many as 200,000 Instacart employees
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.240]   could walk off the job,
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.320]   they're hoping for hazard pay, Instacart says,
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.800]   well, you guys are working more, isn't it?
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.440]   You should be happy to have a job.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.400]   They're all independent contractors, on average,
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.680]   they shop fewer than 10 hours a week,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.320]   Costco, CVS, Petco, Target, Wegmans,
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.360]   they used to be, Instacart used to be,
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   Whole Foods Amazon took it over,
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.640]   took an internal, the plan strike comes as more
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.360]   and more people stay home and we're relying on Instacart,
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.560]   but in an announcement with the Gig Workers Collective,
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.240]   which is an activist group for, I guess, Gig Workers,
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.960]   Instacart employees said the company's,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.680]   quote, "Mystreatment of shoppers is them,
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.240]   "has stooped to an all time low."
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.560]   They are, again, with the quote,
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.360]   "Proffiting astronomically off of us,
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.760]   "literally risking our lives while refusing to provide us
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.280]   "with effective protection, meaningful pay
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.480]   "and meaningful benefits."
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.920]   I think, I'm not against this,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.640]   I think this is, they should be rewarded,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   they're doing a tough job and taking some big risks,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.200]   they want personal protection equipment,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.400]   they want hand sanitizers, wipes, sprays,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.000]   and so, I don't know if you've been to the grocery store
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.120]   lately, but good luck getting,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.400]   they used to have wipes for the carts,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.680]   good luck getting those, they're all good.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.920]   - How dare they want to be treated like people?
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.840]   - Like humans, what's wrong with you?
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.680]   Your gig workers.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.000]   - So there were a couple of stories I heard this week.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.400]   There was one company, a travel related company,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   and a member of the team reported Monday morning,
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.600]   there was a big Zoom meeting,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.360]   big company-wide Zoom meeting.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.640]   A hundred people signed on,
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.760]   everyone was chatting excitedly at the beginning of the thing,
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.440]   you know, geez, you know, is this gonna be
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.560]   some kind of big team building thing?
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.560]   The CEO comes on and rattles off a prepared speech
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.840]   about coronavirus and the economy,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.120]   and then says, "And everyone on this call is fired,
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.800]   laid off immediately."
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.880]   It was just ghastly, I went to the company's website
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:46.640]   and looked at their HR page,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.520]   and it was definitely a mismatch
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.160]   between the happy talk on their HR page
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.480]   and what they did there.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.920]   There was another story that I heard this week
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.440]   of people, a completely different company,
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.960]   but it was double digit number of employees
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.800]   were given a, were emailed a Zoom link
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.360]   and they clicked the link,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.880]   and that took them to a prerecorded message,
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   telling them they had been laid off.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.920]   - But Ed, you don't expect them to do the traditional,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.520]   come in the office, sorry to tell you,
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.840]   but we have to lay you off.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.680]   They don't want that face to face.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.000]   - There's probably a spot somewhere
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.440]   between those two approaches.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.040]   - That's a little Dallas, yeah.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.720]   - But the idea, I mean, these are the Zoom stories
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.680]   that are, you know,
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.280]   - We at least made personal phone calls
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.000]   to each of the people we had to lay off.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.360]   - Absolutely, you can do that.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.320]   - You do that.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.240]   You absolutely do that, you know.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.600]   - But I understand, I mean,
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.640]   a lot of companies, very few companies have reserves.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.800]   I mean, you look at the airlines,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.200]   they squandered all their cash from all the money
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.720]   they made over the last few years on stock buybacks.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.640]   I don't have a lot of sympathy for them.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.560]   But most companies like ours,
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.480]   it's not like we have a year's payroll in the bank,
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.560]   you know, so that we can keep,
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.480]   if we could, I would keep paying everybody.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.880]   What we're trying to do is save the company
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.200]   by laying a few people off,
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.160]   hoping to keep the rest employed.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.360]   I don't know, it's,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.800]   I have sympathy on both sides.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.640]   You're right, that seems very callous.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.600]   - I don't know what the right way is,
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.200]   but that ain't it.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.040]   - Yeah.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.760]   - Yeah.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.080]   - I'm not a big fan of these corporate bailouts.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.480]   I know that's a shock.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.040]   - Some, look, we need an airline industry, right?
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.560]   We need airlines.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.880]   - Sure, that's true.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.120]   - Invital to the economy.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   - Sure, but maybe it's offensive.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.920]   - I agree, but what are you gonna do?
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.200]   You need the airlines.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.040]   You can't just say, well, you blew it guys, bye bye,
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:52.880]   we need 'em.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.920]   What are you gonna do?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.360]   - I think that companies that have had many, many years
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.680]   to advocate for better worker policies,
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.080]   suddenly crying because they're about to get decimated.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.400]   - I know.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.240]   - It's unstable.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.680]   - I mean, it's worse than unseemly
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.480]   because people are literally dying.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.880]   People are going to be dying a lot more
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.760]   and it's not from something random
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.800]   and it's not from something unstoppable.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.240]   It is from something that we know exactly how to deal
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.680]   with who know exactly how to stop it.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.000]   - I wouldn't mind seeing--
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.560]   - This behavior is, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.840]   One thing that really impressed me
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.160]   for all of the screw-ups in the UK
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.880]   regarding their response to coronavirus
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.560]   and their idiotic interpretation of herd immunity
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:45.640]   and that is a technical definition of idiotic.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.040]   They came back and they said, we're gonna pay everybody
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.560]   who gets laid off 80% of their wages
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.960]   because they know that if you can't support people
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.840]   who are living in your country,
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.600]   then you're not gonna be able to prevent this virus
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.000]   from spreading because they're gonna be on the street,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.600]   there's gonna be significant societal problems.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.920]   And here in the US, we have this attitude of
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.520]   and you can just run the sensor beep right now
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.040]   because there's a lot of profanity I have to say about this.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.480]   People are gonna be dying.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.800]   People are not gonna have money in their accounts.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.160]   $1200 per person, are you kidding me?
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   Like in San Francisco that'll get you food,
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.680]   that won't get you rent.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.720]   And if you have a family, you get $2400.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.640]   I mean, this is nuts.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.680]   This is all nuts.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.480]   This is terrifying.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   And for friends of mine who are entertainers,
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.560]   who are musicians or artists,
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.320]   this is a death now.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.760]   - Socialism is starting to look a little bit better, isn't it?
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.800]   Take over, bail out the airlines, but take them over.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.960]   - Something.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.920]   - That's what they do in most countries, right?
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.600]   - I don't know.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.720]   - I mean, eat the riches not out of the realm
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   of possibility right now.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.560]   - Geez.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.760]   Well, can you start at my thigh, please?
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.640]   - Sure, we'll cut a little chuck off at a time.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.560]   - Yay, yay, yay.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.040]   Detroit Auto Show canceled.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.360]   FEMA is actually taking over the Detroit Hall
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.960]   to prepare a field hospital for COVID.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.640]   Here was the weirdest story,
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.600]   and Samable's "Submit Our Car Guide" told me about this.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.120]   Of course, most, I think all the motor races,
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.240]   NASCAR, Formula One, they've all been canceled.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.680]   Now they're doing them virtually as e-sports.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.240]   If you turn in Fox Sports One right now.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   - What?
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.520]   - No, I know.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.320]   If you turn in Fox Sports One right now,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.680]   you'll see a game, a video game.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.520]   That's the race.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.160]   The actual drivers are driving the cars.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.840]   (laughs)
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.760]   I know, it's--
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.840]   - I'm fine.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.040]   - That's an onion headline.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:50.880]   - No!
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.960]   - Where, you know, everything's an onion headline in 2020.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.800]   So it's--
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.720]   - It's, yeah, tell me about it.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.560]   - It's hard to tell.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.640]   I feel bad for the onion,
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.920]   'cause I don't know if you could tell what's,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.040]   what's real and what's not.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.280]   Let me see if I can find this.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.960]   The, there was a big NASCAR race.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.560]   Oh, shoot, I wish I'd save this.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.760]   Oh, yeah, it's,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.320]   now it's horse racing.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.360]   And actually horse racing is continuing for real,
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.480]   but there's nobody in the stands.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.320]   - I got a PR pitch today from someone very excitedly
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.040]   telling me about their new Zoom-based
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.880]   live online poker games.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:41.120]   So they built on top of Zoom, I guess another layer.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.800]   And they swear, it's all for fun.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.000]   It's not tied to an online casino of any kind.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.160]   But I know, that's,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.480]   you know, that one I'm all actually in favor of.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.360]   That's a really good, good, I mean,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.280]   words with friends and all these social games should,
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.640]   you know, that would be a good thing to be doing
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.480]   right about now.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.800]   But having the Formula One drivers doing,
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.360]   you know, their PlayStation version.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.440]   - It's a little weird, I think it's a little weird.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.640]   The company that does the simulation is called iRacing
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.040]   at iRacing.com.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.320]   And they're the same cars, they're the same drivers,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.960]   but they're virtual.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.800]   They have mechanical breakdowns and all kinds of things.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.920]   This is how they're doing auto races now,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.600]   which is odd to some of these.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.160]   Aren't they doing e-sports MMA next?
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160]   - That's, I think a good idea.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.360]   I think I heard that too.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.480]   - Are they really?
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.160]   They're really doing-- - Oh God, I was making that up.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.120]   - Again, we live in the onion world.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.360]   - Yeah, all right, done.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.080]   - Welcome to the onion.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:57.920]   Is it real?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.760]   I don't know.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.840]   - I don't know what the Konami code would be
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.200]   for one of the--
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.440]   (laughing)
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.280]   - Why?
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.000]   - I'm racing like a real drive.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.120]   - It's wild.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.640]   We live in very interesting times.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.560]   Vidcom canceled, of course.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.120]   I mean, all the conferences are gonna be canceled.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.360]   - Speaking of conferences, can we back up?
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.320]   Why did the Detroit Auto Show just make this announcement
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.720]   that they were canceling?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.600]   What did they think was gonna happen?
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.840]   - Yeah, you have to wonder.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.320]   I mean, I think there were a lot of people
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.600]   still living in hope, right?
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.800]   Like, oh, it'll be better next week.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.120]   - It's the Elizabeth Kubler-Ross sequence.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.960]   - Denial.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.360]   - But for conferences.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.200]   - Yeah, right.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   - Yeah, it's denial, anger, bargaining.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.840]   You ultimately get to acceptance.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.360]   - To the acceptance, yeah.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.860]   - I think I've left out,
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:59.360]   there's a spreadsheet in the middle somewhere
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   where you're looking at the money
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.000]   that you have to be refunding to your attendees.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.320]   - Is it gonna get worse?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.480]   Is it gonna get worse before it gets better?
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.440]   Or is the light, can we see the light
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.200]   at the end of the tunnel?
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.560]   - It's gonna get worse.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.800]   - It's gonna get a lot worse.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.440]   One of the things I didn't mention about
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.040]   J.G.O. Srui and Kensek West was that
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.160]   he actually discovered the hard way that,
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.680]   'cause he had to, that the Zoom conferencing
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.600]   for the cybersecurity training sessions
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.520]   that he runs before the conference,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.160]   sort of like these pre-conference,
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.840]   cyber dojo things.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.360]   He was actually very pleased with the turnout.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   And in fact, one class had the devices
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.280]   that the students were hacking
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.160]   had already been shipped to Vancouver from Israel.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.120]   The instructor couldn't leave Israel
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.520]   to come to Vancouver, so he was stuck there.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.320]   And then the students were molded into these devices
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.640]   from all over the world.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   And you know, Andrejos told me that he was
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.000]   very pleased with the turnout.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.640]   The class had a dozen students in it.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.360]   And he realized that there might be an opportunity for him
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.280]   to continue to run cybersecurity education
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.960]   throughout the year.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.880]   The benefit being that people who are very eager
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.320]   to learn these skills, but can't afford to travel
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.120]   to where the classes are physically,
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.280]   can, you know, can remote in and can do things.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.480]   It doesn't quite have one to one,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.080]   it's not quite a one to one system.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.040]   You don't have the teacher looking over your shoulder,
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.560]   you know, to help you out when you make a mistake.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.600]   But he said that he thinks that he's far more optimistic
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.880]   about his ability and the ability of other small
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.600]   conference organizers to do what they need to do
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.400]   in order to survive digitally.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.080]   The big ones I have no idea about,
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.640]   I don't know how you replicate the insanity
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.160]   of walking down, you know, the Las Vegas Convention Center
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.080]   or whatever.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.480]   Tell us about the PONDON.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   So the teams, which, and this is a wonderful yearly event,
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.240]   hackers save exploits all year long,
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.480]   hoping to win big bucks.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.440]   Used to be they'd get the machine they hacked.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.640]   I don't know if they still do that.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   That's still the case.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.880]   They get the machine.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.800]   Last year at PONDON, two hackers won a Tesla
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.640]   because they hacked through the infotainment system.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.440]   So hence the name, PONDOT and ONET.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.320]   But this year, of course, they didn't do it in person.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.080]   So what, they email the exploits, how did they do that?
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.160]   - I think, I think what they did was,
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.680]   so a little bit more background on PONDOTON,
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.720]   it's quite challenging because as the hackers
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.840]   are developing the exploits and creating the exploit chains
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.360]   that are you needed, you now need a lot more
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.480]   than just one exploit to--
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.760]   - A lot of the exploits were like six different exploits,
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.520]   one after the other, to get deeper and deeper
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.680]   into the system.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.520]   Ultimately, you win by, what, PONDING the system by?
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.240]   - Right, what is that defined?
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.080]   - By getting shell or getting root on the device.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.080]   And usually what happens is it's sort of this ongoing race
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.360]   between the hackers and the device makers
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.040]   to patch their systems.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.120]   And in fact, there've been multiple cases where,
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.320]   you know, an organization that makes, say,
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.560]   you know, Google Chrome or another device
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.520]   will send out a patch the day before PONDOTON.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.720]   And it's not unheard of, it's actually quite common
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   for those patches to kill an exploit in that chain.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.800]   And so there's sort of this race between the hackers
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   and the companies to see who can get it first.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.280]   But it's, this year I believe that they emailed them
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   into the organization ZDI, which runs PONDOTON.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.160]   - So the team Floro-Alacetate, which is one I think
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.360]   three or four years in a row now.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.120]   - Yeah, they're the ones who hacked the Tesla last year.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:29.960]   - Yeah.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.800]   - Two guys.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.640]   - Yeah.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   - How did they split custody on the Tesla?
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.560]   - Yeah, they probably sold it.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.520]   - Well, I think they, one lives in North America
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.000]   and one doesn't and so, or at least didn't used to.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.400]   So I think it was whenever he flew over,
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400]   he got to drive it.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.320]   (laughs)
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.840]   Something like that.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.960]   - I hope he sanitizes before he goes
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.880]   for a ride.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.080]   So everything, I don't think anything survived, right?
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.400]   Did anything survive?
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.480]   - I don't think so.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.440]   - Everything was hacked.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.440]   Safari.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.560]   There, wait a minute, no, I think there was,
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.880]   was it VMware that survived one of the virtual machines
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.720]   survived.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.600]   Of course, a virtual machine take down is awesome.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.320]   If you can escape the virtual machine,
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.240]   now you're really golden, right?
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.000]   - Right, right.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   - You know, in retrospect, or maybe one of the
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.560]   Ponto owns coming up, maybe we'll start seeing a lot more
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   remote video conferencing hacks using that to get into systems.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.720]   - And not just Zoom bombing.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.680]   - So, Ahmaud, comma, yeah, Zoom bombing.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.520]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.000]   And Richard Jew are a floral acetate.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.760]   They came in first with nine points.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.840]   Jew actually has his own four points
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.360]   'cause he did his own hack later.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.080]   It was pretty exciting, I think.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.720]   We used to do a play-by-play.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.040]   I think maybe we need to bring that back.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.080]   The Pondo owned play-by-play.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.160]   - Well, there's that British sports pass.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.320]   - Isn't he great?
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.520]   - Who's been doing the play-by-play on his dog's eating.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.680]   So maybe he can do that.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.000]   - That's a great Twitter feed.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.200]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.560]   He does play-by-play for even like just people waiting
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.200]   in a bus stop.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.040]   - Right.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.880]   - Let me see if I can find some of these
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.800]   and play them back for you here.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.080]   I'm running on the board.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.720]   Here's the one he did.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.200]   This is his name is Andrew Cotter.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.640]   He's on Twitter @andrew.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.960]   I think it's @andrewcotter on Twitter.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.280]   Mr. Andrew Cotter on Twitter.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.800]   And some of them are very,
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.840]   let's see if I can play one here for you.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.200]   No, that's not it.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   That's got music.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920]   That's not it.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:58.720]   In her familiar black five times the champion.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.240]   - So he's at what a rugby company?
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.920]   - I'm not fitting that it should come down to these two.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.560]   Olive in her familiar black five times the champion,
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.960]   Mabel the rising star.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.360]   - (laughs)
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.120]   - Yeah, excited they are.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.920]   But also field attention.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.200]   And here it's in the crowd as we near the start final.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.040]   And now they go, olive away first,
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.560]   but a problem with Mabel's ball.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.480]   That might cost her now having to play catch up.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.960]   Both settling quickly into rhythm.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.520]   You can see the constant style.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.360]   - This is a guy.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.200]   - Really bored although.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.040]   - Mabel can be tail use.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.880]   Happy to be alive.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.720]   Everything's amazing.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.440]   Olive more steady, wasting little energy.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.040]   Very much of the old Labrador school
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.720]   eating the serious business.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.920]   Don't bollocks around wagging your tail.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.600]   Mabel seems just a little sluggish here.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.440]   - So it's two dogs.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.640]   - Mabel was taken out of her by the warm medicine.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   She was given last night when we thought.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.000]   - Eating but olive food.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.080]   - Focused relentless.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.280]   Tasting absolutely nothing.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.880]   Mabel trying, but surely a loss cause.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.080]   Her title defence coming to an end.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.720]   Olive taking everything.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.120]   Nothing left but the bull to lick now.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.680]   And Mabel, well doesn't seem too upset.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.520]   A bit of class there from the youngster,
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.480]   generous in what will surely be defeat
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.400]   because Olive has won now.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.720]   She's taken the title back at seven and a half.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.120]   Mabel looking to offer congratulations again
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.680]   to the dog who was her inspiration growing up.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.560]   - Once more wonderful to see that spirit in the game.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.720]   And finally we've had here great rivals, but great friends.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.200]   And you see the swapping of bulls at the end.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.680]   Join us again tomorrow live coverage of a snooze
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.960]   on the sofa.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.800]   - Absolutely.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.560]   (laughing)
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.720]   - You're all wonderful.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.720]   He's found his michay I think.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.640]   Forget the soccer.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.120]   Our show today brought to you by CashFlime.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.760]   When I say brought to you by CashFlime,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.320]   I mean quite literally brought to you by CashFlime.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.600]   When you download our shows,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   it comes from our content delivery network at CashFlime.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.520]   And I have to say for 10 years we've been doing that,
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.880]   we deliver petabytes of audio and video
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.760]   every single month to our audience.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.960]   And not once have we had a problem.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.800]   Not once.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.040]   And the nice thing is the CashFlime bill is smoothed out.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.120]   They look at all your peaks and spikes
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.000]   and our data delivery is quite spiky.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.080]   And they smooth it out over a year long thing.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.960]   So you don't ever get surprised.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.360]   You don't spend time logging in
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.600]   if I exceeded my bandwidth cap this month.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.200]   I don't have to ever worry about that.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.560]   Now CashFlime is introducing a new technology
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.800]   that I love.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.240]   It's 100% cash shield.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.480]   That's what they call.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.800]   With this new feature,
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.720]   you'll benefit from a drastic reduction
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.720]   in data transfer fees
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.840]   with AWS's S3 and other cloud storage origins
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.680]   by increasing your cash hit ratio to 100%.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.880]   You pay for storage at CashFlime.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.800]   It supplies the cash to all the various CashFlime servers.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.840]   So if you ever get a out of date cash,
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.800]   you don't have to worry about suddenly
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   a lot of data transferred out of S3.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.040]   Customers are looking for high quality content,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.200]   big files, 4K delivered anytime on any device
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.640]   anywhere in the world.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.200]   Whether it's your webpage loading,
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.280]   your video buffering, your games downloading,
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.600]   you need to be faster.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.200]   And as a podcast network,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.800]   man, there's nothing better than CashFlime.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.440]   And you just can't do that
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.160]   when your cash items are being evicted
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.640]   for large one-off requests
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.560]   that cost you a fortune in data transfer out fees.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.600]   That's what 100% cash shield was invented for.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.320]   With 100% cash shield and CashFlime's guaranteed availability,
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.560]   there's a simple way to avoid it.

[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.760]   For today and tomorrow,
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.440]   a dedicated storage space just for you.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.000]   You keep your content and your data closer to your customers
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.960]   without the traffic of other companies.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.120]   You buy as much space as you need.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.040]   Your data will always be fetched
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.880]   from 100% cash shield, not your origin.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.160]   Shielding reduces origin spend by thousands a month
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.560]   because, and there are never any cash misses,
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.080]   100% cash shield, get it?

[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.320]   When you download our podcast,
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.360]   I don't know if you've noticed this,
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.000]   whether it's in your podcast client or from our website,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.320]   boom, it comes in fast, no waiting.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.160]   That's beautiful.

[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.880]   for a global audience of any size nowadays.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.000]   That's important too, right?
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.840]   We're doing a lot more of that.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.520]   Get hyper fast download speeds,

[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.760]   or your big conferences.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.960]   CashFlime, their global throughput performance dominance
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.320]   ensures that any cash misses
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.160]   are delivered five times faster than from your origins.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.320]   People won't even know.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.360]   It was a cash miss, didn't know.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.240]   Just for you right now,
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.160]   CashFlime is giving away a complimentary, no pressure,

[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.880]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.560]   You send them your bill, they'll tell you,
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.880]   hey, you're overpaying.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.600]   In many cases, as much as 20% or more for your CDN,
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.080]   get the best, use what we use,
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.440]   twit.cashfly.com.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.360]   We thank them so much for their support,
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.000]   twit.cashfly.com.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.840]   When you download our shows,
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.880]   you're literally using CashFlime every single time.

[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.400]   Hackers are, of course,
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.080]   jumping on the opportunity to take advantage of any disaster.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.840]   According to the FBI, hackers are sending, get this.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.160]   This is really low, malicious teddy bears
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.160]   via the postal service, along with USB drives,
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.640]   the FBI warns organizations and security professionals
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.920]   that cyber criminal groups have been targeting
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.760]   various businesses with malicious USB devices,
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.480]   acting as a keyboard when plugged into a computer,
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.880]   injecting commands, downloading and executing
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.560]   a JavaScript backdoor.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:56.200]   Here's one pretending to be a best buy refund.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.600]   Oh, Lord.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.280]   - 2007 wants its security headlines back.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.120]   - Yeah.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.400]   - This is really sort of oldish.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.760]   - When they call these candy drops,
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.200]   the leaving behind the USB key.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.760]   The sad thing is these USB, like bad USB, was never fixed.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.120]   So you could still hack these things very easily
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.200]   and put them, you know, send them out via email.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:25.760]   Hackers never, never rests, do they?
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   Let's see.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.200]   Snopes has had to scale back its facts checking
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.040]   because there's so much COVID-19 misinformation.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.360]   They can't keep up.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.520]   They can't keep up.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.880]   Exhausting our staff in this crisis is not the cure
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.600]   for what is ailing our industry, says Snopes.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.240]   We're overwhelming.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.520]   Our small team is being overwhelmed
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.280]   and we can't ask them to ramp up productivity.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.280]   - Well, and you're also starting to see now some reports.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:03.240]   I haven't seen them confirmed by multiple sources yet,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.040]   but some reports that the Chinese are using the same types
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.080]   of networks that the Russians used for disinformation.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:18.120]   And, you know, so coronavirus disinformation schemes
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.600]   coming from China now.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.440]   - Yeah.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.280]   - And Russia.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.960]   - And Russia. - And China and Russia.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520]   - It's pretty gross.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.080]   There is that story from Reuters,
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.040]   Joe Mann wrote up on the cyber,
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.480]   oh God, what are they called?
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:45.680]   The CTI League, the Cyber Threat Intelligence League,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.680]   which is fighting COVID-19 misinformation, disinformation.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.000]   - Are they like the Justice League?
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.920]   Is that who these guys are?
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.400]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a large group of professional hackers,
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.080]   cybersecurity experts.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:07.120]   Mark Rogers, who is a VP at Okta,
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.880]   and he's well known in the cyber security
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.520]   and infosec communities,
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.120]   is one of the four people who's organizing this.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.200]   But they said that they're seeing phishing attacks
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.760]   in every language known to man.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.760]   I don't know how you send a phishing attack in cuneiform,
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.720]   but I presume all the other ones
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.920]   are being represented.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.480]   And people are so freaked out by the coronavirus and COVID-19
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.240]   that they're clicking on things
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.440]   that they really ought not to be clicking on.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.360]   - So this is the story.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.320]   They're the CTI League,
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   there's 400 security experts of 40 countries.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.160]   And what are they doing?
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.040]   Is it an informational thing?
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.400]   Are they like the Justice League,
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.760]   donning tights in a cape and running over
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.880]   and fixing your computer?
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.160]   What are they doing?
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.480]   - What are they doing?
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.160]   - I don't know that I-- - I have the help!
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.960]   - I don't know that I want to see people in tights
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.200]   any more than I have to.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.600]   - Security experts. - Security experts.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.720]   - Especially from the security community
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.560]   because God loved them.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.720]   They are-- - Not the fittest bunch.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.560]   - Yes.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.400]   - Oh.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:27.040]   I think what's happening is that they're sharing information
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.480]   on the phishing attacks that they're seeing
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.680]   in ways that they haven't shared it before.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:38.200]   And it's, these messages are being used to get people
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.680]   to cough up passwords, other sensitive information,
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.320]   which almost always comes back to finances, right?
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.280]   And if you can own some companies corporate network
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   because they get inside the VPN, why not?
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.000]   - So, you know, Rogers didn't give Joe Men a lot of specifics,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.920]   but he did say that they had already dismantled one campaign
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.920]   that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.600]   It's not really clear how much they're stopping.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.400]   Certainly I can say that I've personally seen an uptick
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.360]   in coronavirus spam and not just pitches
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.240]   from, you know, desperate marketers.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.320]   - You know, standard rules apply.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.000]   Don't click on stuff if you get text messages.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.880]   Make sure you know who it's from.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.160]   - Well, I think people working from home,
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.760]   you don't have the IT department down the hall.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.400]   You might feel a little bit more comfy
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.360]   'cause you're wearing your bunny slippers
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.920]   and your guard might be down a little bit.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.600]   And of course, the thing I most worry about
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.120]   is when those people working from home come back to work
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.320]   and put that computer on the network,
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.600]   I guess if they're VPN-ing,
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.040]   they might as well be on the network.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.760]   And that's just gonna be bad.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.920]   I wanna take a little break.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.520]   There is more opportunism coming.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.080]   This time from China and Huawei
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.220]   who are proposing a redesign for the internet.
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.360]   They call it new IP.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.880]   And we'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.080]   Lexi Savidus is here.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.680]   Hi Lexi.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.520]   - Hi. - Good to have you.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.880]   What are you still doing videos?
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.080]   Is there stuff to talk about?
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.360]   - Yeah, I mean, there's always stuff to talk about.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.840]   I mean, so I'm kind of interested in using existing things
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.600]   that I have and making the most of it
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.480]   because getting new product is challenging.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.320]   - Yeah.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.720]   - We're all doing like work from home videos
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.560]   and stuff like that, right?
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.400]   - Exactly.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.280]   So it's about, I'm trying to focus on things
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.200]   that you can do with existing tech that you already have.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.640]   Maybe even repurposing really old stuff.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.280]   - I'm starting to do cooking videos.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.520]   (laughing)
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.280]   - Is it me?
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.200]   Because I must have at some point searched for sourdough
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   'cause it seems like everybody in the world
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.520]   is now cooking sourdough bread as they're stuck at home.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.880]   Yeah, it's not just me.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.440]   - We get two big jars of sourdough starter out there.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   - Everybody's doing it.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.280]   - Counter.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.120]   - Right, yeah.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.600]   - So I wanna make a video because all this time,
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.520]   okay, this is really off topic,
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.840]   all this time, you know, when you make sourdough starter,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840]   you feed it every day, sometimes twice a day
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.200]   if you really want an active starter,
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.280]   which means it grows, it's bigger.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.960]   So all this time I've been throwing out the excess starter.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.280]   I've been doing it for years.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.880]   It's pouring it in the garbage.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.160]   Then I saw a video, says, "No, throw it out.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.600]   "Cook a delicious sourdough pancake."
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.920]   So I take out the pan, I put a little butter in it,
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.640]   pour the excess sourdough in the pan,
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.920]   it makes a big nice, put little scallions on it,
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.240]   or I have some Trader Joe's Everything Bigel.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.520]   Spice put that on there.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.040]   - A little savory pancake.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.040]   - It's delicious.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.440]   I have it for lunch every day.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.200]   I have a little sourdough pancake, just a little tip.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.520]   (laughs)
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.120]   - I'm trying to do a new recipe every day.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.680]   So every day on Instagram,
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.920]   I'm just doing a couple of stories every day
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.040]   about a new recipe.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.360]   So-- - I gotta get back on Instagram.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.480]   Follow you, what's your Instagram handle?
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.320]   - It's just my, it's same as my Twitter handle.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.560]   I don't like CCB.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:05.200]   - L-E-X-Y-S-A-W-V-I-D-E-S.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.440]   - That's correct.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.840]   - And a recipe or two every day on Instagram.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.800]   - Yesterday was for Kacha and pizza,
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.640]   and tonight, I don't know what it's gonna be.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.440]   It's, this is kind of, I'm calling it quarantine kitchen,
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.360]   because it's like a dwindling--
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.920]   - Whatever I got.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.920]   - Bridge and pantry.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.640]   And so the recipes were quite elaborate at the start
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   of quarantine two weeks ago.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.560]   And now we're getting more and more basic
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.520]   with whatever I have left, so.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.120]   - Chickpeas stew.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.520]   That's what I'm down to.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.640]   Chickpeas stew.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.400]   - Nice, nice.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.000]   - What I've actually taken to do is I'm sorting now
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.120]   all the beans and rice and dry stuff,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.040]   legumes by expiration date, so that I can do the,
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.680]   I have some for back to 2017,
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.800]   but I think that they don't go bad, they're just dry.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.760]   - White rice will keep basically and definitely--
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.000]   - Brown rice, brown rice, not so much.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:58.840]   - Really?
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.680]   - Brown rice, you have to be careful.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.040]   - I love the, I'm doing a lot of the brown rice.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.520]   All right, well, I'll use the brown rice first.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.360]   Thank you for that, Tippid.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.600]   - It's the point we live to serve.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.960]   - The quarantine, yeah.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.720]   - I'm a little shocked, I've never had any rice
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.440]   stick around long enough in the house.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.880]   I go through, I don't wanna even tell you.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   - Long rice, this is one of the nice--
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   - I do tons of cooking, so I don't keep stuff.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.960]   - You know what, after the break, we're gonna come back,
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.240]   we're gonna do the recipe of the week.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.040]   Forget all this tech news, I'm so bored.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.120]   - You wanna go.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.680]   - I could talk about kitchen tech,
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.680]   I'm still trying to figure out what a mango peeler
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.760]   is supposed to do.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.040]   - I am a sucker for kitchen tech,
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.160]   and my wife says I can't buy anymore
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.160]   'cause I filled the counter,
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.360]   and there's no more room on the counter,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.520]   and she's moving old stuff out,
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.440]   but I got this thing that was all the rage
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.140]   a few years ago in Europe called the Thermo Mix.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:02.160]   It is crazy, it is a crazy device, it does everything,
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.760]   and I've been playing with that,
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.160]   so I'm gonna get good at Thermo Mixology.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.840]   Maybe I'll do some Thermo Mix videos.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.520]   - I'm big into the Vitamix.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:14.040]   - Vitamix, so Thermo Mix is the next thing after the Vitamix.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:14.880]   - Is it?
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.960]   - Yeah.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.800]   - It's like a--
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.080]   - I gotta say though, the single most important thing
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.680]   I have in the kitchen, aside from cast iron pans,
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.680]   is my $10 rice cooker that I got off of Craigslist in 2007,
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.920]   and it's a 10 cup, and I just--
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.480]   - That's another project I put on.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.600]   - I put all my cast iron pans in the oven,
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.880]   did a cleaning cycle, they're all down to the bare metal,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.440]   now I gotta get the flax oil,
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.040]   that's gonna take me a few weeks.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.800]   I gotta redo all my cast iron pans.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.440]   - Oh, it's so sad.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.280]   - I showed it.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.600]   Thank you Lexi for being--
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.440]   - You're supposed to use them.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   - Yeah, no, I know, but every once in a while,
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.280]   I like to burn them down.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.880]   You know, if you put them in the oven
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.560]   and do the cleaning cycle, it gets everything off,
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.520]   you start over, and then you can build up using flax oil,
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.800]   you can build up some really nice reconditioning.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.560]   So I like to every once in a while I do that.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.680]   Just, I don't know, I got nothing else to do.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.680]   - It's ambitious.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.400]   - It is, it's over ambitious, but I got, like I said,
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.240]   nothing else to do.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.080]   Also Ed Bot is here from the Ed Bot Report,
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.040]   and it's wonderful to have you,
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.880]   and of course Seth Rosenblatt from the-parallax.org.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.640]   That's the security you say you started what,
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.960]   a year ago, two years ago?
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.800]   - Five years ago.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.040]   - That long.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.720]   - Four and a half, something.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.440]   - Nice job, yeah.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.000]   - Yeah, yeah, I'd like to make money on it,
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.760]   but you know, I don't have to eat, I have rice.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.040]   - Well, at least you're not down to ramen.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.600]   - Yeah, we can have conversations about ramen.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.080]   - It's, the website is the, let me pull it up,
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.280]   'cause I have it on the lower third.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.560]   The-parallax.com, I'm sorry, I said the org.com.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.240]   - I also have.org, it'll take 'em to this thing.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.080]   - That's what I thought, okay, good.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.320]   Thank you, Seth.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.120]   We, we, we, the editors are all home, all working hard,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:20.280]   but they made a little, a little promo for all of you.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.800]   - If you missed anything this week,
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.080]   this is what you might've missed this week on Twitch.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.880]   - Previously on Twitch.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.160]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.600]   - We speculated G will Apple release new hardware,
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.960]   their stores are closed.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.000]   - Well, they announced a new MacBook Air
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.920]   and a new iPad troll.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.160]   - And what was that the MacBook Air you got there, is it?
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.000]   - Oh, gold.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:40.840]   - Oh.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.920]   - Hands on tech.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.480]   We're working from home, many of us,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.840]   and so I have some stuff here and some recommendations
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.160]   for you so that you can have the best work
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.240]   from home experience that you can.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   - Tech news weekly.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.880]   - Zoom quickly in a very short amount of time
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.960]   has become the go-to tool for people
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.520]   suddenly finding themselves, you know,
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.120]   working from home, kind of like we're doing right here,
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.240]   but there may be some reason to be
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.440]   at least hesitant or concerned.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.720]   - Problem with Zoom is much of its structure centers on
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.680]   giving explicit knowledge to the hosts
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.080]   and the attendees don't really get to know
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.240]   they learn later on.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.920]   The ability of administrators to dial into a call
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.320]   whenever they want of that organization.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.840]   They have the autonomy to do that.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.640]   And so right now this is a Mac or Break moment
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.760]   for all of us where we can put pressure on Zoom and say,
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.560]   "You need to be explicitly clear about what's being extracted,
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.360]   what's being accessed."
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.720]   - Hello everybody, welcome to Hands on Mac and Tush.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.760]   Once again, we're gonna show you
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.400]   how to get the most out of your Mac.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.000]   I got a Lulu of a program, literally.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.680]   I have Lulu running in the background
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.920]   on all my Macs at all times,
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.160]   letting me know when something outbound
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.440]   is trying to connect.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.040]   It's keeping the bad guys from going to the outside world,
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.600]   sending your data out, connecting to a command
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.920]   and control server, doing anything to it.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:03.000]   Learn something new every day and what it means.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.960]   - The New York Times had article in the text section saying
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.680]   that it was bad etiquette for your kids
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.200]   and pets to show up on your conference call.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.120]   - Bull (beep)
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.200]   - So your dog should be on your lap.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.920]   - Oh, that is a sweet puppy.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.880]   - Oh, that dog here in my lipstick gross.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.120]   (laughing)
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.400]   - Okay, that might be TMI.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.240]   (laughing)
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.680]   - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.000]   - Sorry.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.680]   - Oh, we had fun, I have to say.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.480]   And if any of you have pets you wanna bring in, please.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.040]   Don't hesitate, any pets?
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.160]   Where's, oh, oh, oh, what is that?
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.880]   - That is zero the dog.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.720]   - Oh, is she?
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.320]   - She says zero the dog.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.840]   - She's a professional.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.920]   I can't tell you what the full name for zero is,
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.120]   but the second two words, second and third word is F and G.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.120]   I figured that out.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.680]   (laughing)
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.880]   - See, I think that's good on your conference calls.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.160]   I like it.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.120]   - Oh, no, she's great, but she doesn't care.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.840]   She doesn't wanna be on the conference call.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   She wants to know when we're going out running.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.320]   - Yeah.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.480]   - We share Lucy files a day.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.200]   - Yeah, we've got Lucy the Springer Spaniel
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.760]   who I just saw the car pull in.
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.920]   She just got back from the dog park.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.760]   - Oh, we might be seeing her.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.120]   - We have a, so she's gonna go in
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.920]   and head straight for the food bowl.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.800]   And then, you know, and then at that point,
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.040]   basically everything for the afternoon's list is checked off.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.320]   - Snap time.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.560]   - So, yeah.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.440]   - Apparently, Lexi, you got anybody to show us?
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.000]   Any furry critter there?
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.280]   Just your plants.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.400]   - If I ever plant babies, that's it.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.720]   I mean, I have a dog pillow.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.760]   That doesn't really count.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.680]   I mean, I wish I had a pet.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.080]   This is really the time in my life
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.040]   that I wish I petition the landlord to be like,
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.600]   "No, please let me have a dog."
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.760]   - I'm not bad.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   - I need to talk.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.040]   - So, you know, a lot of the dogs,
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:02.440]   and I'm sure even cat shelters in SF need people to come by
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.680]   and interact with the animals.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.160]   Certainly the dogs need walking.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.600]   So, if you don't mind going out and wearing a face mask,
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.280]   dog volunteer dog walks,
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.520]   there's certainly something you can do.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.880]   - A lot of dogs getting walked five, six, seven times a day now.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.840]   They're going, "Please, please."
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.760]   - I wish that was true, but that's not what I'm hearing.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.440]   - Actually, there is, in New York City, apparently,
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.760]   a shortage at the pet adoption centers,
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.520]   because everybody's rushed in and said, "Give me a pet.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.680]   Give me a pet."
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.320]   So, I actually--
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.560]   - There are still cats.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.120]   - There are still probably cats.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   Nobody looks at cats.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.760]   - Yeah, the dogs are gone.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.120]   The cats are going like, "Yeah, you can come rescue me.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:48.520]   I'll go hide in the top shop of your closet for a week.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.000]   You won't even know I'm there."
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.120]   (laughs)
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.160]   - So, what are my friends?
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.000]   - They're cats.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.840]   - What are my friends?
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.320]   - One of my friends has harness trained his cat.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.680]   - Oh, look.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.800]   - Yeah, and you can see them on Instagram and they go out
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.920]   and you put him in little outfits
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.120]   and he's a tuxedo cat named Le Pew.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.560]   And it's quite remarkable.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:15.400]   So, I keep expecting to see more harness trained cats
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.920]   in the near future, but that hasn't happened yet.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.400]   - Training cats is an exercise in futility, if you ask me.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.680]   - So, my co-author, we're working on a new edition
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.960]   of the Windows 10 Inside Outbook.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.240]   - Oh, good.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.240]   - And his wife is a professional dog walker
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.960]   and she puts the cat on a leash
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:44.440]   and walks the cat along with the dogs.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.320]   Out there in California, Southern California.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.160]   It's very...
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.040]   Modern.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.880]   - It's a little weird, according to the New York Post,
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.400]   consider the source.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.720]   South Africa is banning walking dogs.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.720]   Meanwhile in Spain, they're cracking down on pet rentals
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.800]   saying it's illegal to walk someone else's dog.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:15.160]   I don't know why they're trying to keep South Africans
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.000]   from walking their dogs.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.160]   That's one of the big things around here in Northern California.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.320]   If you go out on a walk or go to a park,
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.320]   all you see is dog lovers walking their dog.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.920]   I don't know how they could ban it in South Africa.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.520]   It's a strange, every country is reacting
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.240]   to this somewhat differently.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.520]   If you are hiring, and I hope you are,
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.440]   there are a lot of people looking for work right now
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.320]   and I wanna mention our sponsor, Zipper Cruder,
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.280]   which is the absolute best way, the easiest way to hire.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.320]   If you've got job openings, man, you're golden,
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.680]   but you wanna get the right person,
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.760]   'cause every single person you hire
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.000]   can make or break your company,
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.360]   and that's why we use Zipper Cruder.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.240]   We've done a lot of our hiring through Zipper Cruder,
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.240]   and we've been very happy with it.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.960]   According to their own research, nearly 75% of employers
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.920]   are having a hard time filling open positions,
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.080]   68% raising their wages,
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.280]   23% raising their benefits.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.280]   There are still jobs out there.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.960]   So if you're a job hunter, go to zippercruder.com,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.640]   and if you are looking to fill a position,

[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.880]   they have many, many resumes already on file,
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.600]   and one of the things they do, which is really cool,
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.920]   they use their matching technology
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.640]   to look at those resumes, look at your job,
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.120]   and then invite people who have the right qualifications
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.360]   to apply, that's why four out of five employers
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.240]   who post on Zipper Cruder will get a quality candidate
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.720]   within the first day, I bet that number's even higher.

[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.480]   within a few hours of posting on Zipper Cruder.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:50.320]   I always love Lisa's face 'cause she's always worried
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.240]   when we're down somebody, oh, this person's great,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.440]   this person's great.

[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.400]   for supporting this week in tech.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:23.440]   Let's see, GM is offering free unlimited internet access
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.560]   on its connected cars, if you have those,
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.920]   what do they call it, the on-star thing,
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.520]   is that on GM cars, you press that button?
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.120]   Yeah, you get unlimited internet access,
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.320]   who would have thunk it?
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.120]   Maybe you could use it to take free courses
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.000]   from Yale University, unhappiness and positivity.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   Practice happiness.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.200]   What does Yale know about that?
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.240]   I, you know,
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.640]   a good question.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.160]   Professor Laurie Santos, she created a course
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.760]   called the Science of Wellbeing,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.120]   was actually very popular when it was launched,
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.240]   probably because Yale students saw it as a gut, easy, hey,
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.240]   but maybe they really wanted to be happy,
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.960]   they've now released it for free,
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.000]   you're not going for a grade, so.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   This is what Yale says,
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.160]   "Professor Santos reveals misconceptions
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.880]   about happiness, annoying features of the mind
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.640]   that lead us to think the way we do
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.960]   and the research that can help us change."
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.840]   You can also take courses in artificial intelligence.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.240]   This is a good time to take Harvard's introduction
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.560]   to the Computer Science CS50 at eds.org.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.840]   There's, this is a good, take a class.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.560]   You got a little free time?
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.800]   Take a class.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.160]   I don't have any free time, legend.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.480]   You're exactly the same as always, right?
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.440]   You're doing nothing that's changed for you.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440]   It's exactly the same.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.440]   You're right, actually, I don't have any free time either.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.440]   Yeah, no, it's,
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.040]   the amount of stress, you know, everyone's stressed right now.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.160]   If you don't have a job,
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.000]   you're stressed at the idea of finding one.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:58.840]   Right.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.560]   If you do have a job, you're stressed at the idea
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.880]   of keeping it, continuing to perform.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.600]   So, you know, it's like the stress levels are
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.760]   through the roof right now,
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.600]   and, you know, it's just,
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.000]   I'm, you know, the thing that I'm doing,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.880]   I am trying to be kinder in,
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.880]   I like it, you know, in special,
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.680]   in, you know, especially in social media context,
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.400]   where it's easy to be flip and sarcastic and,
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.120]   and all, and I'm, you know,
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:35.280]   I'm trying to, you know, move the needle the other direction
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.720]   a little bit and say, thank you to people
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.320]   and give people the benefit of the doubt
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.200]   over their motives.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.520]   I like that.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.480]   You can set a block, you know, everything.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.040]   Do you notice the Twitter is a nicer place?
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.480]   At all. A little bit.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.320]   Yeah, a little bit.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.000]   Lexi, does it seem nicer?
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.840]   Oops, that's not Lexi.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.760]   Lexi, does it seem nicer to you these days?
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:00.880]   I have actually been making a kind of a concerted effort
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   to only be on Twitter very, for brief periods of the day.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.680]   Just, it's, it's just so much information.
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.240]   And just my entire feeds are just COVID-19.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.760]   And so there's parts of that I want to know about.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.600]   And then there's other parts that just become so overwhelming
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.720]   that I need to just turn it off
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.560]   and actually have the mental space to be like,
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.600]   okay, I need to concentrate on what I have to do.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.840]   Otherwise, I feel like I would fall into the,
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.160]   the great Twitter vortex,
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.280]   which is probably okay in normal times,
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.200]   but now I think I need that space.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.400]   So I don't think I can really judge whether or not
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.560]   it's a better place right now.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.600]   It's just a lot of information.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.200]   Do you use Twitter, Seth?
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.720]   Yeah, yeah, @SethR.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.760]   That's a good one.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.600]   I like it.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.720]   Yeah, I had a worse one.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.080]   And then years ago, Twitter let me switch
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.960]   because the person who had it wasn't using it.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:58.960]   So I've been @SethR now for longer than not.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:01.240]   Do you notice that as Ed Bott has
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.080]   that people are a little gentler these days on Twitter
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:04.920]   to each other?
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.000]   I hope we are.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.040]   Oh, have you seen Infosec Twitter?
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:08.880]   I mean, it's...
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.440]   (laughing)
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.280]   Is it brutal?
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.880]   And just to be clear,
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.200]   I was talking about my own personal behavior.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.480]   I'm not saying, I'm, you know,
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.640]   like I said, mute, not block.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.720]   That's, you know, that's, I'm muting,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.480]   I'm muting a fair number of people
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.040]   and I'm responding to them with
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   comments that suggest that their remarks were in good faith.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640]   If I think they would...
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   See, that's a difference.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.200]   Yeah, 'cause what usually happens on Twitter is you go,
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.040]   "What do you mean?"
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.040]   And then the rain's up.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.040]   Oh, it escalates.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   You go from zero to 60 in, you know, 3.2 milliseconds.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.280]   Nobody assumes good faith on Twitter.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.560]   I've always had a very difficult time focusing
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:02.320]   on the seven bazillion important tasks I need to focus on
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.680]   and doing Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.320]   I just, I'm really bad at it.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.320]   So, see, the problem that I have now is that you get more
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:17.680]   up to date, more and more easily verifiable information
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.760]   from Twitter than you will from news reports.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.560]   It's just, you know, it's the nature
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.680]   of what the two different beasts are.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.440]   Simultaneously better and worse.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   Yeah, I mean, you have to pick your,
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.040]   you have to pick your, you know, who you're following.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.600]   But like following, you know, like I'm doing a story
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.240]   on biohackers who are helping out with the various coronavirus
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:46.360]   efforts and it's important for me to, you know,
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.560]   to also like figure out who actually knows what they're
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.200]   talking about and who's just scrambling to, you know,
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.600]   to 3D print something that may not even be useful.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.720]   There's a lot of challenges.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.240]   I follow a couple of epidemiologists.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.400]   I follow more politicians now than I really feel comfortable
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.400]   doing.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.800]   But, you know, you have to hear and see what people are saying
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:13.520]   because a lot of it needs to be debunked or even is accurate
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.760]   at the time of posting and then is incorrect 24 hours later
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.800]   or has changed 24 hours later.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.840]   So it's, it's hard right now.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:26.120]   I'm curious what you think about this.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.080]   China, according to the Financial Times, has unveiled
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.880]   a new proposal for reinventing the internet.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.320]   They've proposed this to the ITU, the International
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.640]   Telecommunications Union.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.840]   It's being spearheaded by Huawei, Chinese company,
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.120]   and in fact, FutureWay, which is a Silicon Valley-based
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.920]   think tank and a research arm of Huawei.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.960]   They made this proposal together with China Unicom
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.600]   and China Telecom, the country's Ministry of Industry
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.960]   and Information Technology.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.120]   The Financial Times got the PowerPoint presentation
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.680]   for something China calls new IP.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.400]   I don't know if we need a new IP to replace TCP.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.360]   They said that the infrastructure is unstable,
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.680]   vastly insufficient.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.520]   And they suggested that the ITU should take the long-term view
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.800]   and shoulder the responsibility for a top-down design
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.160]   of the future network.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.400]   One of the reasons they want to do this,
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:37.040]   there's a new feature in new IP that Chinese calls shut up,
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.600]   which would be--
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.960]   it's aptly named.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.000]   It would be useful on Twitter.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.520]   It allows-- it's a top-down, by the way, governmental run
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.320]   internet.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.280]   It would allow whoever's running the internet
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.360]   in that country to take anybody offline,
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.760]   to restrict communications between two different IP
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.320]   addresses, or just to say, hey, you, you're not
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.000]   on the internet anymore.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.040]   And I have to feeling this is the main reason--
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.960]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.960]   But I mean, so two different things.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.400]   Two different things here.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:18.400]   Number one, the statement of problem there is 100% accurate.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.240]   The internet was never designed to be what it has become today.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.880]   DNS was never designed to be a directory.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:33.400]   And so the internet is just a god-awful mess today.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.760]   But a top-down government-imposed solution
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.080]   that gives central authority the ability
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:49.760]   to arbitrarily cut off access to a single node
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.760]   on the internet with surgical precision.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:59.720]   Basically, an online drone strike is not the answer.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.760]   Absolutely.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.320]   You could see why the answer.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.800]   China would love this, though, right?
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.360]   The ability to shut down dissent on the internet.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.160]   And you could also see why other countries might kind of fall
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.280]   for it, because for a variety of reasons.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.400]   Well, we could do--
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.680]   This is why the Earned Act is rushing through Congress
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.440]   so that we can control child abuse online.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.800]   I think one of the most important statements
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.480]   about the internet, as it exists today,
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.400]   is the aphorism that is absolutely true.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.560]   The internet interprets censorship as damage
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.080]   and routes around it.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.640]   That's the real problem.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   And that's the good part about the internet.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.960]   But there's so many bad parts that go with it.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:52.520]   But honestly, the idea that somebody is going to come in,
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.960]   top down, and invent a better internet.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.320]   Especially in China.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.000]   No.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.480]   Well, yeah, no.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.440]   One of the scary things I can totally foresee quite easily
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:10.680]   is China creating this internet, which for all we know,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.000]   is the internet that their internet is based on,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.560]   or at least what they're trying to achieve,
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.520]   with their implementation of the internet already.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.520]   And then mandates that if you want to do trade with China,
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.600]   or if you want Chinese dollars for whatever infrastructure
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.640]   project you have going on, you're
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.040]   going to have to use this internet as well.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:35.280]   I don't think that is terribly hard to imagine happening.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.360]   I do think, however, that we are underestimating
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.080]   the coronavirus impact.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:44.040]   And we don't know what's going to come out.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.920]   And when we have gotten through this globally.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.640]   So it worries me that China is talking about this.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.760]   But it also worries me that we're
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.840]   seeing government organizations trying
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.080]   to do an end run on section 230 with the internet act.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.480]   So this is highly concerning.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.200]   But also, we don't know how things
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.800]   are going to be in China when coronavirus returns there.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.120]   If they will be as successful as before in Tampang Down
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.600]   on it, we don't know, as we mentioned,
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:21.440]   if they've been misleading about their numbers,
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.480]   their infection rates.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:26.800]   So it sounds like a really bad idea.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.240]   And I could see China making it a thing.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.760]   But--
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.120]   One hope, see, I'll just--
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:35.000]   I'm smarter about this.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:35.520]   Well, it depends.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.120]   I mean, if someone wants to buy--
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.080]   what was the top level domain that was it.org?
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.960]   That's one try to sell--
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.960]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.520]   --like a million dollars or something.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.080]   That was obviously a bad idea.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.240]   So how did-- how that happened in the first places?
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.240]   That doesn't give me any confidence in China proposing
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.360]   a government run internet.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.000]   Well, and that happened not to get too lost in the weeds
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.640]   there.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.320]   But that happened because of financial pressures
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.640]   that I can, right?
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640]   Right.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.840]   Right.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.080]   And if they--
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.200]   I mean, it's sort of--
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.280]   I can-- is to the internet, as the Postal Service
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.080]   is to the United States.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:34.120]   And they're both, in theory, not pure capitalist institutions.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:37.560]   But in practice, they have to act like them
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:42.560]   because otherwise they go bankrupt and can't do their jobs
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.360]   and pay their people and deliver the bits or the envelopes
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.560]   and magazines depending on which side you're talking about.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:56.520]   And so it's back to what you said, Seth, at the beginning.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.920]   Once you get into a capitalist system here,
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.560]   especially in a time of stress like this,
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:07.640]   a lot of flaws in the underlying infrastructure
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.960]   become really obvious.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.080]   There is, at the Sands Internet Storm Center,
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:22.480]   a COVID-19 domain classifier, partly
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.400]   because there's so many malicious sites.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:31.000]   What they're asking people to do is to log into a site.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.480]   There's a whole database of sites.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.280]   You can help them out with.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.760]   And determine whether it's a malicious site,
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:41.920]   whether it's a site full of misinformation,
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.520]   and then report back.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.560]   So if you want to help the Sands folks--
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.160]   Insights Internet Storm Center.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.440]   You can go to isc.sands.edu and help them
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.000]   with their COVID-19 domain classifier.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.200]   That's really interesting.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.840]   I guess so many domains have been registered.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.000]   And they're trying to figure out which are for scams,
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:07.840]   which are for illegal.
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.600]   They're trying to enlist volunteers.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.000]   Now, they say, as part of this task,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.720]   you'll need to visit possibly malicious websites.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.440]   Currently-- I don't know who I is.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.880]   Whoever's writing this says, I haven't seen any outright
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.200]   malicious content malware, but there
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.960]   are a few thousand domains on the list.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.320]   It's likely that a couple of them will carry malware.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.680]   So take precautions.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.360]   Use a separate system of virtual machine or a mobile device
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.720]   that can be reset and has no personal information.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:38.400]   It may work well.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.360]   So use a safe computer, classify it,
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.720]   and go to the next one.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.760]   This is kind of an interesting community effort
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.480]   to weed out misinformation and actively malicious sites being
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.000]   put together by the Sands Institute.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.920]   If anything comes out of all of this,
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:59.480]   I hope it is that on the ground level,
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:03.960]   there's more cooperation between smaller organizations,
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.520]   more cooperation between individuals.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.360]   I mean, that's what the promise of all this technology
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.840]   is about and why so many people are into it.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:22.000]   But using it for the kinds of self-aggrandizing
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.480]   and ego stroking that's been happening and tearing people down,
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.320]   I think really doesn't serve any purpose.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:38.800]   And if just security researchers alone can come together
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.960]   more than they have and get better at sharing
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:45.560]   the information they have on threats,
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.160]   that alone, I think, would be enormous in--
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.160]   Is that a group of people?
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.440]   Is that a group of people who are rivals and fight together?
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.800]   Well, you would hope that you were cooperative.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.440]   I don't know.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.400]   I mean, I think there are a lot who are cooperative.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:06.880]   I certainly, in the coronavirus era,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.200]   we've seen people come together sharing
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:14.320]   across international borders 3D models
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:17.560]   for different kind of mask holders
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.840]   where you can insert a reusable cloth, but the mask frame--
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.840]   Well, that's a good idea.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.000]   --states the same.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.440]   We've seen ventilator widgets being 3D printed,
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.840]   and those are getting shared.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:38.400]   But this sense of infighting has, at times,
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.560]   prevented different researchers from being
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.440]   able to share information, whether or not they wanted to.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.560]   This is an opportunity.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.560]   I agree with you, an opportunity to get together,
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:54.720]   and we need to all work together to get out of this hole.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.560]   No time to be fighting, fussing, and feuding.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.200]   I want to take a break, and then I
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.880]   will talk about a couple of fights going on
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.360]   in the open source area, Arena.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.280]   Our sponsor for this segment of this week in tech
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:13.400]   is a life insurance agency that specializes
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:17.480]   in getting insurance for people who are healthy.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.200]   You might say, well, yeah, but you can really save
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.440]   a lot of money if you are doing everything right for your health,
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.760]   if you exercise regularly.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.080]   If you get a minimum of eight hours of sleep,
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.720]   I know that's hard these days.
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.400]   Maybe you're eating right.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.600]   Basically, you're ensuring a longer life.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.040]   That means you should get a better deal on life insurance.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.480]   But a lot of life insurance companies,
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.120]   you're just a number to them.
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.920]   And so they don't know that you're a healthy person.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.120]   That's where a health IQ comes in.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.040]   A life insurance agency that uses science and data
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.240]   to get lower life insurance rates for healthy people like you.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:56.080]   You can get a million dollars as an example,
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:59.440]   a million dollars policy from 36 bucks a month.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.760]   See, what's happened all along is the people
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.680]   who are healthy, subsidized, unhealthy people.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:05.600]   It's not a conspiracy.
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.040]   It's statistics.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.160]   It's actuarial science.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:10.480]   That's how life insurance works.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:13.560]   You might be healthy, but your life insurance company doesn't know.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.440]   But if you are, if you're a runner, a cyclist,
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.200]   you're in a crossfit, you're a vegetarian or a vegan,
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.480]   you deserve to be rewarded for your hard work
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:23.000]   with more affordable life insurance rates.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.920]   Physically active people have significantly lower risks
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.240]   for heart disease, for cancer, for diabetes.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.480]   And that's where health IQ comes in.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:31.920]   They're a concierge life insurance agency.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.720]   They give you a white glove service.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.480]   They walk you through the entire process of applying.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:40.840]   They work with the top 30 insurance companies in the country.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.880]   So these are good companies and they have pre-negotiated,
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.440]   better rates, rates you can't get anywhere else
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.880]   for people who are healthy.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.320]   They've got exclusive rates for health IQ.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.560]   Now, the trick is you gotta qualify.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.760]   Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, everybody can get into this.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.960]   So here's what you do.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.120]   You take the health IQ quiz at healthIQ.com/twit.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:07.160]   It's a knowledge assessment, not a self assessment.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:10.160]   They put together a team of the nation's leading medical,
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.880]   health and fitness experts to create this quiz.
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.800]   It's actually a lot of fun to take.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.800]   Depending on your score, plus other related qualifying factors,
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.080]   you can save up to 41% in your life insurance premiums
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.160]   compared to other providers.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:25.800]   You'd be crazy not to do this.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:26.960]   There's no commitment.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.080]   You're gonna learn a lot more about other opportunities
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:32.120]   to be rewarded because you care about healthy living.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.760]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.320]   Let health IQs concierge service guide you
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.440]   toward getting the life insurance you deserve.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.520]   Go to healthIQ.com/twit.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.800]   Take the health IQ quiz.
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.360]   Once you complete it, they'll call you.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.440]   The team will walk you through the process
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.320]   and you can save a lot of money on your life insurance.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:52.760]   There's no reason not to try this.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.680]   There's no cost, no obligation.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:55.720]   See how much you could save?
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.600]   Go to healthIQ.com/twit.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.600]   HealthIQ.com/twit.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.440]   A few more stories before we wrap this up.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.880]   Let's see here.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.840]   The Library of Congress, I think this is nice,
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.920]   has opened up its collection of open access books.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:20.920]   I think it's 1.7 million volumes of open access books.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:22.640]   There's actually a lot of collections.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.400]   There's Project Gutenberg out there.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.760]   But some of the Library of Congress stuff
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.600]   is more recent, Corey Doctorow's Little Brother,
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.000]   which is a great young adult story
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.600]   about the surveillance economy.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:37.120]   A book I would highly recommend,
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.600]   "Bankler's Wealth of Networks" is fascinating.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.120]   Pop City, Korean popular culture and the selling of place.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.840]   All of this from the Library of Congress website.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.120]   And this is all legal.
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:54.480]   There is some dispute though over the internet archive,
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.760]   doing something similar.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.400]   Did you follow this?
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.800]   The internet archive has been taken,
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:02.840]   first of all, disclaimer, love the internet archive.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.160]   I support them.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.480]   They are preserving our internet history,
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.600]   downloading, I don't know how much they do every day,
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:13.240]   but terabytes of data, which they store,
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.760]   otherwise would be lost.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.720]   Every Geocities site ever is there.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:19.480]   If you've ever used the Wayback Machine,
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:21.880]   you've used the internet archive.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.680]   They also scan books.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.960]   Now this has been very controversial.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:29.120]   Remember when Google did this, the authors guild sued.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.160]   There was a legal opinion,
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:36.440]   some time ago that said
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.760]   a digital copy could be put online
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.880]   for every print copy any library owned,
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.160]   but you had to do it like a library.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:47.960]   You could only lend out one per copy you owned.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.360]   So there wouldn't be more, you know,
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.920]   a thousand copies of one book out there.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:53.880]   And you had to have an expiration, you know,
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.040]   a due date and all of that.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.400]   Because of COVID starting March 24th,
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.600]   the internet archive suspended the wait lists
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.120]   for its 1.4 million book library.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.560]   They created what they called the National Emergency Library
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.720]   to serve the nation's displaced learners.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:14.920]   They say the suspension of rules
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:18.320]   will run through June 30th of this year
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.980]   or the end of the emergency, whichever is later.
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.340]   During the wait list suspension,
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.100]   users will be able to borrow books
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:26.460]   from the internet archive
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.740]   without joining a wait list and string.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:29.580]   Sounds good.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.460]   Students will have access to assigned readings
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:33.940]   and library materials that the internet archive
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.420]   is digitized for the remainder of the US academic year.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.940]   People who cannot physically access their local libraries
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:41.980]   because of closure or self-quarantine
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.640]   continue to read and thrive.
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:47.780]   The authors are pissed.
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:49.460]   (laughing)
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.340]   That's an understatement.
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:56.340]   The authors say this is a pirate website.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.580]   It's not legit NPR apparently.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:00.240]   Publicize this on Twitter.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:03.740]   Earning them the wrath.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:07.220]   The wrath of the authors Guild and many authors,
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:11.180]   Mark Wonderlick said this is piracy, plain and simple.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.940]   Your local library can get you e-books
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:14.700]   once they've paid for.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.140]   What do you think?
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.700]   It is a national emergency.
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.700]   I think the internet archived as the work of the angels.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:23.260]   Have they gone too far?
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.020]   So I'm a member of the authors Guild.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.740]   I get checks.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:29.980]   I get checks from the authors Guild every year
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:34.700]   for royalties, for use of my books
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:38.540]   in various libraries and academic systems and such.
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:41.220]   And I think this is awesome.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:43.860]   I want it, I want it to happen.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:48.100]   We're in uncharted waters right now.
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:53.100]   The idea that everyone should be entitled
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:58.020]   to extract their rent from the economic system right now,
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:00.460]   sorry, off the books.
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.540]   This is great.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.020]   Do it, go read.
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.540]   If one of my books happens to be there,
[02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:09.140]   you have my blessing to go read it
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:11.300]   and I won't take a penny from it
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:13.500]   and I won't feel bad about it, period.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.100]   Thank you, Ed Bot.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.380]   Thank you.
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:18.740]   I understand why authors would be perturbed,
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:21.700]   but it only goes through June 30th, right?
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:25.620]   This is not a power grab from the internet archives.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:27.780]   There are a lot of kids at home
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.700]   who could probably benefit from this.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.580]   I'm not a member of the authors Guild
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:34.500]   so I don't have a dog in this hunt.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:37.500]   I saw that story
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:41.340]   and the thing that I don't recall it answering
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:44.180]   or maybe it just wasn't answered in the version I read
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:49.180]   is how many works that they've been scanning
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:54.960]   are, sorry,
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.280]   (laughing)
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.120]   - Orphan works.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:57.960]   - Orphan works.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:58.800]   - How many, yeah.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.220]   - How many are, well, no, it's the opposite.
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.620]   How many are copy written?
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:05.360]   How many are still under active copyright?
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.620]   - Well, the thing that probably
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:10.620]   the Orphan works is because we've extended copyright
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.380]   thanks to Mickey Mouse and Disney,
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:15.980]   we've extended copyright for so long
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.780]   that anything 75 years old or younger is copyright,
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:23.180]   but they may be what we call orphan works
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:24.700]   where the authors long gone,
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:25.900]   the books are out of print,
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.260]   nobody's gonna make any money on those books.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:29.620]   They're lost.
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:33.460]   This is what Google was trying to do with the scanning effort.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.140]   In fact, there were even proposals that,
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.020]   well, how about this?
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.940]   How about we say, if we think it's an orphan work,
[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:45.100]   if the author wants us not to do this, send us a dollar,
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.540]   you know, $1 and we won't do it,
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:50.700]   proving the ownership and petting a little bit of a roast,
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:53.580]   speed bump over just saying, yeah, don't do it.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.100]   - I think the internet archive could have avoided
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:01.860]   a lot of the drama over this by simply making it opt in,
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:04.540]   by saying if an author reached out to them--
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:05.380]   - That's the problem.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:06.220]   - I mean, if the-- - If the problem
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:09.860]   was orphan works, nobody knows who the author's long gone.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:11.940]   - There's no-- - Aren't those public domain?
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.180]   - No. - I mean, if they're public domain--
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:15.020]   - No, it's not. - No, they're not.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.780]   It's a weird--
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:20.860]   - We're not interested in the-- - I live in the weeds
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:21.740]   of copyright. - It's not.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.300]   - Yeah, it's-- - Yeah.
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.380]   - And the real thing is,
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:30.140]   this is not taking money out of the pockets
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:32.500]   of people who need it.
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.020]   It's just not.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:37.460]   You know, this is the books that are here,
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.740]   the people who are downloading these books
[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:44.380]   would not have paid to buy these books
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:48.020]   and sent their 10% or 15% or whatever,
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:50.780]   the royalty percentages off to the authors.
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:54.220]   In general, these are things that people
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:57.740]   would have either pirated or not read.
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:00.580]   You know, the idea that this is taking money
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.580]   out of the pockets of authors is ludicrous.
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:09.900]   This is a 1925 book, so still in copyright,
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:12.660]   for one more year of--
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:15.980]   It's called German Lyrics and Ballads
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:18.220]   from Clopsstock to Modern Times,
[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:20.740]   Modern Times being 1925.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:24.180]   This, you know, you can see this book was discarded
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.380]   from a library.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:31.380]   From the Port Wayne and Allen County Indiana Library,
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.460]   as far as I can tell, I don't see the card,
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.260]   but I bet you wasn't checked out a whole heck of a lot.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:43.340]   Yeah, but somebody might want this for researchers,
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.700]   so student might want it.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.660]   I mean, I think this is, well, I don't know.
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:52.660]   For works that have some kind of clear authorship,
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:56.660]   I don't see a problem if in an archive puts up
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:59.860]   some kind of donation that goes back to the authors guild,
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.860]   if that makes the guild happy.
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:03.860]   Well, I know they're not guilds now.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:06.060]   That's a different kind of one.
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:09.060]   I mean, the law is on the authors guild side.
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:09.900]   Yeah.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.060]   Nobody's disputing that.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.900]   Dog attack.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:13.900]   Dog attack.
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:20.300]   Come on, Lexi, you want a dog, don't you?
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.300]   I do.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.140]   Come on.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.300]   Go to Muttville.
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:25.500]   Zero's the second dog I've gotten from Muttville.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:29.340]   If you're in San Francisco, it's a senior dog rescue.
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:31.140]   Maybe your land--
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:36.140]   Maybe your landlord would agree to a three-week foster.
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.500]   It is a special time, right?
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:40.420]   It is exactly.
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:41.420]   It's a special time.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:43.860]   You just say, three weeks, six-week foster.
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:47.180]   You know, because fostering dogs is--
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.260]   You could--
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:51.300]   Both of our dogs, both of the dogs that we've had,
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.140]   well, we've lived here in Santa Fe,
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:56.780]   have come to us from people who fostered them.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.020]   Oh, okay.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.740]   And they came to their forever homes here.
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:03.820]   Nice.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:07.540]   But they were fostered by other people
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:13.820]   who kept them for a week or two or three,
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:17.660]   so that they didn't have to go upstate.
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:22.900]   Lexi, is it an Australian shepherd you're looking for?
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:24.980]   No, I'm not ready.
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:26.980]   What would you like?
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:29.780]   I never sort of realized the obsession with Australian shepherds.
[02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:31.620]   They're great dogs.
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:34.500]   Beautiful dogs, but not that many people have them in Australia.
[02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:36.900]   So, well, at least not in my experience.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:40.020]   I would definitely look any rescue dog.
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:41.380]   I need a big dog. I'm tall.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:43.180]   So I need a big dog, otherwise carrying it.
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:43.980]   I need little dog.
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:44.620]   No.
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.620]   Yeah.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:51.740]   So, Bernice Mountain Dogs, I am tall.
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.300]   Those are huge.
[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:54.860]   Don't like them.
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:56.460]   They are horses.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.180]   But they are the mellowest dogs.
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:03.820]   They need very little physical activity.
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:06.380]   They need five pounds of food a day.
[02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:10.220]   The energy of the dog is an inverse proportion to its size.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.500]   And they leave three pounds of...
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:14.700]   Yeah, right.
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.980]   Bring a shovel and a bucket.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:18.460]   I'm just saying, though,
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:22.460]   that they're very calm, relaxed mellow dogs
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.300]   that don't need a lot of activity,
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:26.300]   that don't need a lot of...
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:27.340]   They don't need to...
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:29.740]   I mean, we have Springer Spaniels.
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:31.660]   Those are very jumpy dogs.
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:33.820]   They're very twitchy dogs.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:38.140]   And the reason that Lucy went to the dog park this afternoon
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:40.940]   is because if she doesn't go to the dog park,
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:44.220]   she's bouncing off the walls.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:46.380]   And she's almost 12 years old.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:46.860]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:48.940]   Well, this is why I recommend Mutville.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:52.860]   So, my first dog was a pit bull mix from Mutville Athena.
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:57.500]   I had to rename the dogs because everything is great about Mutville,
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:59.660]   but they give the worst shelter names.
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:02.300]   And so Athena was great.
[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:05.500]   She was in her twilight years
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:09.180]   and we had a good year and a half plus together.
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:13.020]   And pit bull mix, not a small dog.
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:21.500]   And then I adopted zero and zero is a black lab mix.
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:26.540]   Probably Border Collie is the other half of her.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:30.300]   But don't you think adopting a dog that's in his last legs is kind of...
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.380]   No, it's wonderful.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.420]   It's wonderful.
[02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:38.460]   No, it's wonderful because these dogs are so happy to have another place to go.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:40.540]   They are so thrilled that they're in a hole...
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.260]   Absolutely.
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:42.700]   ...that they're getting fed.
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:43.100]   I just...
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:47.900]   The only tactical error I made with zero was that I didn't realize that I had to buy running shoes
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:52.140]   to go with her and she's 11 and a half.
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:57.740]   And for over a year we do five miles a day in Golden Gate Park and I'm just...
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:59.100]   You're a great shade.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:07:59.580]   Yeah.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.220]   I'm getting there.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:00.780]   I'm getting there.
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:03.100]   There's a lot that needed to change.
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:06.220]   You my friend, you could wear tights if you wanted to come visit.
[02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:07.260]   We...
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:08.460]   No one needs to see that.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:11.580]   One last story.
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:13.660]   I thought we should end with a happy story.
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:16.540]   The Elizabeth Warren for president campaign is over, but
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:18.620]   I think this is great.
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:23.180]   They're open sourcing all the 2020 campaign tech they created.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:25.820]   Public...
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:29.100]   They're going to make public all the apps, all the digital tools.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:32.380]   They use a lot of open source technology and they're re...
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:33.420]   And they're recon...
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:36.300]   You know, contributing that open source technology back.
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:41.740]   There was a nice medium post by members of the team, including chief technology strategist,
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:45.020]   Mike Conlow and CTO Nikki Sutton.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.780]   And they talked about all of the software.
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:50.220]   They're going to make available to any campaign they want to use it.
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:53.020]   I think this is exactly the idea behind open source.
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:53.820]   And I'm really...
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.420]   I think that's a really great thing to do.
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:09:00.780]   They have spoke a peer-to-peer texting platform originally developed by move on.
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:03.580]   Polaris, a polling location, look up tool.
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:09.740]   Caucus app to help caucus captains calculate.
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.900]   Take good views that in Iowa.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:13.020]   Calculate the votes.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.780]   Switchboard.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:17.260]   But it's really interesting.
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:19.820]   There's a lot of these days campaigns are very high tech.
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:21.660]   There's a lot of software out there.
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:22.140]   Red hook.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:26.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time for everybody to go home,
[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:30.460]   find a dog, cuddle up, watch Tiger King.
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:32.540]   Any of you watching Tiger King on Netflix?
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:33.100]   Not yet.
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:34.060]   Not yet.
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:34.940]   It's all the rage.
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:36.220]   Gary.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:37.500]   Have you seen it?
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:38.460]   Have you seen it Lexi?
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.820]   Best episode.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.660]   So I'm only just starting it now.
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:42.860]   I'm trying not to binge it.
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:44.460]   I know I want to binge it.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.140]   So we get Outlander tonight.
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:50.620]   Better call Saul tomorrow.
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:55.180]   So those two things are keeping us.
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.700]   They're keeping us.
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.420]   The Sunday, Monday access is pretty solid right now.
[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:04.940]   Yeah, we were watching The Outsider, which had a, wow, that was a wild rock.
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:05.420]   The original?
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:12.220]   No, they made the Stephen King movie into a, I think, an eight part or ten part mini series
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:13.900]   on HBO.
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:14.940]   It was very well done.
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.060]   It was very good, I think.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:16.460]   Yeah.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:17.580]   So we've been watching that.
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:20.780]   I just finished, what was it?
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:22.460]   Hunters.
[02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:24.700]   Oh my god, is that wild?
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:30.940]   Oh, I have, I could rant about that for a very long time.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:32.940]   I have problems with that.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:34.060]   Loved Pacino though.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:36.140]   Pacino was stellar.
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:37.660]   The Italian Jewish guy.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:37.980]   Wow.
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:38.860]   Wow.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:43.660]   I've got, yeah, I'm too sober to rant about it.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:47.740]   But, and then I finished up Picard and-
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:48.380]   What do you think?
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.100]   Because I haven't watched that yet and I think I can watch it for free now.
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:52.140]   I think they've put it on.
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:56.220]   Yeah, CBS made it free until the end of, until the end of April.
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:57.500]   Should I leap in?
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:00.300]   Because I'm a Star Trek fan, but not a huge fan.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:06.540]   If you love Star Trek or if you love watching Patrick Stewart II's scenery,
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.100]   he's great.
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.620]   He's phenomenal.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:16.540]   There's a lot of fan service in this, in the show.
[02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:20.380]   And I feel like this is the case with a lot of these bit shows that you can binge,
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.980]   where they're not tight.
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:24.700]   They're very rare of who the audience is, aren't they?
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:27.420]   They're, and they're written for 45 minutes or an hour.
[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:32.460]   This was a huge problem, I thought, in Hunters, where it just, it really needed an editor to
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:34.940]   sit down and slash through 40% of it.
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:37.340]   That was the problem with Picard.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:42.140]   It's just, you know, the camera has never met a view of Patrick Stewart that it didn't like.
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:44.860]   Any thoughts on Westworld, the new season three?
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:46.860]   Haven't checked out yet.
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:47.900]   Haven't started yet.
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:48.620]   Can't watch it.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:52.380]   Why can't you, what are you going to, you save in it for binging or you just?
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.100]   No, no, no, no.
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:56.780]   We skipped, we stopped it at the end of season one.
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:58.460]   It was pretty awful.
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.420]   It was pretty awful.
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:05.420]   Well, and also, no one's desire to do everything out of order.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:10.540]   In fact, before I started season three, I watched two different YouTube
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:14.060]   chronological recaps, so they rearranged everything.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.220]   And I'm more confused.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:17.980]   I'm more confused.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:19.260]   It was, it's insane.
[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:23.020]   There's like a hundred years between the beginning and the end.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:25.740]   I'll just go back and watch Memento one more time.
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:28.460]   Just to, if I won't, I love that stuff.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.900]   Chronological incongruence.
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:36.380]   I'll go back and watch Memento one more time, but we seem to be getting that
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:38.300]   in our daily life.
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:38.780]   Yeah.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:39.340]   Yeah.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:39.820]   Yeah.
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:42.220]   I, you know, the, I had the same feeling.
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.940]   I watched the first episode and we've had the second now.
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.500]   The first episode was actually pretty good.
[02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:52.700]   I thought, oh, finally we're up in the future now and the robots have escaped,
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:54.460]   but then they went back to Westworld and I thought,
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:58.700]   this again, been there, done that.
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:12:59.980]   We can't have nice things.
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:01.420]   Ed bot, we can have you.
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:02.140]   And thank goodness.
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.060]   Ed bot is a very nice person.
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:05.180]   We love him.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:08.540]   Ed bot, does the Ed bot report on ZD net?
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.900]   He's Ed Ed bot on Twitter.
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:13.420]   Stay well, stay healthy there in beautiful Santa Fe.
[02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:14.540]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:18.460]   Ed, I've known Ed for almost three decades now.
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:19.100]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.820]   It's, it's pretty damn close to 30 years, Leo.
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:22.060]   Yeah.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.580]   Wow.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:25.260]   A 30 good year.
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.940]   30 very good years.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:30.140]   I think I met you, John introduced us, Devore.
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:33.420]   He introduced us in the maybe 93 or 94.
[02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:35.100]   So it's been 27 years.
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:37.820]   And every moment of it, I've enjoyed.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.340]   Thank you, Ed. I appreciate it.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:43.660]   I hope I'm around to enjoy Lexi Savittis for 27 years.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:48.300]   I'll be in my 90s, but it's good to know you Lexi.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.740]   Senior editor at CNET at Lexi Savittis on the Twitter.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:55.340]   And don't forget, your videos are so good on CNET.
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:56.380]   I just love them.
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:58.620]   And I want to see more cooking videos from you.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:00.940]   Yeah, well, Instagram every day.
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.900]   That's where they, they run in a YouTube too.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.980]   I'm joining Instagram just to see those.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:08.380]   I think that I think about it.
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:09.740]   Instagram would be nice in this.
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:12.140]   If it, if it's, if they're doing a lot of, you know,
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:14.460]   cocooning stuff, I would, I would enjoy Instagram.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:16.060]   Everyone's cooking.
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:17.340]   Everyone's just being kind.
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:21.340]   It's all about local community and just being in touch with people that I
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:23.340]   haven't been in touch with fridges.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.660]   It's, it's like a much nicer Facebook.
[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:26.140]   Yes.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.660]   It's my, my Facebook, but.
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.140]   Yeah.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:30.220]   Well, that's why, that's why I took it off my phone.
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:31.340]   I took everything.
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:33.740]   What's app Facebook, Instagram off my phone?
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.100]   I do miss Instagram.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.420]   And maybe this is the right time to go back.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:40.060]   Yeah, it's like the Facebook boomerangas, you know,
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.820]   Instagram boomerangas come back around.
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:42.860]   I'm a boomeranger.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:43.660]   This.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.740]   Okay, boomeranger.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:46.300]   It's okay.
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:47.340]   You can say.
[02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:51.740]   And Seth always a pleasure.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:52.620]   Thank you so much.
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:57.580]   Seth Rosenblatt is the EIC at the dash parallax.com
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:59.580]   @SethR on the Twitter.
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.820]   Always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.260]   Check out, check out my story tomorrow in Fast Company
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:07.260]   on the last tech conference standing.
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:12.860]   You went to the last one, you brave person, you and two others.
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:15.100]   I think that's hysterical.
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:18.620]   There were, no, there were, there were, yeah, there were three attendees.
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:23.500]   There were about five or six staffers and there was one journalist.
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.500]   That's pretty amazing.
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:28.860]   We do, I don't know what we're going to do next week.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:30.700]   We're really running out of stories here.
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:34.940]   The tech industry is just basically shut down.
[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:37.900]   I'm telling you, I think we might do cooking next week.
[02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:39.180]   But I hope you will come by.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.820]   We'll keep you company no matter what is going on.

[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:22.220]   We're starting to do a lot of those little short shows

[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.700]   Another Twit is in the can.
