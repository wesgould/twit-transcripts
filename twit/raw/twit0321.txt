[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:46.580]   It's time for TWIT, the show that covers the tech news of the week gone by. Unfortunately,
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.060]   we had a little mishap in the factory and we're all going to have to talk like this.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.260]   Wally Baloo.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.340]   Because, yes, because then when it comes out, it will sound adorable. Do you mind, John,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.820]   talking like this for the rest of the show?
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.460]   Oh, I'm glad that you came in to do this.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460]   Up cut John C. Dvorak, ladies and gentlemen, from channeldvorak.com.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.020]   Hello.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   Yeah. We call him Mr. Freeze because he's so cool. Also here, my buddy from the screensavers,
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.100]   Mr. Patrick Norton. Also, I guess I should give you credit for the new thing, techzilla.com.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   And don't forget Twitch.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.180]   And this week in Kapoor Hardware. You know, it's funny because we actually had last week,
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.780]   even though you do that show remotely via Skype with Ryan Shroud, who's in Kentucky,
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.460]   we had people show up in the audience to watch.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.700]   It was awesome. I tweeted out a picture. There were these four, two monitors, four seats.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.220]   And I think...
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.820]   A little Q&A.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.500]   I think it was because when you and Ryan did the show here live, it was so good. It was
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.740]   so good. It was like the screensavers. And we had a top-down shot as you took apart a
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.060]   computer. I mean, it really felt great.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.700]   It was fun.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.260]   It makes me want to do more of that kind of stuff.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.820]   Just need to get Ryan out of Kentucky and into California.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.180]   That's what we got to do.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.060]   And then he looked at the cost of a house and started laughing and got back on the plane.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.820]   It's my goal to get everybody to move to Petaluma as quick as I can. John, you like that? That's
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.980]   the galaxy.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.020]   It's worth worse places than Petaluma. Petaluma, if anyone wants to travel around, I would
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.940]   recommend a quick trip to Petaluma.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.580]   What do you say, live studio audience? There's a bunch of people here.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.580]   Gorgeous little place.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.740]   It's really nice. This is a great group of people here from AppAdvice. We've got somebody
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.740]   visiting. We've got Mike Chandler, my old webmaster, is here. That goes back a ways.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.380]   Steve Buchanan is visiting from Oracle. You know what it is? It's Java One's in town.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.060]   So there's people coming...
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.180]   It's in Petaluma.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.180]   Yes, it is.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.980]   I would have figured the butter and egg festival.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.780]   And also let's introduce Mr. Dan Patterson, who hasn't been on in ages. And I apologize,
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.020]   Dan, from ABC Radio.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.380]   Quite all right. Thank you very much, Leo.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.420]   You've been tearing it up on the Google+.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.420]   On the Google+ and on the streets of New York City. Although I did spend... I lived in Sebastopol,
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.060]   California.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.580]   No.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.940]   On Main Street. Yeah, I used to. I worked for Capitol Records and the majority of my
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.780]   income came from Copperfield's books down there on Main Street, Sebastopol.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.300]   And they're in Petaluma. They're a block from here.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.580]   Yeah, yeah. O'Reilly was one of our biggest customers. It was pre-Web 2.0.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.580]   Wow. And look at this picture of you on your Google+.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.060]   I should have changed that.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.460]   Hey, Loreen, also from the North Coast Macintosh Users Group. Loreen's visiting us. She's the
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.500]   president of the club. There's a good bunch of people in here.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.060]   There's users groups left.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.580]   Yeah. Oh, you know what? I met people from two users groups. It was Jay, right? It was
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.500]   from Colorado, Loreen, right? And he says that's the biggest user group in the world.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.300]   I don't know. You have about three or four hundred?
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   We have over 500.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.220]   500 members of the North Coast Macintosh. So I think user groups live, oddly enough.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   In infamy.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.540]   Yeah, maybe. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an interesting week. Of course, last week
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.460]   we had a big announcement from Amazon. Next week we have a big announcement from Apple.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.780]   What should we start with, John?
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.300]   Amazon.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.740]   Amazon announced three new Kindles. The little basic Kindle, $79, which I bought and got
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.740]   immediately in love.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   It's available now.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.060]   Where is it? Do we have it?
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.380]   I didn't bring it. Do we have one? Did Tom leave his lying around?
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.140]   No, he's got his at home.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.780]   All they did is they chopped off the keyboard, which was always kind of vestigial anyway.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.580]   How often do you type on a Kindle? And they took the audio out. So it's 79 bucks, ad supported,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.380]   and it's just a great size. It's the same e-ink screen. It's very light. They announced
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.340]   a touch version of that so that you don't have to press buttons. I don't know really
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.540]   what the point of the touch is. And then they announced the Kindle Fire.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.540]   Actually, we do have it here.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540]   Do we?
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   Yeah. I think that's it.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.540]   Bring it forward.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.860]   Leo, did you say they took the audio out?
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.580]   Yeah, this was something that they didn't make a big deal about, but I was a little
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.100]   disappointed because I'm an Audible fan, right? And I used to listen to Audible on my Kindle
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.780]   all the time, and it's not here anymore.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.900]   Well, you can listen to Audible on one of your 18 phones. You can just do it on your
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.900]   car steering. You can just do it on your watch.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.780]   It's not the end of the world, I agree.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.660]   No, I just actually was laughing because we're supposed to be talking about e-readers tomorrow
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.500]   on Tekzilla because I was sitting there. I did something I promised myself I would never
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.140]   do, which is read another novel on the iPhone.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.140]   And that's tough.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.380]   I read it even faster than I would have otherwise because it was such a horrible experience,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.420]   glowing in the dark, my eyes falling off my face. And I actually think I'm going to turn
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.100]   around and buy another one of the Kindles.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.460]   It was the backlight you didn't like, not the size of the screen.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.260]   Well, the size of the screen is a tr... Well, it's Ready Player One, which is not a particularly
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.700]   long book. It's like the ultimate collection of '80s pop culture references wrapped in
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.740]   sci-fi. It's a really fun read, but it ends up breaking down to 685 pages, which is more
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.900]   like 1,685 paragraphs on the iPhone as you're blowing through and clicking every two seconds
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.920]   to try to get through to the next page.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.520]   They call it a genre buster, Ernest Cline.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.180]   It's more like a completely out of control set of game references and music references
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.860]   from the '80s. It's a lot of geek culture.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.060]   And I believe there are giant Japanese robots.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.060]   Yes.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   That's important.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.060]   Yes.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.380]   Immersive gaming. Tom and Veronica are going to be talking about this.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.500]   So yeah, I would not hesitate to recommend this one. This is the $79 one, which, I mean,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.340]   that price is very compelling. You can get a ton of books on it. I think it's eight gigabytes.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.940]   And it's easy to read because that E-ink screen, I think, is so... Have you ever had a Kindle?
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.300]   I've had... My wife has one. I've used several different...
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.260]   Sarah's a librarian, of course. She's a book fan.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.100]   I've used E-ink on three different platforms. Basically, if you want to read or you get
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.100]   E-ink...
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   I agree.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100]   If you want battery life, you get E-ink.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.580]   You agree, Dan? Are you...
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.100]   Without a doubt. I love my old Kindle. In fact, that audio is one of the selling points
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.700]   for me. I'm a huge Audible fan, but I also put a lot of podcasts on there, and that battery
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.380]   life is wonderful. But I think that the number one feature of this new Kindle is that $79
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.220]   price point. What this does is drive competitive price pressures downwards and makes... If
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:10.620]   you think about the power of putting the world's best literature into the hands of every person...
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.300]   It's a tough sell at $200. Your mom might get it, but your buddy from college might
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:22.060]   not. At $79, that's an almost undeniable device. And then you can put the world's best literature
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.500]   in anyone's hands.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.620]   It's almost an impulse purchase at that price. I'm going on vacation in a couple of weeks.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.540]   I have on this Kindle, Infinite Jest, the new Neil Stevenson Reamde.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.940]   Also a good read. I read that last week.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.260]   Yeah, I can't wait to read that. And what else is on there?
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.500]   Complete Works of William Shakespeare. I see you're aiming high. You're not a gadget.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.220]   Did you just buy a book on there?
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.980]   I just bought a library for you.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.340]   John bought a book on there.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.260]   It was a way for 500 bucks. I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.860]   He bought Jaron Lanier's new book, which I have in hardcover, but thank you anyway. I'm
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860]   glad to have it now.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.860]   Actually, that's Tom's, isn't it?
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:02.660]   Oh, it's not mine. Oh, good. So that's not mine. So I have Infinite Jest, Reamde.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.980]   Yours is at home, if you recall.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:10.220]   That's right. Now I feel better. Now I feel better. But I mean, that's thousands and thousands
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.300]   of pages. Oh, I know what else I have on there. Steve Gibson's been begging me to read these
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.780]   Honor Harrington books. You ever read On Basilisk Station? It sounds trashy, but anyway, that's
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.780]   on there.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.780]   Sounds trashy.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.340]   It sounds pretty trashy sci-fi. But that will, that is going to get me a month's worth of
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.260]   reading and it weighs nothing.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.260]   No.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.460]   And four gigs, by the way, not eight gigs. Thank you.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.540]   It's fast. I'm actually really impressed at how fast this reads.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.980]   The page turns much better than the original Kindle. So that's the low end and then there's
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.460]   the touch version. But of course, all the press attention goes to the Fire, which is
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:50.220]   a $200 color tablet running Android, highly customized Android with a cover flow style
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.820]   interface. You get a month of Amazon Prime with that, which is brilliant. The analysts
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.500]   are saying that Amazon is at best breaking even, probably losing a little bit of money.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.420]   Supposedly makes $209 in parts.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.020]   According to iSupply. Yeah. And iSupply is usually pretty good. I mean, it's hard for
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   them to know exactly what it's worth.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.860]   But that, you know, it drops in time anyway.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.980]   Why does anybody care if they're losing money? Because we don't even think twice. Consoles,
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.060]   you're paying like half the price of a console. Phones are subsidized. Amazon obviously really,
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.580]   I think Amazon sees an opportunity because the entire non-iOS tablet market is functionally
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   non-existent.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.980]   Well, and what it underscores, I think, is the fact that Amazon, this is a portal to
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.500]   Amazon's money making machine. It's a store portal. So that's really what's going on here.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.620]   Of course they lose money. Who cares? They could give it away because they're going to
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.460]   make so much money on the thing. Magazines, they've got almost every magazine publisher
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.620]   involved in this.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.980]   And interestingly enough, many of the magazines will be customized for the fire with audio
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.380]   video. They'll be interactive. So there'll be, it won't be totally different. Well, I
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.500]   don't know. You know, it's now, by the way, if you, if you're looking at the video right
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.220]   now, you look, it does look a little bit like the BlackBerry playbook.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.220]   It is the BlackBerry playbook.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.220]   It is the BlackBerry playbook. Same manufacturer.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.580]   It's the BlackBerry playbook for a lot less money with a much better backend in terms
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.020]   of services. What I'm curious about is, is whether or not you'll be able to load any
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.620]   software you want to on it, which is something nobody's really been able to answer.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.660]   I'm sure they'll hack soon, but I mean, right now you have to put the Android apps that
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.940]   are available in Amazon's Android store. You're right. They may have a special store that
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.620]   is fire only. Tablets traditionally haven't done very well on Android. In fact, I have,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.340]   you know, a couple of Android tablets and it's really a disappointing experience because
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.820]   there's so few tablet apps for it. This one is seven inches, which is, I think, a good
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:50.380]   size. It's a little bigger than this, but smaller than the iPad. Pocketable, purseable.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.340]   I don't know if that's pocketable.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:58.620]   This is pocketable. Where is it? Where is it?
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.620]   It's right there.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.380]   It's in my pocket. Talk about, not only is it in my pocket, I can put it in the pocket
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.300]   with my phone. Now it's doubly pocketable.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   Let's see it.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   That's kind of a big pocket, Leo.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   I can't get it out.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   Yeah, you got an oversized pocket.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.340]   It's a captive kangaroo pocket. No, let's put it in that pocket.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.340]   No, it won't fit.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.340]   You didn't try very hard.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:22.940]   I did. I tried real hard. Look, you must have quit.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.540]   Anyway, it is relatively pocketable. I was actually talking about the Fire, which is
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.060]   bigger than that. I don't think it's pocketable, but seven inches is a nice size. Dan, which
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.900]   would you buy if it were your money?
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.340]   If it were my money, well, look, I'm a reader and I enjoy the E Ink screen. I mean, that's
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.020]   far more important to me. Like Patrick said, reading on the iPhone, not only choose your
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.820]   battery up, but choose your eyes up. At the same time, this is important because it's
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:56.340]   the actualization of the ecosystem, right? So what every other company has failed to
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:02.220]   do, Google, Blackberry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Amazon has really
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.860]   wrapped the ecosystem into the device itself from the opposite direction as Apple.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.820]   And what that does for me is not so much about the device or the ecosystem itself, but it
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.960]   communicates trust. I can trust that Amazon has thought this through. And as a consumer,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.580]   if I'm going to plunk down cash, I don't want to plunk down cash on a platform that's going
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740]   to go away in two months or two years.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.380]   I know that Bezos has thought this through. He's playing the long game. He must be a go
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:34.260]   player. You know, he plays the long game. And I know that if I spend money, I can trust
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.820]   that it'll stay in that cloud.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.980]   So you're saying, Dan, you did not buy an HP touchpad.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:44.780]   I bought 18 of them. I mean, that's important too, because it helps me. I actually bought
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.700]   three of them and I gave them to friends. And it really helps with buy-in.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.140]   A hundred bucks, you mean? At $99, it helps with buy-in.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.140]   Yeah, yeah, at $99. But, you know, I have a lot of friends who are PhD students and
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.620]   cynics and they're not entirely bought in on the need for more gadgets in their lives.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.980]   This changed their minds.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:12.580]   So get this. According to VentureBeat, Devendra Hardawar writing in MobileBeat says that Amazon
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:21.180]   is in serious negotiations to buy Palm, not even just webOS, but Palm from HP.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.860]   How many sources are on that?
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.140]   A well-placed source.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.140]   Which means what?
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.140]   A well-placed source.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.020]   Yeah. It seems a little far-fetched.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.260]   It's an awesome rumor. It'd be cool.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.220]   Boy, you know, why would they bother? It sounds like they've done a good job making Android
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.220]   accessible.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.380]   Yeah, I mean, yeah. Why?
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.220]   Plus Amazon has an Android app store.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:50.620]   Again, I don't understand what, I can't find one single, yeah. Tell me one advantage Amazon
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.740]   gets out of purchasing Palms. I mean, basically IP at this point, which has not been a spectacular
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.340]   success for HP.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:05.740]   Well according to Dealbook, it's all about the patents, baby. Amazon might be more interested
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:14.060]   in the Palm patents to protect Fire. Remember, Microsoft and others have been on an Android
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.940]   lawsuit tear. And of course, they stay away from Google because they got the deep pockets.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:26.980]   But I could see people suing Apple or Microsoft suing Amazon over the Kindle. Can't you see
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.980]   Apple going after?
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   Apple for sure.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.980]   Yes.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.980]   They sue everybody.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.580]   And so if you had these patents in hand, maybe it'd be worth it. HP bought Palm for $1.2
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.780]   billion. I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.020]   Yeah, I mean, maybe we don't know the price. Maybe it's like 18 bucks and a pack of smokes,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.020]   you know?
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.860]   But HP bought Palm for $1.2 billion last year.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:16:00.700]   I would tend to think that if Palm is sitting on a lot of really lucrative, defensive patents,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.060]   then Google or somebody else would be bidding large amounts of cash for them.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.780]   And they may be. We don't know. What we don't know is what we don't know. To coin a phrase
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.860]   that Donald Rumsfeld came up with first. Well, there's what we know, there's what we know,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.980]   we don't know, and the know that we don't know that we could know, but we don't know.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   If you know what I mean.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   It's gotten to this.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.260]   I knew I shouldn't have had a cup of coffee before the show. How is your coffee, by the
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.260]   way, John?
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   Bitter.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   Yeah. Just like you.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.260]   Exactly.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.780]   Yeah. We try to give everybody the coffee they deserve.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.060]   I like the reflection.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.540]   Mine's weak. And of course, Patrick's is strong and black.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.740]   No. Patrick's is gone.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.700]   Wow. You went right through that.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.340]   I'm not an amateur.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.340]   Do we care about Amazon and California sales tax or should we push straight on to the iPhone
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.340]   boomer bond rate?
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:56.260]   What happened there, because they were able to broker a compromise with Governor Brown.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.540]   So just to give you the back story, and then maybe you can give us an update once we get
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.860]   the back story, but Amazon, as you know, does not collect sales tax, if it can help it.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:11.140]   State of California passed a law, I think earlier this year, saying, no, you got to
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.220]   because you do business in this state, at which Amazon responded, okay, fine, we don't
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:20.100]   do business in the state, and cut off all of the Amazon associates fees for people like
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.700]   me. I mean, that's $30,000 a year out the door. By the way, $30,000, which I paid a
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.820]   California state income tax on.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.460]   They like to double tax in this state.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:36.940]   Well, they lost that tax and basically it was a showdown between the state of California
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:42.540]   and Amazon. Now, I think California didn't blink exactly, but they gave them some time.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.100]   Yeah, basically the LA Times summary of it is pretty good. The company, Amazon, would
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.700]   drop its battle to overturn the state's new law that required it and many other out-of-state
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.260]   online retailers to collect taxes.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.900]   Overstock.com, another company that said, we're not doing business in California then.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.420]   Well, it's kind of funny because they didn't say they weren't doing business in California,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.920]   because California is more than 10% of the population of the United States. Nobody wants
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.780]   to stop selling to California. Nobody wants to cut sales tax.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:14.620]   Well, they can sell to them. By the way, California does attempt to collect. The issue is not
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.020]   whether you're supposed to pay sales tax. You are.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.340]   California's on the, like many other states, is on the honor system for paying sales tax
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.900]   for online or out-of-state purchases.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:30.860]   Is it the honor system? Because it said on my California 540R return, did you buy anything
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.460]   and not pay sales tax for it? They call it use tax. And they said, how much? We paid
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.580]   $6,000 in use tax last year.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.580]   For what?
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.140]   Stuff I bought on Amazon. Because everybody else collects sales tax, but Amazon does not.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.460]   So we actually did that. We paid that tax. So California lost not only the income tax
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.300]   I paid on my associates fee, but they didn't lose the use tax, but you got to think that
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.020]   I'm going to be less likely to pay it, particularly if Amazon starts collecting. But anyway, Amazon
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.860]   is not collecting it. It doesn't have to for a couple of years now.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.460]   Yeah. 2012, 2013. I mean, what's kind of interesting about looking at this is, you
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.180]   can kind of have the Cory Doctorow moment and be like, this is exactly like what happened
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.620]   when Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs began destroying the markets in downtown America.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:21.940]   And it's like, that battle, it's kind of ironic because literally the local retailers are
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.620]   crying foul. We can't compete. This is terrible.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.200]   On the flip side, the only reason this came, the only reason this passed even the California
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.400]   State Assembly is because they want more revenue. And this seemed like an easy way to pay it.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:40.860]   By the way, devil to use saying, and I think this is true, that after this broker deal,
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.260]   Amazon has said, we're going to build two distribution centers in California. So they're
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.380]   going to hire people, they're going to put money into the California economy. So a good
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.680]   deal for California because the sales tax will be collected in a couple of years. I'm
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.180]   not sure why Amazon made this deal, to be honest.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.900]   Yeah. Well, they just opened up shop in Nevada where everybody else is and just leave it
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   at that.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.900]   Ship it over the state line.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   It's not that far.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.360]   Partially because they're running out of employable people in Reno and in Vegas.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.960]   There's a high unemployment rate in that state. It's one of the collapsed economies.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.760]   Sometimes there's a high unemployment rate because people just don't work well.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.720]   There's plenty of people to hire in Nevada.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Okay.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   Where would you?
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.480]   I know I got friends who run kitchens in Nevada. They would love to find more people that were
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.760]   worth employing. Sorry. I mean, the other thing is like everything I've read about Amazon's
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.080]   fulfillment centers, there's a couple of really good articles about this.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.140]   There's only two people that work there. It's all done with robots.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.140]   It's not all done with robots.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   Giant Japanese robots.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.540]   And they're almost entirely done with temps.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.220]   Oh, you're kidding. So they don't have to pay any benefits.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.940]   So they bring in people. They have incredibly high standards for the performance in the
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.540]   fulfillment centers. And if people can't live up to that or they get injured or whatever,
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.300]   they are temps, they fall off and they have more people willing to step in. So there's
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.260]   some pretty kind of classic taking advantage of the labor pool in that situation too.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.260]   The other thing-
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.260]   Go ahead.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.620]   The economy is not to be undersold here. I mean, this is the worst economy since Jesus
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.180]   was a sophomore and this is the right time for Amazon to have this fight because they
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.180]   have-
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.180]   When was he a sophomore and what school are we talking about?
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.180]   1987.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.180]   That's a good line.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:19.340]   I'm just saying, you know, it's, this is a very, Amazon has leveraged to push this fight
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:25.340]   now, right? This is no, I mean, our federal government aside, California needs money.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.900]   Amazon can hold this over them. This is a very good time to push this type of fight.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:37.460]   So who loses business to the fire? Does Apple, does Barnes and Noble or both?
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   We won't-
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.060]   I say market grows. Everyone wins.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.060]   You agree, John?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.820]   No, I think the market's flat already.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.620]   I think there you could make, there's some case that maybe the iPad is not as strong
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.420]   as it was. There were some stories that-
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.220]   I think people are in, they got, there's guys like you, they've got two or three of them.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.340]   And then a Kindle, probably two or three. You probably have five Kindles.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.300]   I do. I have every Kindle. And in fact, I have several of-
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.300]   You think he's joking?
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.820]   No, no, I do. Because I keep buying them for family members thinking they'll want one.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.980]   People should want one. Kindle's quite a nice product. Anyway, I think the market's flat
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.700]   and it is an iPad market. What person in their right mind would buy anything but an iPad?
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.460]   Well, I think because it's 200 bucks. So I think you're right.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460]   I don't think it's going to-
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.460]   It's like that HP thing then, 95 bucks, you got a piece of-
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.580]   A lot of people bought that 99, a million people bought a touchpad. I think frankly
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.900]   that it won't take a big chunk, but I think you could 20, 30% of the iPad market could
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.500]   conceivably buy a Kindle and be happy.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   And you know what the funny thing is-
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   Angry birds, books, movies, tea.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.380]   I'll bet you half of those people already have an iPad and they just buy one out of
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.900]   curiosity. They'll be like you, they're kind of like pack rats.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.900]   Or it's maybe-
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.700]   I totally disagree, John. I think that this is an entirely different market that's going
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.340]   to be buying this. These people may be aspirational towards the iPad. Like they may want to buy
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:58.220]   an iPad, but $500 is a big expense right now. $200 is a much easier expense. It lets you
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.340]   get into that marketplace. It lets you be that type of consumer at a significantly reduced
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   rate and it lets you have a multiple, it is a Kindle at the same time it's a tablet. It's
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.620]   not a high end tablet, but what this does is redefine the marketplace.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:19.940]   And also, I was going to say, I'm with you because you're looking at like Amazon Prime
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.220]   last week. They set up a deal. Everybody with an Amazon Prime account now has access to
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:29.140]   11,000 Fox titles. All the movies, all the television shows, basically as part of the
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.900]   Amazon Prime subscription. I think there's a huge number of Amazon customers that will
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.740]   opt into this because it is an extension of the existing products they already have.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:42.460]   And Prime is so brilliant because you pay for Prime. They give you free movies, but
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.500]   really what they do is they give you the right to buy more stuff from Amazon. I mean, I go
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.420]   to Amazon first just because I'm a Prime member.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.660]   And this may even help them make the bigger deals down the line. I mean, Fox is wonderful
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.900]   now and think of the deals that if they're able to go to when they're in their biz dev
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   meetings, you know, the guys with blazers and jeans and they're going to their biz dev
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.100]   meetings. This helps them.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.180]   They're probably listening to Mumford and Sons while they're going, right?
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.020]   Well, probably. Yeah.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.780]   But it helps them. It helps them make bigger deals down the line. It helps them say our
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.100]   audience isn't just this potential audience of people who maybe have an Xbox or a Roku
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.740]   and hook it up to their TV. This lets them say these people are streaming right now on
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.380]   this device. This audience is much larger than it previously was. It's not a speculative
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.460]   audience. It's a real audience.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:40.060]   Who was it that said that Amazon, Apple, Google and not Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Google,
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.700]   the four horsemen of the apocalypse. One of the one of the VC guys said that.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.740]   I think that you're seeing Amazon really come on strong here.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.060]   I'm not buying any of this argument until I see some numbers that confirm it.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   Well, we won't know for a while.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.540]   And I think also Samsung isn't going to take this lying down.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.780]   Yeah, but Samsung, the Samsung's competing in a completely different way than Amazon
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.500]   has a huge existing market.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.620]   No, I understand that they have a channel.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   iTunes has built one.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.620]   They have a channel.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.060]   You know who I'm really worried about?
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.020]   The Dunder Mifflin tablet.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:15.500]   We are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet, the Pyramid.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.900]   Why is it shaped like that?
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.820]   So you can tell your clients unleash the power of the Pyramid.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.380]   It's huge. How much does it weigh?
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.340]   Oh, no, no, no. Without the battery pack and the optional memory booster, it's barely three
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   pounds.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.340]   How much memory does it have without the booster?
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.340]   50 L.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.340]   I'm sorry, L?
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.500]   How many L to a K?
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.300]   You're really going to want the booster.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.980]   I'll take five.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.500]   I play that just so that we will be pulled off YouTube again this week.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.900]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Unleash the Power of the Pyramid.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.940]   I think we used that gag on this show like months ago.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   Did we?
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   The Pyramid joke, yeah.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.740]   Wow. Do you think the writers of The Office watch?
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.180]   They probably wrote it before we did because it takes forever to produce those shows.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.100]   Maybe this will help. The Office, Thursday nights on NBC.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.180]   It won't. It won't help.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.260]   It won't. You know why it won't help? Because NBC doesn't care.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:12.300]   That's why, ladies and gentlemen, they have an automated tool on YouTube that just pulls
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   it. They don't care if it's a plug.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.220]   Have you been watching some of these new sitcoms they've been rolling out?
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.220]   No. What?
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   Oh, Whitney.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.460]   Whitney? What is that about? Whitney Houston?
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.020]   No, you've got to watch some of these shows. It's just like this.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.020]   It's horrible.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.020]   Really? What is it?
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.020]   It's horrible with the canned laugh track.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.900]   Canned laugh track. It's just a... But you can tell that there may have been a seed of
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.860]   hope that the suits got a hold of this and they said, "No, no, we've got to fix it."
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.500]   What about that one with the Terra Nova, the dinosaurs? Is that any good?
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.740]   It hasn't been out yet, has it?
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.740]   No. It hasn't rolled yet.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   You know what's tonight?
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.340]   People either really like it or hate it.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.340]   Season premiere of?
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.340]   Dexter.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.740]   Thank you. Dexter. Are you excited?
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.980]   You know, I only watch Dexter now and again.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.980]   Three words.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.980]   It's kind of sick.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   Yeah, it is sick.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.980]   In a good way.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   No.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   Edward James Olmos. You know who's not like NBC? ABC. Dan Patterson. With ABC News Radio
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.940]   dot com. Great to have you on. Patrick Norton's here from Tekzilla. And it's John C. Dvorak.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.140]   What's your favorite TV show on the new season, John C. Dvorak?
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.140]   On the new season?
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.140]   Yes.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.140]   The new J.J. Abrams show.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.140]   Ooh. There's a J.J. Abrams show.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.620]   Yeah. It's on the third one already. You missed it.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620]   What is that?
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.620]   What's that? Persons of Interest? Is that the name of the new one?
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   Persons of Interest. Yeah.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.620]   Ooh. That sounds interesting.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:28.300]   It's about a world that... It's actually about John Poindexter's old idea turned into a TV
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   show.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.460]   Oh, I've got to watch it. Persons of Interest, huh?
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.460]   I've got to watch it.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.460]   I've missed the first three. I'll just watch it when it comes out on Roku.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.340]   The third one's coming out. You missed the first two. I'll make you a disc.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.980]   I like to wait. No, no. I like to wait. Because then I can skip the commercials. I can just...
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.740]   And I can watch like 18 episodes in a row.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.540]   Actually, it looks like you can watch the full thing on the CBS web page.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.540]   On the CBS web page.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.660]   Yeah. You can watch it on one of those little devices that you guys are so fond of.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.860]   Actually, I'm just going to watch it right now, John.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.620]   You know why I'm fond of little devices? Never mind. Let's talk about GoToAssist before I
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.500]   get in any more trouble. Then we'll come back with our great panel to talk more about the
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.300]   tech news. And of course, Apple's got something coming up. I don't know what it's all about.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:11.580]   But first, GoToAssist Express. I haven't talked about this in a while. Do you remember, Patrick,
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:20.180]   when we used to use... What was it called? Expert... Oh, what was it called? It was a
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.220]   tool that was basically was the predecessor to GoToAssist.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.820]   It's GoToAssist, except for modems and pain.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.260]   Well, that's the problem. Times have changed. Everybody's on the internet now. And GoToAssist
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.940]   Express is so amazing. This is the way you can support your customers faster, easier.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.940]   Puts you in a position to do what you do best, which is access the system, diagnose the problem,
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.820]   and resolve the problem. And most of the time, it's instant almost. It's so much faster than
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:55.220]   that phone call. Click Start. Okay. Look for the accessory. Okay. You just fix it yourself.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.980]   Customers love you. And you get on with your work. You'll be getting more done faster,
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.060]   easier. You can fix the problem without being there in person, of course. In fact, they
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.220]   don't even have to be there in person because they have unattended support. Eight sessions
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.700]   at the same time. So that means you can run a scan on one, run a fix on another one, do
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.040]   an update on a third, and keep going. You don't wait around. I know it's going to cut
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.260]   into your halo time, but you can still have some fun later after you solve all the problems.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:27.980]   I want you to try it free for 30 days. Visit gotoassist.com/twit. Actually, no. No, no.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.700]   I'm wrong. Go to assist.com and then click the Try It Free button, right? Then enter
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.740]   the offer come twit. I'm not sure. It says two different things in here. Let me just
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:43.740]   see what happens if I go to gotoassist.com/twit. Citrix recently changed it so that they want
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.220]   you to click the Try It Free and use the offer code. Either way. I mean, we get credit if
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:55.460]   you just buy the damn thing. Gotoassist.com/twit. Yes, sign up for a free 30-day trial. If
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.780]   they ever do ask you for an offer code, use twit. But I think if you go to assist.com/twit,
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:06.780]   it works. We love Citrix. They love us. It's a match made in heaven. Free 24/7 customer
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.500]   service for you, the IT professional. 128-bit end-to-end encryption so you never have to
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   worry about security. It just really is a good solution. Gotoassist.com. Expert City.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.860]   Oh wow. You remember that? Vaguely. They bought Expert City and that's what this came out
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:29.660]   of. Anyway. Homeland. That's the show that's coming up tonight. Homeland. Yeah. Now what's
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.940]   that about? I don't know. Somebody ought to remember. It's kind of like a... See, Eileen
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.820]   is like the expert on it. It's a meme show filled with a bunch of... All I know is Claire
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.340]   Danes is in it. Oh, I love her. Claire Danes is in it. I think I love her. It's a spy...
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.700]   I love her name. Claire Danes. What does she look like? You've seen her a million times.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:54.100]   She's been an actress forever. Oh yeah. Claire Danes. I don't know who she is. Claire Catherine
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:00.780]   Danes. Born April 12th, 1979. You used to quote Degrassi junior high. Oh, she was in
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:07.380]   Degrassi. No, I never watched Degrassi. She was in My So-Called Life. She was in Baz Luhrmann's
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.620]   Romeo Plus Juliet, the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe you said that. What
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.540]   was it? I love Baz Luhrmann, but this is good. Now we're really off topic.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:22.220]   And she played Temple Brandon. Oh, I did mention Homeland. All right. Well, she's in it. Okay.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.420]   Let's get back to the Apple. Did you know her... Oh yeah, Apple. Apple. Apple. Are we
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.860]   done with Kindle Fire? Is there... Oh, no, we're not. You know why? Because I didn't
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:34.220]   mention Silk. The thing... I think the stealth announcement in here is that Amazon's got
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.260]   its own browser, which initially will be on the Kindle, but I wouldn't be surprised to
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:44.620]   see it on other platforms. Amazon will be caching, pre-caching pages on its own servers,
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:51.100]   on its EC2 servers. So it's using its very powerful cloud system. By the way, many of
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.620]   the sites you visit and many of the assets for sites you visit come from Amazon's S3
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.660]   and EC2. Yeah. So they're going to have a very fast browser. I think there's going to
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.340]   be some browser wars coming up. The Chrome is moving up. Did you notice this? The numbers
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.140]   came out. Chrome is like inching in on everybody. You know what happened? I think people, geeks
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.220]   like us use Firefox for a long time. The last Firefox had a memory leak or something. I
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.620]   mean, it would just take over your system. Yeah, it's been interesting. It was awful.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.500]   It's also been interesting watching Firefox kind of turn into the Java of browsers. It
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.780]   is. It's fattened. Careful, because there's a lot of people that are Java fans here. Java
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:32.260]   1 is this year. It's okay. As long as they don't have burning spears or anything. Java
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:37.300]   works. It's great. I don't need a delete exploitative Java update every five minutes on my computer.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.940]   They may not have burning spears, John, but they've got a JIT compiler that'll just kick
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   your butt. Are we at all concerned about security? Yes, we are. This is the problem. I think
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.860]   that a lot of people complain about this. Instead of releasing technical information
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:57.380]   about the Kindle, they released basically marketing information that makes it very unclear
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.940]   what they're doing. For instance, SSL. They're doing something similar to the Opera mini
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.180]   browser, which is they're compressing and shrinking pages on their way to you. The only
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.580]   way you could do that is by breaking SSL, by doing in effect a man in the middle so
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.460]   that you'll have a certificate to fire or to Silk, and then Silk will have its own certificate
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:22.460]   to your bank. It's not clear if they're doing that or not. The FAQ is very fuzzy about that.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:28.460]   I think that's what creeped me out is that they weren't clear about the documentation
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.320]   when that was announced. It's the first thing I check is the technical stuff. Developers
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.060]   ask legitimately a lot of questions about, "Well, is it support HTML5 standards? What
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   is going to happen there?" Amazon has been very, very unclear on that. Then, of course,
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.580]   there's people concerned about privacy because Amazon will be in between you and all your
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.580]   web transactions.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.900]   >> We don't even know at this point if you can turn off.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   >> They say that there's a way to turn off the cached browsing. We, again, we have to
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   see what that means and how it does it. CLT in our chat room is saying that Omalek did
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:11.900]   get a statement about this for GigaOM. I'm going to have to see what he said there.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.140]   >> There's a link.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.220]   >> Is there a link?
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.220]   >> Somebody just...
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.660]   >> I'm in the wrong room.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:23.660]   >> I'm always in the second room where there are real people, where the cool people are.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.460]   >> Let me quickly check because this is where...
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:32.380]   >> Here it is. Amazon Silk or a spider web, updated, blah, blah, blah. Everyone later
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:39.380]   reading this post by Chris Espinoza. It doesn't sound good. I'm just summarizing.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.380]   >> Bad.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   >> Bad.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   >> September 29th, 9.20am, a spokesperson for Amazon just pinged Omalek back. Is Amazon
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.900]   able to peer into its customer usage behavior and use that to offer services based on that
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.860]   data? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The answer is no. As you can see
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.340]   in our terms and condition, URLs are used to troubleshoot and diagnose Amazon Silk technical
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.860]   issues. Moreover, you can choose to operate Amazon Silk in basic or off-cloud mode. Off-cloud
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:16.500]   mode allows web pages generally to go directly to your computer rather than pass through
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.780]   our servers. As a reminder, usage data is collected anonymously and stored in aggregate
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.900]   and no personal identifiable information is stored. It's also possible to completely turn
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.580]   off the split browsing mode and use Amazon Silk like a conventional web browser.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.620]   >> But this is, again, it strikes me as more weasel words. They're saying, well, you can
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.100]   turn it off. What they're not telling us is, well, what happens if you don't turn it off?
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.660]   And, of course, 99% of Silk --
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.300]   >> They grow to, what, three-quarter of a billion customers like Facebook?
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.140]   >> Well, exactly. I mean, most --
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.300]   >> Because obviously people are concerned about privacy. Look at how privacy issues
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.780]   just hammered Facebook.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.300]   >> You could tell.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.980]   >> Yeah, they're out of business.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.140]   >> So I'm curious. It sounds to me like Amazon is still not being completely forthright.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.260]   And what they haven't answered also is this SSL issue. And I'd like to know. And I don't
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.660]   understand why they're hiding it. As you say, Dan, that makes me suspicious.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:09.380]   >> Yeah, again, it goes back to trust, right? Where I do trust them with the ecosystem and
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:15.060]   I trust them as a consumer, as a geek, if you're not forthright -- I mean, what is there
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.940]   to not be transparent about? I mean, how difficult --
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.940]   >> I don't trust any of these.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.900]   >> It may not be done. I think probably --
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.140]   >> I've actually gone to Scroogle.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   >> What's that?
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.140]   >> Scroogle.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.140]   >> Ah-ha. That's to Scroogle?
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.580]   >> Yeah, just look it up. Scroogle.org. S-C-R-O-G.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.220]   >> Does it wipe your search results?
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.500]   >> No, it's a middleman between you and Google. And it takes the cookies and says, "Yeah, yeah,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.260]   I'll take the cookies." And then it throws them all out.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.980]   >> Ah, so it's kind of a proxy Google.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   >> It's a --
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980]   >> And it sure is attractive, John.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.020]   >> Yeah, I know, isn't it? You actually don't use that.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.020]   >> Holy cow.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.220]   >> You go to find a IE plug-in and then it pops it in on your little --
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.500]   >> I have to use IE?
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   >> No, I'm sorry.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   >> Oh, it does Firefox, Opera, Chrome, too.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   >> That's what I meant.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   >> No, that was on IE6.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.040]   >> I haven't used IE for years. But anyway, so it turns it into a list. It turns it into
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.680]   your little list thing. You just type in there and then it throws up the results.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.480]   >> Well, I'm going to put a link to Scroogle in my Google Docs and make sure that I email
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.440]   it to everybody on Gmail so that all my friends can protect themselves from the Google search
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   engine.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440]   >> Just saying.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.160]   >> The last thing -- Google gets so much information from me in so many other ways, like my Android
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   phone.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   >> Use Scroogle.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:25.080]   >> Use Scroogle on my Android phone. Speaking of which, I like this phone. This is the Galaxy
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.120]   S2, the Sprint version. Did you hear what happened, though, with the AT&T version? So
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.760]   I use a lock on my screen so that when John gets my phone, he can't, you know, look into
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.320]   it. One of these pattern locks. But, John, if you have the AT&T version and you've got
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.800]   this lock turned on, all you have to do is let it do what it just did, go back to sleep,
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.000]   and then when you press the button again, it's wide open.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   >> All right.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.360]   >> Not a problem on other Galaxy. You don't have that on your international Galaxy.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.320]   >> I'm surprised they still use that pattern thing. Let's see.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.920]   >> That's a feature, not a bug.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.960]   >> You know, John has this theory that he can tell from the finger smudges what my pattern
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   is.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   >> Probably.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   >> Let me make sure it's not --
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   >> Oh, actually --
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.960]   >> Yeah, it's pretty obvious.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   >> It's pretty straightforward.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.240]   >> So here's the deal. If you're using a phone like that, make sure you wipe it. The new
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.560]   -- now let's talk about iOS. Apparently iOS will have some new locking features, including,
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.480]   I'm told, a pattern unlock.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   >> Okay.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.120]   >> In fact, they basically stole every Android feature they could find.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   >> Why not?
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.320]   >> That's the Apple way, first of all. Second of all, I want to give a shout-out, actually,
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.520]   to Tasha Sagan over at PCMag, who's been railing against iPhone rumor-mongering all summer
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.280]   long. He just got to the point where he was so fed up with iPhone 5 titles showing up
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.680]   with complete bogus BS following them up, showing up like the top of a tech meme.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.160]   >> That's how you get your numbers up.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   >> Well, or you can do interesting articles.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   >> Nah.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   >> Okay.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   >> Why bother?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:54.280]   >> But I have to say, we are one day 18 hours and 18 minutes away from Apple's iPhone event.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   >> So now it's --
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   >> Ooh.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   >> Will there -- will there -- yeah, it's like --
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   >> Stop the presses.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.880]   >> It's like, will there be the inexpensive Brazilian iPhone? Like, is there going to
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   be a low-cost iPhone produced in Brazil?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.400]   >> Well, I think the only thing worth checking out is going to be whether -- you know, Cook
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.840]   is going to be the new Steve. He's going to go on stage and --
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.960]   >> That's going to be interesting.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.520]   >> And if you didn't notice it, when these little guys here came out, Bezos was pretending
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.840]   to be Steve Jobs, and he's out there waving his arms.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.080]   >> He did the best Steve Jobs I've seen in a long time.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   >> You think so?
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   >> He did a very good job, I thought.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   >> He looks --
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   >> You know, it's interesting. At Zuckerberg's --
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.120]   >> He's not with that shirt. He needs a black --
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   >> He needs a turtleneck.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   >> Turtleneck.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   >> I know.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   >> He had, like, a white shirt.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.960]   >> Zuckerberg at the F8 announcements, I think, also was channeling Steve Jobs. It's very
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:38.240]   clear how Steve has heavily influenced the community as to how you give a presentation.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.600]   >> The trouble is, they're not Steve Jobs.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.160]   >> It would be a huge mistake for Tim Cook, who is emphatically not Steve Jobs, for him
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.480]   to do anything but be Tim Cook, because he's not exactly Mr. Charisma. I mean, he's not.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.480]   And just be Tim Cook. That's my advice to you.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.840]   >> Did Steve come out at all? You know, is that -- as long as we're going to speculate,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.440]   is that something we expect to see?
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.320]   >> I doubt it. What do you think?
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   >> Expect to see what?
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   >> Steve.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.240]   >> Oh, no, we're not going to see Steve.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.800]   >> I agree.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.580]   >> I would like to see Steve. It would encourage me that he's doing better than what we think
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:16.800]   he might be doing. This is the breakdown of the current rumors that John and Patrick and
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.360]   Dan do not want to hear.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   >> Here we go.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   >> Number one.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.840]   >> We don't want to hear this. We just don't want to want to hear this, right?
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.280]   >> You want it, don't you? You really want it.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.640]   >> What's interesting is how it's moving around. So there will be two iPhones, there won't
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.520]   be two iPhones, there will be two iPhones. The latest is there will be a cheap iPhone,
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.080]   the N90A. We now have a model number that will be basically an 8 gigabyte iPhone 4.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.020]   There will be the 4S, which is barely new.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.020]   >> Where's the pen?
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   >> That's the N94 model.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   >> Okay.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.920]   >> It will have a 3.5-inch screen, not bigger. It will have CDMA and GSM in one phone so
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.940]   they can sell it to all three carriers. We're pretty sure Sprint will have it. We know T-Mobile
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.300]   won't. They said they won't.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:05.160]   HSPA Plus. Now, this is the thing that I was told by an inside source at AT&T. They recently
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:12.320]   received a shipment of micro SIMs for 4G on AT&T, and there is only one phone currently
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.040]   on AT&T that has micro SIMs.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   >> Oh, my goodness.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.840]   >> So I think maybe, we were thinking there would be no 4G.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   >> That's what I was thinking.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.640]   >> But I think maybe there will be. Are you mocking me?
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   >> No, I'm just agreeing.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.160]   >> You're mocking me, aren't you?
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   >> No.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.520]   >> I think they got to, if it's only Tim Cook, he's got to do something badass. They can't
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.200]   give him a marginal product and have him go out and go, "Hi, I'm not Steve Jobs and I'd
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.600]   like to show you something that is not as cool as what Steve would bring."
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.480]   >> I'm very excited to say we have the A5 processor.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.280]   >> We have the down market device. I'm a down market CEO. Here's the down market device.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   They can't do that.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280]   >> Why don't we start the...
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.360]   >> This is going to sell so well in Brazil because it's so cheap.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.520]   >> Why don't we start the rumor right now that we will see the first Apple HDTV on Tuesday?
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.640]   Quick tweet, let's do it.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   >> Well, but is it true?
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   >> Three to one odds.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   >> Against or for?
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   >> For.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   >> Really?
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   >> For what?
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   >> I think so.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   >> I'll take that bet.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   >> What did he say?
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   >> He says we're going to have an Apple TV, television set.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   >> On this announcement?
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   >> HDTV.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   >> I mean, I think they should do. I agree 100% that this is a great idea for a product,
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   but I also would take the bet because they're not doing it.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   >> They're nuts. They're nuts. There's no way.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   >> I'll tell you what.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   >> I think that's a good idea.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   >> I will fly to Sonoma County and John, I'll buy you, your choice, a bottle of wine under
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   100 bucks.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   >> Don't do that. Beer.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   >> Okay, but what if I...
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   >> Dinner.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   >> Don't buy him a bottle of wine.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   >> Keep it affordable, but...
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   >> You can buy condos in New York for his wine list.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   >> He can, A, he works for ABC, he can afford a case of good wine.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   >> He works for ABC Radio. He can barely afford a Volkswagen.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   >> ABC Radio's the big dough.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   >> I gotta go to the bathroom.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   >> I'm gonna get...
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   >> But now, the huge question is, is this a good idea?
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   >> I think it's a good idea.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   >> But now, here's the key on this new iPhone.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   >> Right.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   >> Take a bite...
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   >> Wait, wait, wait, the 4, the 4S, or the 5?
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   >> We're continuing on this road to oblivion.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   >> What would you like to talk about?
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   >> No, I think this is good. I want to know the whole thing.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   Because, I mean, God knows there's nothing more important in the world than yet another iPhone.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   >> How would you like a phone that you could just press a button and say, "Play Mumford and Sons," and it would just start playing...
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   >> Can't you do that in your Ford?
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   >> Yeah, actually, I can.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640]   >> Okay, so let's do it now.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   >> And I can do it on the Android phone, too.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   But finally, you'll be able to do that on an iPhone.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   The idea is that they've bought-- remember they bought Siri, this really kind of cool application where you could say, "Book a table for two at Cyrus," and it would go out and do what you do.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   >> Sure.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   >> Yeah, it's voice control on steroids.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   It's the new assistant.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   >> So it has a deep voice is what you're saying.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   >> It will not work on earlier versions of the iPhone.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   Probably won't even work on the low end because the new iPhone has not only a dual core processor but a gig of RAM, and you do need that kind of horsepower.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   >> Okay.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.640]   >> This thing, okay, this thing is like HAL 9000, according to the rumors.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   >> That's what I want in my life.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   >> I'm sorry, Patrick.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   >> A homicidal computer that locks me in space.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   >> That's great.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   >> This is great.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   >> As you are dying.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   >> I'll take two.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   >> So you could say, "Book a table for two at Cyrus," and the phone will say, "John, did you mean for me to book a table for two at Cyrus?"
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   And you'll say, "Yes," and it will do that.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   What if the place is closed?
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   And what hours?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   How much details do you have to give this thing?
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   This is a useless feature.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   >> It's the cloud, John.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   It can do anything.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   >> I'm sorry, John.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   >> What about this rumor that the iPod Classic is dead?
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   >> That actually doesn't surprise me.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   >> Nobody's buying them.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   >> Yeah, I think basically people who travel out of range of Spotify or whatever your favorite subscription music service is and want their entire record collection, which is basically like me and eight other people, still buy iPod Classics.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   >> I love Spotify.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   >> I think they probably just want to get -- yeah, you know what I mean?
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   Like music nerds love them.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   There will be an aftermarket for them.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   But I think beyond that --
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   >> The only rumor I've heard is that there will be an iPod Touch.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   >> Right.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   >> But I haven't heard anything about updated iPods.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   If they either don't kill them or they're certainly not going to update them.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   >> Or they kill them.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   >> But I think they're going to do what they did with the Apple II.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   If you remember the Apple II Forever movement where they brought the kind of the cool one and that was Apple II Forever?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   That was it.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   >> It was Apple II's dead.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   >> Apple had a big trade show.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   It was in 1984, '85, after the Mac came out, in which they said -- they called it Apple II Forever.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.640]   Don't worry.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   We're not going to kill the Apple II.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   We're going to keep doing it forever or for the next six months, whichever comes first.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   They did.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   They shortly after killed it.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   >> I wouldn't mind seeing like a half terabyte or a terabyte iPod Touch.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   >> Make one for the -- right, right, for the audio.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.640]   >> For a maniac.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   You're saying you want an --
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   >> I want my entire lossless audio collection on a portable device.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   >> In WAV format.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.640]   >> No, no.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   >> Do you use FLAC?
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   >> I use FLAC when -- no, basically everything's Apple lossless because everything we're running in the house is, you know, iOS something or other at this point.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   >> Wow.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   It would be a bit of a stunner.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   You know, it's been exactly ten years, hasn't it?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   It was 2001 that the first iPod came out.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   >> Yeah, I was just thinking how iconic that is.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   Right, it's like the Apple II, right?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   Of course they have to kill it at some point and move on.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   But Steve Jobs' last decade there has kind of been personified by those first, you know, silhouette advertisements of the people with the iPods and the things sticking out of it.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   And to kill that off at the same time that Steve is leaving the company, I think -- I mean, I think you guys are absolutely right.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   It's probably destined to happen.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   I would love a half terabyte or a terabyte iPod just to, you know, for the iconic value of it.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   It doesn't serve much of a purpose anymore.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   But it's really -- the timing is very interesting.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   And I think it's, you know, we move past the icon of the iPod and past the icon of the man at the same time.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   >> Go on.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   >> Well done, Chuck.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   Actually, I had to get up because I had to go to my office to get the new terabyte iPod just for you.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   Look at that.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   >> Yes.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   >> It's a beauty.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   >> Yes.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   >> It's got the rolling click wheel.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   It's only a little bit thicker than the classic.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.640]   This is actually the very first iPod.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   And now with FireWire.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   >> It's all scratched to crap, if you haven't noticed.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   >> Well, and you know how big this was?
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   Five gigabytes.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   >> Beautiful.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   >> It's a beautiful thing.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   I'm out of breath because I had to run and get that.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   But there it is.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.640]   >> But that device still works.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   >> It actually has the real rolling --
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   >> It also completely changed the --
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   >> Still works.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   >> Completely changed the online music market.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   >> Look at the size of that connector.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   >> Remember, Patrick, I mean, when this came out in -- what was it, September 2001?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   You and I had spent probably the previous six months on the screen savers talking about devices.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   In fact, there's another one.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   Is there anybody around that can go into my cupboard?
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   Because I actually have the --
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   >> He has every iPhone ever produced.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   >> We've got a little tech museum in here.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   But we have a head end that goes in the car.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Remember this?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   And it would have a hard drive in the trunk.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   And we spent a lot of time talking about you'd run Linux on this thing.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   Chad, it's in my shelves there, the top shelf on the left.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   It looks like a car stereo.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   So we were -- remember this?
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.640]   And it was such a big deal.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   And then the Diamond Rio came out.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   >> That was --
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   >> And this was like a big breakthrough.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   >> iRiver.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   >> iRiver.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   Well, I don't think the iRiver was out.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   >> That was later.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   >> That came later.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   >> But this transformed it all.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   Because -- yeah, there it is.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   >> Yeah, because somebody knew how to market it.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   That's what transformed it.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   Look at that thing.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   >> This is --
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.640]   >> That came much later.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   >> This is later.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   This is Rio Digital Audio.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   And the whole idea was people would put this in the car, and it would be their car stereo.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   And they'd have a hard drive in the trunk.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   We've come a long way.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   And it's really thanks to this.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.640]   This really changed everything.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   But I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   You're right.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   Everybody's buying iPhones or other phones that have plenty of capacity on there.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   I put -- in this phone, I put a 32-gig SD card.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   And, you know, it's got now 40 gigs in here.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   You already saw this phone.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   I know what you're up to.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   Yes.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   Okay, Chad, you may take that back and put it in the zoo.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   We have a lot of old stuff.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   So do you think it will be possible that they'll kill off the iPod?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   We all think so.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   It's so sad.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   It's so sad.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   We're going to come back.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   We do have to talk about Microsoft and the deal they made with Samsung, which is pissing me off.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   I'll bet it is.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.640]   Pissing me off.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   Oh, he said it twice.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   You'd be collecting the money, too.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   Well, do they have the patents?
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   Show me the source code.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.640]   That's the problem.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   They never show anything, do they?
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   I'll tell you what.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   They may not have the patents.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   They're like McCarthy with the shake in the papers.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   They made a deal with somebody.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   Was it HTC where the HTC said, "We didn't know what they had because until we signed an NDA, they wouldn't show us what they had."
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:54.640]   I mean you actually had to practically agree that you were wrong to even see the evidence.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   Anyway, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   I'm going to calm down now.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   I want to take you to a very nice, quiet -- I'm going to take you to my special quiet place right now, Squarespace.com.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   See, this always makes me feel better when I go to Squarespace.com.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   It's because it works.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   It does work.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   Do you have a Squarespace site?
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   I do.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   Do you really?
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   Yes.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   Do you ever put anything on it?
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   Yes.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   I'm actually in the course of the process of rebuilding it right now.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   I remember when we forced you to have a blog.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   Yes.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   And you blogged once.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   It was a great entry.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.640]   I got several hundred thousand views in the first day.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   And that was it.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   And you and Kevin got off my ass and I walked away from it and wrote to make money, which I could not do on that blog.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   Right.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   That's a good point.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   It would have been a lot easier if Squarespace had been around then.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   Squarespace was started by a couple of great guys, Anthony Castellana and Dane --
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   Atkinson.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   Atkinson, thank you.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.640]   They were college kids and they wanted a better way to blog.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   Anthony was.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   Anthony was a college kid.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   What was Dane?
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   He was just a programmer, Dan?
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   Yeah, Dane's actually -- this is not a plug for Squarespace at all, but Dane's -- the whole team at Squarespace are good buddies.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   And Dane is a very cool, geo-local new company here.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   But Dane is a little bit older.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   He's been around the VC block a couple of times, run a few companies.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   So it was -- Anthony wrote the stuff and then brought in Dane to help him run the business.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   Yeah, yeah, right, right.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   Got it, got it, got it.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:22.640]   Well, I got to say, brilliant, because it's not just great software, which is, of course, what happened with Anthony, but they've also got the best hosting.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   And I think that that really solves a problem for a lot of people.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   When you want to create your new website, you've got to find a web host and then you have to figure out how to put stuff on it.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   This solves that completely.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   It's all in Java.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   You Java 1 fans will love that, including an amazing, very sophisticated Java virtual server technology that means you always have plenty of bandwidth.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   It's impossible to bring down a Squarespace site.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   It's incredible.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   Why don't you make one for yourself right now?
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   Just go to Squarespace.com.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.640]   You click that green button.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   All you need is a name for your site.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   What should we call it?
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   Twitch.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Twitch.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   What was it?
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   Twitch.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   This week in computerhardware.squarespace.com, password Patricklovescoffee, and then the email address leo@leoville.com.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   That's how easy it is.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   Now, if somebody has Twitch, it won't work, but let's see.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   Oh, good.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   Nobody had Twitch.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   So now, that's it.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   Did you notice I didn't put in a credit card number?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   I didn't give them any personal information.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Just the email so they can notify me after two weeks when the site's expiring.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   For now, for two weeks, I have the complete, full Squarespace features.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   I have all of the incredible tools, the design tools.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   And, by the way, 60-plus designer templates mean you start with the basics, and then you can do amazing stuff.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   You don't have to know JavaScript or CSS, but if you do, of course, you can modify it to your heart's content.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   It supports everything.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.640]   They've got great plug-ins, too, for social media, so it's very simple.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:58.640]   Did you see that?
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.640]   I'm now in.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   I got a site.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   Now, I gave you the password, so I'm just going to let you all mess with this site.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Here we go.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   We'll come back later and check it out.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   Yeah, it'll be dirty.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   What was the password again?
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   Do you remember that?
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.640]   Patricklovescoffee.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.640]   That's what it was.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.640]   Twitch.squarespace.com.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   Now, if you like that site after creating it, you can sign up after two weeks and say, "That's going to make it mine."
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   The longer you sign up for it, the less it costs.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   To your commitment, you get $10 a month, monthly $13.33 a month.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   But here's the special deal I want to tell you about.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   If you use the offer code TWIT10, because we're in October now, TWIT10, you'll get 20% off for the first six months of your site.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   You get an additional incentive to give it a try.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   Free to try, very affordable to run.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   It's hosting plus the best software out there.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   This is the great way to create websites.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   We'll go back and check twitch.squarespace.com a little later on.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   There it is.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   There's already a photo.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   You don't want to put it on?
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   It's a broken phone booth.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.640]   Oh, Patrick, that's your sledgehammer.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   Oh, my God.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   That's a pickaxe.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   A carry pickaxe.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   Very similar, though.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.640]   Hard to conceal.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   Oh, yeah, you say.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   That's not my pickaxe.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   That couldn't be my pickaxe.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   So Microsoft has been going around suing people.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   Suing Android handset manufacturers, to be specific.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   Suing or threatening?
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   There's a big difference.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   That's a good question.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   Or, excuse me, suing or negotiating?
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   Sorry.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   In some cases, of course, they're probably saying, "You owe us some money, man."
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   And they just say, "Yeah, here."
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   In some cases, it probably has to go a little farther.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.640]   This is something I tweeted out earlier this week.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   So it's like, this is a huge pile of money, fiscal year 2000, or for any company other than somebody like Google or Microsoft.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   This is a guess.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, Microsoft is getting, in this Samsung deal, or maybe it's total.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   I guess it's total, $3 to $6 per device.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   Now, remember, there's more than half a million Android phones activated daily.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   So they say there's as much as half a billion dollars from Android patent licenses.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   Yeah, for fiscal year 2012, so July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, $3 to $6 for Android device sold.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   Settlements from Samsung, HTC, and others.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   A bunch of others, actually.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   I think there's four or five manufacturers.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   And, of course, they're going to just continue to knock them off like ten pins.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   Why don't they go after Google?
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   Maybe because they don't make a phone?
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   I think partially at this point because I think there's a really interesting line that Google's kind of standing up on one side of it
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   and Microsoft is on the other.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   And is Google going to basically start hurling money at giant fleets of lawyers to try to work their way through the courts to change patent law in the United States?
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   Or are they going to try to basically drop a giant series of checks in Washington to try to change patent law by legislature?
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   Here's my problem.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   Show me the source code.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   No.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   The answer is no.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   I mean they do not – what they do not want to have happen is two things.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   One, you don't want the legislation to – you don't want to go the legislative route unless you are positive you have bought those legislators because it will establish law that could not be in your favor.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   And you definitely don't want to go to court because you could set a precedent that could absolutely not be in your favor.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   So, I mean I would say settlement privately is probably – and again, I'm only speculating.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   I don't have any knowledge of this.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   But I would say the last thing you want to do is have a precedent that is not in your favor because it's very hard to overturn that.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   I guess though that about $444 million would be sufficient to buy Congress.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   Well, they're getting a little pricey now.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   Are they getting more expensive?
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   Well, to put that into context, right, Business Insider does point out that this sounds like a lot of money until you realize that Microsoft is expected to make $75 billion during the same time.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   So, $444 million is kind of a rounding error at this point.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   Microsoft says – this is actually Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith according to Ina Fried writing for All Things D.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   "So far we have not seen a single Android device that does not infringe on our patents."
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   It's going after each and every one of them one by one and knocking them all down.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   That's what you're supposed to do if you have patents.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   The difference between – I just wish one of these companies would stand up and fight.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   I don't know what they're doing.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   Maybe it's cheaper not to fight.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   There's probably some calculation made.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   I'm sure it's cheaper not to fight and that's exactly what they do.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   They say, well, give us exactly the right amount of money that it's – the pain threshold is just low enough so that you'd rather give it to them than sue.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.640]   What's interesting is that Google hasn't picked this fight.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   But I think it goes back to what Dan was just saying.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   Google doesn't want to pick this fight and then find out that Google says –
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   I think they've got to wait until the Motorola deal is finalized.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   Then maybe, yeah.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.640]   That's when things really get interesting.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:07.640]   Google says this, quote, "This is the same tactic we've seen time and time again from Microsoft.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   Failing to succeed in the smartphone market, they are resorting to legal measures to extort profit from others' achievements and hinder the pace of innovation."
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   But why don't they indemnify Android handset manufacturers?
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   They will when this Motorola thing is done.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   So that's when the big battle begins.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   So they're essentially – they're amassing on the battlefield Waterloo massive armies.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   But they won't engage until that army is there and positioned and ready to fight.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.640]   Yeah, they're all ready to go.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.640]   It's magic the gathering with patents.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   Magic the gathering.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   Patents the gathering.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   I like that.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   Yes.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   Interesting that you should say that because – let's see.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.640]   Have you got a game show coming up?
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   Yes.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   As a matter of fact, we do.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   But that's another story entirely.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   I'm looking for the quote here.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:19.640]   Brad Smith says at the end of this article, "Regarding patent issues, ultimately we will see licensing regimes emerge."
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   Like the MPEG-4 consortium.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   This doesn't mean there won't be some dramatic events between now and that time happens.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   It really does sound like Waterloo.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   It sounds like massive nations mobilizing.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   Something's got to happen.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   What a mess.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   The problem is that $444 million is just thrown away essentially.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   It's money that could be used to hire people, to innovate, to invent.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   It's offsetting Bing losses.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   And it just barely does that.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   What was Bing's loss last year?
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:55.640]   Actually, did you guys talk last week about the people walking out of the –
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   We did and we talked about it on Windows Weekly as well.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   The contention was from – there's a blog called Mini Microsoft, which sounds silly, but it's a Microsoft employee who is a real employee.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   Mary Jane Foley says she knows who it is, but of course this person doesn't reveal his identity.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.640]   And he was writing about the big company meeting, which was the 23rd.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   A number of bloggers said people were walking out on Steve Ballmer.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.640]   However –
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   That worked there?
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   Yes.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   However, most people have responded, "Look, it's Safeco Field.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   People are coming and going all –"
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   What, he's giving a speech at Safeco Field?
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   It's like 30,000 – well, it's Microsoft.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   Is that like a religious thing?
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   It's like a gathering, holding a Bible and shaking it?
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.640]   If you've ever been to a ball game, people come and go.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   They buy hot dogs.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   They go to the bathroom.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   That's all it was.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   And he actually reports back in here.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   It's mostly anonymous comments.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   He admits that it wasn't the most exciting thing in the world, but of course it was a company meeting.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.640]   It was, except for the part where he jumps out of the cake and runs around and yells, "Developers, developers, developers."
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   He didn't do it this time.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Oh, that's no good.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   As for Mr. Balmer, it was a surprise that he didn't come out running and screaming, but rather had a surrogate fly around like a chimp on crack dusted with meth.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   What? Where's this?
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.640]   Wow.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   This is in mini Microsoft.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.640]   Can I get one of those delivered to a friend of mine's office?
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.640]   I don't know who the surrogate was.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   Mr. Balmer seemed more subdued this year.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   Love for Balmer, people still stood up and cheered and clapped for him.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   Good thing for Hitler.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   Somebody brought in Hitler.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   Godwin's happy.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   As for people leaving, as some of the tech bloggers have picked up, yeah, people were streaming out in small numbers, nowhere near as bad as Bill Gates' last company meeting, where Balmer started screaming at people to sit down.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   Where are you going? Sit down!
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   I could see Balmer doing that.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   And, yes, I was one of those folks who wandered to the upper portion of the seats while Mr. Balmer passed on his coachy wisdom from Friday Night Lights.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   I suppose if Microsoft had been serving beer and snacks after the meeting, I would have managed to stay in my seat.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   So there you go. I think it's a tempest.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   This is a great blog.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640]   Oh, it's a wonderful blog.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   I don't know. I have a couple of friends who were discussing it on e-mail and sharing their thoughts with me, and they felt that a lot of people felt really demoralized by this meeting.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   They may feel demoralized by every single meeting, but nobody ever asked them about it before until this blog entry went up.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.640]   Don't you think if you worked at Microsoft – I mean, look, I know there are many people listening and watching this show who do.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   I know many people at Microsoft who are excited about what they're doing, but it's got to be overall kind of a bummer working there.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   It's not as interesting – years ago, there's been a change in the mentality of the Microsoft employee.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   I remember like 10, 15 years ago when you were giving a speech or you were talking about Microsoft as the evil empire.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   The Microsofties in the audience would gloat and they'd smile, and they thought this is great.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   We're the evil empire.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   We're number one.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   If you do that now, you actually hurt their feelings.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   Is that because the stock options have run out and it's actually more of a career decision?
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   I think it's different people too because of that.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   It's interesting, though. Their feelings can be hurt because you don't have the sense anymore.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   We tried so hard, and he's making fun of us.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   I remember in –
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   I like Windows 7.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   When I lived in the Silicon Valley in the late '70s when Atari was just king of the world.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640]   They couldn't do any wrong.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   And these guys were the most arrogant people I'd ever met because I'm – I remember a guy who was a programmer for Atari.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   I've never met a more arrogant person.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   I invited him over to the house to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   He says, "That's the size of your TV?"
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.640]   I'm not kidding.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   You've got him beat now.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   I got him beat now.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   But the point was that a couple of years later –
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   Probably in the corner drunk somewhere.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.640]   Yeah, the worst thing you could be was an Atari employee.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   This is how things work in technology.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   Nobody's number one for very long.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   And you should probably not gloat because in the long run, what goes around comes around.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   Windows 8's newest interface, by the way, this just out from the Twitch blog.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.640]   And then –
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   That was the joy of tech.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   Listen to me.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   Apple Computer is going to ditch the Mac OS for Microsoft Windows.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   You did say that, didn't you, John?
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   I actually didn't quite say that.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   Oh, come on. Own it.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   I like the cartoon.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.640]   Yeah, that actually was many years ago, wasn't it?
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   I've written almost 5,000 columns, and once in a while you make a mistake.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   You might so.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   People never remember when you got it right.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   That's the problem.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   That one time.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   That one time you got it right.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.640]   Column 3605.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   Are you going to go down and occupy Wall Street next weekend?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   You know, this is going on in San Francisco, and it's not being reported at all.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   Really?
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   Same thing, and it's happening in Los Angeles, Boston, every place around the country these things are going on, these little protests.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   And the media has decided, ah, we're not going to report any of it.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   Dan, you've talked a little bit about this because it's in your neck of the woods, right?
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   Look, I'm the kind of reporter when I hate sitting behind a desk.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   If there is something happening, especially if it's happening in my backyard, I want to be there.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   I want to hear about it.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   I want to see it.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   And I want to experience it.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   And I'm absolutely nonpartisan when it comes to covering what happens.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   And the real story here, and we threw this into the rundown, is not the particular politics of those involved.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:38.640]   But it is how the group has organized and really used the social web to -- I don't want to say force.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   I think that that is a little strong -- but coax traditional media into covering the event.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   Now, clearly I work for traditional media, but I wasn't assigned to this.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   I just heard about it and got down there the first day that I could get down there.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.640]   I love what you did, by the way, on Storify.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   This is a unique way to cover something like this.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   Well, this is a slow-moving, ongoing story.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   And really, you know, the best tools that we have -- you know, I covered the Republican riots that happened,
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.640]   the Republican conventions in 2008, and I got the crap beat out of me.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   I got some protester punch me in the gut and took some of my gear.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.640]   So now I really just go down with -- now, look, I mean, Patrick, I grew up listening to the dead Kennedys.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   [Explosion]
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.640]   Here's some audio from --
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   At Zuccotti Park for Occupy Wall Street.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   Behind me are the sounds of Occupy Wall Street.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   The march has begun.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.640]   The protesters are --
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.640]   I love it that you posted this on SoundCloud.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   There are lines of police everywhere, thousands of protesters.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   Behind me you hear the sounds.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   I don't know what your masters at ABC Radio News thought of this or if they even know about it.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   Over-large, so we'll see.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   But can I tell you something?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   This is the future of reporting.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   I mean, this is amazing.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   If people want to know more, it's Storify.com/DanPatterson.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   Storify is a site that lets you kind of build this kind of multimedia presentation with Flickr and tweets, maps, audio.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   Because it's an ongoing story, I can -- you know, I'll be down there again tomorrow afternoon.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:21.640]   And, again, I just want to present what I see, not necessarily what one particular agenda may or may not want.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   And Storify is really a very good way to show, like, here is what I've seen.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   Here is what I've observed.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Initially the protests were very, very small.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   It was a couple dozen to a couple hundred people last week.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   When I was there on Friday, there were -- you know, one police officer told me that there were 3,000 people there.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   Some of that was due to the rumors that Radiohead was going to be in attendance.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   And social media certainly helped spread that.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   But that rumor died away through the afternoon.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   People stayed.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   The energy stayed high.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   And the transit workers joined the protest a little later in the afternoon.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   That was interesting.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.640]   You noted that the unions had started to show up.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   Right.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   And much of this was because -- I don't want to say that mainstream media has not covered this.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   I think that would get me into trouble, and I don't think that that is true.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   But I do think that the social web has covered this much better than traditional media has.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   And I think that the unions were there, and there were 3,000 people there cheering them on because of the social web, not because of traditional media.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   I mean, it's also -- a lot of traditional media outlets do not cover protests because they don't want to encourage people to shut down the Golden Gate Bridge, to shut down the Brooklyn Bridge.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   I also got to say, having -- I went to Pace.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.640]   I lived across the street from City Hall.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:40.640]   I've had to get through some interesting things to get to -- to get back to where I was living at that time or to get to the school.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   And props to you for going down there on the street because when things get squirrely in a protest -- and they rarely do -- but when they do get squirrely, it is a very frightening place to be because there's generally nowhere to run to down there.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   Right.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   Except for the subways, and that's generally not a place where you feel really safe.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   I'm kind of interested to see this, though, because I think laying this economy in the laps -- squirrely in the laps of Wall Street is highly appropriate.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   And I think that it's -- this is a real grassroots movement.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640]   This is very interesting.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   This is not what Congress is talking about.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   This is not what mainstream media is talking about.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   I'd be very curious to see if this snowballs.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   There's one going on in San Francisco right now?
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   I do not know.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.640]   On and off.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   That's my understanding.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640]   My son told me that.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   He said there's no coverage at all.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   And I think you're probably right.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   They don't want to cover it because they don't want people shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   But it's not the job of the fourth estate to do the job, police work for the U.S. government or the local governments or any other governments.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   I think there is a note of responsibility where you don't want to obviously do something that would make people crazy.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   And if you notice on football, baseball games where the streaker runs out, they never show it.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   I think they should.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   That's because they don't want to show penile.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   And, John, in defense of --
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   No, they don't want other people running around.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   In defense of traditional media, before -- and I do have to tell you, until this past Friday, it was reasonably small, a couple dozen to a couple hundred people.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   And the mainstream media, traditional media, doesn't want to -- there are a lot of reasons to say I am nonpartisan.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   There is no such thing as an objective journalist.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   But the audience needs to trust that I'm not bringing an agenda to a particular story.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   And you can -- traditional media could validate something that is a very small and, you know, this protest aside, a -- let's say a nut job protest could gather the same amount of people.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   And if traditional media covers that, it kind of validates that and lends credibility in a particularly partisan direction one way or another.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   I'm not going to disagree with that.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   But they do that all the time.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   I'm not disagreeing with that either.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   I just think that that's why it's my job to get down there and say I don't have a -- you know, I'm not in this fight.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   You have no agenda.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   I just want to show you what I see.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   Right.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   I have no agenda.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   Come on.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   How can I have an agenda?
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   In the morning.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640]   How's Adam Curry doing, by the way?
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   I used to be on Pod Show back in the day.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   He's looking for a house in Austin.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   Austin, Texas?
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   Really?
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   That's very Adam Curry.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   He moved from the Netherlands to England to Austin?
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   No, to Los Angeles.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   Oh, he's in L.A.?
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   Now he wants to be in Texas.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   He's flying out as we speak.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   He'll probably be landing tonight.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   I wonder why Austin.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   Does he --
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   He went and took a round and looked around the country.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   It's a great city.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   I love it.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   He hates Los Angeles.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   Well, there you have it.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   That's enough said.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   So, yeah, that's where he is.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   He's going to move to Austin, he thinks.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   He thinks.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   Anyway, congratulations.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   Interesting choice on Storify.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   I think that's a good way to do it, Dan.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   Yeah, good work.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   Yeah, and good work.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.640]   And this is, you know, I think a great example of what an individual can do.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   Right, right.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   It doesn't -- you know, you don't need -- I do have the press credentials next to my name,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   and I do have a news organization next to my name, but you don't need that.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.640]   You know, there were tons of people down there doing exactly the same thing.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   I'm willing to bet SoundCloud has a lot of audio that isn't just mine up there, and this is --
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   Do people use -- it's interesting because at SoundCloud I know because my son puts his beats up there.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   But people use it for this kind of stuff as well?
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   I'm using it for this now.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   That's great.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   I'm putting all of the interviews.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   You know, I've conducted well over 200 interviews with people at the United Nations, which is kind of a boring subject.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   But it's, you know, interesting when you can -- if you have one particular interest or another, you can really drill --
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   it's the YouTube of audio.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   I don't need to sell it or to plug it, but it's the YouTube of audio, and it's a great place to do something like this.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   Or Instagram for audio.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   Think of it like that, the app is.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:42.640]   Yahoo is hosting a big mystery press conference on Monday.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   John, any thoughts about what this --
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   Well, you know, the Alibaba guy wants to buy them.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   You think they'll -- that's a Chinese search engine.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   You think they'll sell?
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   Well, the guy is -- he's been around.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.640]   Well, I think this has something to do with it.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   What else would they have this press conference for?
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640]   Well, it could be some boring thing like --
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   Oh, they were going to cancel a whole bunch of stuff like they always do?
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   They could have decided to create a new interface for Yahoo TV.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   I mean, it could be that.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   Wally Ballew.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   Wally Ballew reporting.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   If it's a web redesign, who cares?
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   On the other hand, it sounds like we might want to cover this.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   There's no gossip.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.640]   Yeah, you should.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   There is no gossip.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   I mean, would that be a huge story if Yahoo said, "We've decided to sell to China"?
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   For the business world, yeah.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   I think it's a big story for everybody because --
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   You're going to cover it?
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   You're going to send its crew down there?
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   I think we should send a crew down there.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   What time Monday morning?
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   Is it before 11?
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   Because I don't really want to --
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   If he doesn't like to get up.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   You wouldn't go anyway.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   You'd send a crew.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   Wouldn't you just send your people?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.640]   Yes, I'll have people go there.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   We are going to cover -- by the way, I didn't mention this,
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   but we will do live coverage of the Apple announcement.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   Somebody in the chat room suggested a Yahoo tablet.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   It's shaped like a pyramid.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern is the Apple event on Tuesday.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   We'll definitely cover that.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   And I'll tell you what, we will pay close attention to whatever Yahoo announces,
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.640]   and if it is something, we'll break in and let you know about it.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   You do the best job of covering this stuff.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   We try to.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   No, seriously, I'm dead serious.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   They actually send people and nobody else covers it,
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   and you can get streaming half the time.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   I'm trying to do that.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   Now I wish Apple would stream --
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   You two have been rubbing off on each other.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   This is like the first time in this podcast where he's been like, "You do a great job."
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   He does a great job on certain things.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   But you've been talking nice about technology, too.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   It's creepy, man.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   You're weirding me out.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.640]   What did I say nice about anything?
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   Don Draper.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   Did you see this?
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   This actually is great.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   Somebody took a -- it's a mashup.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   Oh.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640]   There you have it.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   It didn't take that long.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640]   It's off the air.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   Yeah, it was a mashup between Lionsgate producers, of course, Mad Men.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   And what they did is they had Don Draper, who's in the '60s at an ad agency, talking about --
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   Slide projectors.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   Well, it was originally about Kodak, Keller, Carousel slide projectors,
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   but they took that and they made it about Facebook timeline.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   And it actually was right on.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   It was exactly what Mark Zuckerberg probably would like to say about it.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   Oh, but I can't show it to you because it's been pulled down on YouTube.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   There's a backup, I think.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.640]   BuzzFeed.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   Yeah, BuzzFeed is probably linking back to the YouTube, I would guess.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   Shall I try clicking on that link?
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.640]   Yeah, give it a click and see what happens.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   You can't really keep anything off the internet.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.640]   Listen to this.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   Now, this is going to guarantee we get pulled by Lionsgate.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   Clip it out.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   Who cares?
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   [Video]
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   I love this.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   This is how ad men talked.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   In the '60s, they may still talk this way.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   Remember, they're selling you mouthwash.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   [Video]
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   If you're a Mad Men fan, of course, you realize that he's looking at slides of himself, his ex-wife,
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.640]   the children he left behind, himself sleeping on the couch.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   Peter.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.640]   He's talking about a Kodak carousel projector.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   It goes backwards.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.640]   It could be Facebook Timeline, couldn't it?
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   That's the images.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   It takes us to a place where we ache to go again.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   All right, that's enough of that.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   It's not as good as I hoped.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640]   Well, I'm trying, you know.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   But this is the Facebook Timeline.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.640]   I actually turned it on on my Facebook account.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   What do you think of it?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.640]   Have you guys played with this at all?
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   You're asking me?
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   See, look at that.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   There's my family.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   Why would I want something like that?
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   You scroll down.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   You can see what I did, where I went, what pictures I have.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   I can go back to the 2000s.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   That's back when I worked at --
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   This is just so the government can use this against you at some point in the future.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   A little place called Tech TV, you may remember.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   I think this is exactly why people are kind of creeped out in ways that are inarticulatable.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   Like, you know, people will always say, I distrust, I don't know, there's something about Facebook.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   I think it's a cynical exploitation of nostalgia for business purposes.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   Yeah, like me and my daddy back in 1956 when I was born.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   Yeah, until the IRS agent comes up and asks you questions.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   You think that's what this is all about?
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   Come on.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   Absolutely.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   There's a certain amount of ego involved because, of course, you know, I don't think anybody would want to see my timeline except me.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   What were you pointing out there, Patrick, of this picture?
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.640]   Roger looking 12.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   Roger does look awfully young in that picture.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640]   Who's that guy standing there in the vest?
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   Oh, that's me.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   I have to put some more pictures in there with you.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.640]   I'll find them.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   Are there any pictures of us together?
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   Never taken.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   In fact, never.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   I think I have a few somewhere.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   I don't know.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Facebook itself just is not a place I spend much or any time.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   I go up there like once a quarter.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   I tell people to don't be upset I haven't friended you because I haven't been there in three months.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:58.640]   Don't you think it's amazing that half a billion people in one day used Facebook?
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640]   Sure.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   Yes.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Doesn't that tell you something?
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   Yeah, it tells you people are nuts.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   That's not you.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   There it is.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   Speaking of having hair, you look so awesome.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   There you go.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640]   I'll put that on the Facebook page.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   Then you'll check it out.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.640]   You look better today.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   Yeah, that was a--
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Why do you guys need a mustache?
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   That's from our porn era.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   Actually, it was part of a really peculiar conversation where they were talking about people in the military having to sort of be reminded that operational security applies to Facebook.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.640]   Right, because they post all sorts of stuff on there.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   That's right.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   That's right.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   We'd like to share.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   At least that's what Mark Zuckerberg says.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   I don't know.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   Those were the days, Patrick.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.640]   Don't you want to go back and relive those times?
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   I couldn't keep a girlfriend for six weeks back in those days.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   So, this part of me, it's like I'm really cool with the whole being married and having kids now.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640]   It's a different time now.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   It's much better.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.640]   It was awesome.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   No, it's much better now.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   I have to agree with you.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.640]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   Patrick Norton, my old buddy, is here.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   As long as John C. Dvorak.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   I have a Silicon Spin episode I should play.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   I have boxes of tapes.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   Do you?
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   I have all the shows.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   He took every show home.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   Yeah, because they were throwing them out like they were doing with everything.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   I wish I had grabbed the big thinkers.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   I want the one where the three analysts told me that I did not understand WebVAM when I told them it was a smoking crater three months before they were out of business.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   Oh, you were so smart.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640]   Wouldn't you love to have that?
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   We blasted them from the get-go.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   But, yeah, one of these days I'm going to give these tapes to someone who can digitize them all and we'll put them in a database.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.640]   Real or real?
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   No, yeah, almost.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.640]   No, they're digital.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   There's some C format digital or something.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   Beta SP or something.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   By the way, it didn't take him very long to get that image right there on our new This Week in Computer Hardware Squarespace blog.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   Hi, I'm Patrick Norton and I love coffee.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.640]   Hosted in the morning by Patrick Norton, Ryan Schautt, and Pikachu Kitty.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   This is good.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   You guys are good.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   I'm telling you.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   It's a nightmare.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   Squarespace, baby.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.640]   Also here, Dan Patterson from ABC Radio News.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.640]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   And we know Jan's a journalist because he has a map of the world on his wall.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   Look at that.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   Right above his teletype.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.640]   You know, I tried to get a teletype for the studio.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   Wouldn't it have been great if we could have in the background of the show.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   Quick, this just in.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   Yahoo sold to--I better not say that.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   A lot of people will believe it.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   Right, right.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.640]   Who knows?
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   It's going to happen any moment now.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.640]   Audible.com, my friends.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   Audible is the place to go to get audio entertainment.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   I am listening--you know, you're a Neil Gaiman fan, I know.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.640]   I am.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.640]   American God is one of his great novels.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   I have a copy in the front of my truck I'm sending to my cousin.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640]   That's how good it is.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   The unabridged edition.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640]   My favorite copy.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   Well, there's a new edition, as you know, because--in fact,
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   Neil talks about it in the introduction to the 10th anniversary edition,
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   how he had to cut a lot out and he went back--
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   12,000 words.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   So, Audible has an incredible, incredible full production,
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   dramatized production of American God.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   It's highly recommended.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   But then I talk about that and then, of course, there's Moneyball,
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   much better than Brad Pitt in the movie,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   the great Michael Lewis novel--true story--about the A's of 2004
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   and how they used stats to win.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.640]   And then I say, "Wait a minute.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.640]   Neil Stevenson, Ream D."
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   Is that new?
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   Yeah, the new Neil Stevenson.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.640]   Now I have it on Kindle.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.640]   I have it on Audible.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   In fact, I'm going to go out and get the hardcover because I just want to make sure
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   Neil keeps writing books.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   Yes.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.640]   And I know you feel that way too.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   This is 38 hours, and it's kind of a genre book, I think.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   It's actually--it goes back to a lot of the stuff he did in the past.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Is it like Snow Crash?
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   It's like Snow Crash but more believable.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   I'm a huge fan of--Cryptonomicon is one of my favorite novels of all time.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   Anathem, his last one, I liked a lot.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.640]   I know you read the Quicksilver trilogy.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   Yes, I actually am in the process of rereading the Quicksilver trilogy.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   They have that at Audible too, you know.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.640]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   If you're driving to Nebraska, that's what you need.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   Anyway, this is the problem.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   Audible is incredible, and there's so many great books.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.640]   So let's do this.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.640]   Let's get you two.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can sign up for the Platinum Plan.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   That's two books a month.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   Your first month's free, your first two books are free,
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   and yours to keep forever and ever.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   Cancel at any time.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   You don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   but I think you will want to stay Audible a subscriber.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   It's just fantastic.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.640]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.640]   By the way, when you get the subscription,
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.640]   you also get a free subscription to The Wall Street Journal
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   or New York Times daily audio programs.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.640]   So as you drive into work, you can listen to us
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640]   and maybe catch up on the news.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   Come home, you can listen to Reamde.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640]   You're going to love it.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   Audible.com/twit2, it is fantastic.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   Offered good in the U.S. and Canada.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   The U.S. and Canada.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   And if you're outside the U.S., you should still give Audible a try
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.640]   because they have Audible stores all over the world now.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.640]   Just really great stuff.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.640]   It plays on your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom, many Kindle devices,
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.640]   although no longer all Kindle devices.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   Make sure you check before you buy.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   And I love the Audible app on Android.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   It's fantastic.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.640]   And on iPhone.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them for their support.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   I'm stalling because John's wandered off.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   Should we play the "This Week Ahead"?
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640]   I'll tell you what, that's a good idea.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   Tom Merritt is here in our TNT newsroom.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   We've got a very big week ahead.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   Let's see what we'll be covering on TNT every weekday at 2:30 p.m.,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   5:30 p.m. Eastern on twit.tv.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   Tom?
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on for tech news today
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   and the week ahead.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   Today, Sunday, October 2nd, the LG Marquee for Sprint launches
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   and the Samsung Galaxy S2 comes to AT&T for $199.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.640]   Monday, October 3rd, kicks off two conferences,
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   Mipcom, the content conference in Cannes, France,
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:19.640]   and Adobe Max, Adobe's user conference, happens down in L.A.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   Tuesday, October 4th, is the anniversary of the creation of the Free Software Foundation,
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   and Apple has an iPhone announcement that some people may be paying attention to
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   down in Cupertino, California.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   Thursday, October 6th, HTC holds an event in London.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.640]   The invite reads, "Come feel every beat," and features a picture of some earbuds,
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.640]   so you can probably figure out the rest.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   Friday, October 7th, Sprint's strategy update at their investor conference
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.640]   is likely to detail their switch to LTE.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   And Saturday, October 8th, BIS 4.1, BlackBerry Internet server, arrives in the U.S.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   The rest of the world already had it.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   And the excitement is palpable.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.640]   Leo, let me--I got to ask--I got to ask Tom a question.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.640]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   So, Tom, what do you think about that BlackBerry announcement?
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.640]   Do you think it's going to mean anything?
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.640]   Hello, Tom? Tom!
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   Saturday, October 8th, BIS 4.1, BlackBerry Internet server, arrives in the U.S.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640]   The rest of the world already had it.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.640]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.640]   Is this--Tom, this is some robot.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   It's the TomBot.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   We've figured it out.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   Saves us a lot of money, let me tell you.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Here's a Twitter study that tracks where you are,
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:33.640]   drawing on messages posted by more than 2 million people in 84 countries.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]   Researchers--you want to see the graph--
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   discovered that the emotional tone of people's messages
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.640]   followed a similar pattern throughout the day,
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.640]   but also the weeks and the seasons.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.640]   Cornell University did this study.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   Okay.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   This is tracking positive words in posts.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.640]   So the more positive words, the happier you are.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   The fewer positive words, the less happy you are.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.640]   The best day, Saturday and Sunday.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   Yeah, that's because people don't have to go to work.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   It's so obvious.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.640]   What kind of research is this?
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   Did somebody spend money on this?
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   Hey, they got a grant, baby.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Right in the middle of the week, it's the worst.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   Gee.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640]   I think it's kind of interesting, though,
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.640]   because we do have this data from Twitter.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   It's interesting that the New York Times decided to put a happy face in the headline.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.640]   In emoticon.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   Yeah, they did.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.640]   It's amazing the New York Times used an emoticon.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640]   I don't know if that's--
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.640]   I think that's still legal.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.640]   I think that can't be in the style guide.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.640]   No.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.640]   Now, let me ask you, because that is the traditional colon, right, paren.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.640]   There's no dash, so that's a noseless.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.640]   No, but that's the more classic.
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   The nose one came later.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.640]   Do you think that that, in fact, is the New York Times style guide says no nose?
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.640]   I don't think that they know that this is up there, and if they found out, they'd be really upset.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   We had Nick Bilton on, and he was talking a lot about the--for instance, they require to do e-mail.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640]   They're very strict.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   Their style guide is very antiquated, but it's very strict, and so some copy editors--
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   They still use Mr. Laporte.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   They do.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   They still do.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640]   Even for felons.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   Fact checking.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640]   Fact checking?
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.640]   What's that?
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.640]   This is in the Journal of Science.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:23.640]   It's the first, John, in case you're interested, cross-cultural study of daily mood rhythms in the average person using Twitter textual analysis.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.640]   So basically the more likely you are to be drunk, the more likely you are to send positive messages.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   They don't mention drunk tweeting, but I think you're probably right.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.640]   I think the source of this is the most important part of this story, right?
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:47.640]   There's a ton of companies that do analysis of various parts of social media, and most of those companies are worth about as much as this 20-set of dye.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   But this comes from science and was reprinted in the New York Times.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.640]   Even if this is just confirmation bias or kind of telling us what we already know, this is interesting that it's coming from science and in the Times.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.640]   Does that make sense?
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.640]   I think it would be nice if they broke it down by demographics, age, gender.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   It would be more interesting.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   Yeah, everybody under 40 gets stupid drunk on Friday night and tweets madly.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   It gets more interesting towards the end of the article.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   Social scientists analyzing digital content agree that for all its statistical appeal, the approach still needs some fine-tuning.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   They'd agree with you.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   On Twitter, people routinely savage others with pure relish and gush sarcastically.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640]   My gosh!
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   Yeah, the software doesn't pick up sarcasm.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   And it doesn't pick up gushing, apparently.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:44.640]   Well, Dr. Gilbert, one of the researchers, says, "I suspect if you count the good and bad words people say during intercourse, you would mistakenly conclude they were having an awful time."
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.640]   Is that what he said?
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640]   Is that right?
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.640]   He said it just like Professor Van Drake.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.640]   Apparently, yeah.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.640]   One of my favorite voices.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.640]   Did you know that music piracy is going down?
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.640]   I'm sorry, Patrick.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.640]   Music piracy is going down?
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640]   I'm not buying that.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640]   I'm thinking of another mistaken association you would make.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   I know.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   I know.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   You really, that's true, though.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640]   You've got to let it go, Leo.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.640]   Right now.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640]   I'm not buying it.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   Next study.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   A new report looking at online music consumption habits says since 1999, since 2009, the number of people who pirate music has dropped in Sweden.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640]   In Sweden?
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.640]   By 25%.
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.640]   Well, music piracy has dropped in the United States.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.640]   Well, I presume this study only looked at Sweden, but I think it's dropped globally, of course.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   They say that the sharp decrease coincides with a massive interest in Spotify.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   What public relations agency planted this story to promote Spotify?
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:43.640]   And we're reading it.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.640]   You really think this is all of this?
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.640]   If it mentions one service by name, absolutely.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   Anecdotally, we can all agree that access to content legally and at an affordable price helps us decrease illegal activity.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   But, yeah, that it mentions one service, come on.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:10.640]   Music Sweden CEO Elisabeth Wiedlund says the long-term trend is a sharp increase.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.640]   No, she doesn't talk like that.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.640]   It sounds like she's a Nazi.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:21.640]   She talks like, "The long-term trend is a sharp increase in legal streaming while we see a reduction in legal..."
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.640]   Boy, you can't do the Swedish chef anymore, can you?
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.640]   I can't do it anymore.
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.640]   When 800,000 Swedes are willing to pay for streaming music...
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640]   You know what I do?
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640]   I think Ingmar Bergman.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.640]   I've never heard him speak.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.640]   No, but it comes to me.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   I think, you know, Der Duva.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   Did you ever see Der Duva?
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   No.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.640]   It was a parody of a Bergman movie.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.640]   "When Der Duva comes to the town..."
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.640]   Anyway, that's what I think.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:58.640]   "When 800,000 Swedes are willing to pay for streaming music, there's clearly a market for more legal players in the digital music market."
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.640]   It sounds like Bergman.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.640]   Give him a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   It sounds like Bergman, yeah.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   Well, I don't know why they tied it to Spotify.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:11.640]   Here's actually the article I was thinking of, March 24, 2011, up on mashable.com.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   Basically, we're looking at the stats.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:19.640]   "Percentage of U.S. Internet population using peer-to-peer file sharing service to download music decreased from 16 to 9 percent."
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   Wow.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   "28 million to 16 million users in the fourth quarter of 2010 when LimeWire was shut down."
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.640]   Well, that's the other reason, right?
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.640]   Because it was sued out of existence.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:40.640]   Between Q4 2007 and Q4 2010, the average number of music files downloaded drops by like 50 percent.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.640]   It's interesting to look that--
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:55.640]   It's also-- The other really good series of articles was pointing out that the recording industry, Artists Association, spent $64 million on lawyers to recover $1.4 million in settlements.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   So it could very well be--
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.640]   Another fine investment.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.640]   It could very well be the lawsuits. It could be the legal-- Success in legal battles as well as the fact that--
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:07.640]   I have to say Spotify is a great-- But you don't-- You like the hard copy.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.640]   I like using something like Spotify for discovery.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:12.640]   Exactly.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.640]   I don't really like--
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.640]   But then I'll buy the music if I like it, right?
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   Absolutely.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.640]   Yeah. But now, did you listen to "Flogging Molly's" new album on Spotify first?
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.640]   No, you bought it immediately.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.640]   No, I just bought it immediately.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.640]   Of course you did.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640]   I want them to be able to--
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640]   Who?
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640]   "Flogging Molly."
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.640]   It's a classic band thing.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:39.640]   According to RIM spokesman-- Spokeswoman Marissa Conway, rumors suggesting that the BlackBerry Playbook is being discontinued are pure fiction.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:46.640]   RIM remains highly committed to the tablet market and the future of QNX-- That's the operating system on the Playbook-- in its platform.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:53.640]   Meanwhile, cutting prices on the BlackBerry Playbook, $200 to $299.99 at Best Buy.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.640]   Does that sound committed or just--
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.640]   Committed, I think, is the right word.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.640]   Committed. It ought to be.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:10.640]   I think they're probably looking at the success of the $99 touchpad and saying, "Hmm, is the $199 price that Amazon's going to charge for the Kindle file going to become a benchmark, though?"
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640]   I mean, isn't it going to influence everybody?
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.640]   Yes.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.640]   That's a big deal.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.640]   That's the most important part of that announcement.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   I know I said it earlier, but I'll say it again.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.640]   That will drive everyone else except Apple to compete on the price point.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   And I wouldn't be shocked if Apple puts out a larger iPod touch that could be perceived as competition.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.640]   That's got to be the benchmark.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.640]   That could be the special new product.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:36.640]   I'm not buying that one. I'm out on that. I'm against it.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   We bought two BlackBerry Playbooks, and we're using them now to pretend they're Amazon.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.640]   What, one for each foot?
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.640]   We're using them now to pretend that we have a fire in stock.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.640]   There is no use for the thing. It's terrible.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   Why did you buy two?
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.640]   I bought one, and Tom bought one.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.640]   Oh.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   We thought, "Oh, it's BlackBerry. How could it be bad?"
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.640]   [laughter]
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   That is Dan Patterson, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:09.640]   You can find him at abcnewsradio.com, @danpatterson on Twitter, and of course on the Google+, where he is very active and Storify, too.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.640]   I'll have to check out that Storify feed.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.640]   You're going to keep posting stuff to that?
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.640]   Yeah. For as long as this story continues, I'll maintain it on Storify.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.640]   You think you might do that again in other stories?
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   I mean, what a great idea.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.640]   Yeah, yeah. I will, absolutely.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.640]   I've known Bert for a while, but this particular story is well made for something like that.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   It's little pieces here and there, and particularly because you may not have access to every single event, but it's something that summarizes, so no one can say this was under-reported.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.640]   And you're using Storify to archive, but you're also posting the same content to Twitter and Google+, right?
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:49.640]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, I see those as distribution points.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   And from what I see, I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, the people who follow on Twitter are very different than the people who follow on Google+.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.640]   So I use them as distribution points, and Storify kind of summarizes it.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.640]   And Google+ really is more about engagement than anything else.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.640]   I follow Twitter for the signal, but I engage on Google+.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   What are you laughing at?
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.640]   I'm not laughing. I'm shaking my head.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.640]   Google+ is listening. What they need is updates via SMS.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:30.640]   I return to Twitter. I would have used + to report from the protest, but because you must use the application and because when there is heavy data use, your phone dies quickly, the best and fastest way to update anything is still Twitter by text message.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.640]   It seems slow and antiquated, but that's the best way to update something when you have very low connectivity.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.640]   That Google+ doesn't have it means they didn't use Google+ to report from this event live.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.640]   Well, it's pretty exciting because I believe 33669 is the SMS number for Google+.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   Oh, is it? Do they have SMS?
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.640]   Why isn't this in my case when I'm there?
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   You know how I found out about it? I would never have known, but Mike Elgin wrote an article on how to email posts to Google+ and that's his workaround is you email to SMS and then it will go to Google+.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   And for reasons I'm not sure I understand, I remember that the number is 33669.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   Yeah, this needs to be in my face. I need to know about this. If I don't know about it...
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   33669!
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.640]   [laughter]
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.640]   Anyway, I'm glad I could help you out there.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:21.640]   Well, thank you.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.640]   [laughter]
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   John C. Dvorak, ChannelDvorak.com.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.640]   Yeah, also Dvorak.org/blog. I've done a redesign which is not finished.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.640]   No, wait a minute. Let's go see that.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   I'm still working on it.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.640]   Well, do you have a under construction...
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.640]   Yeah, a guy digging a hole.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.640]   Digging a hole. Oh, God, I love those animated GIFs.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:42.640]   Yeah, I don't have them.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.640]   No?
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   So, that...
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.640]   Oh, I see what you did. You took all the ads off.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.640]   No agenda showed. Yes, I'm taking the ads off my blog.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.640]   Really?
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.640]   He's going all donations.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.640]   There are no ads on here.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   Yeah, I'm not...
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.640]   There used to be a crap load of ads on your blog.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.640]   Yeah, but they stopped paying off some time ago and I said screw it.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.640]   Good for you. So that's the redesign?
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.640]   No.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:02.640]   Oh.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.640]   That's the redesign.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.640]   And, of course, the No Agenda Show which everybody...
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.640]   Noagendashow.com.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.640]   ...must listen to in the morning.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.640]   In the morning.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.640]   That's a provocative graphic.
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.640]   No, that's Obama on top of a predator.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   Oh, yeah. He's like the guy in Doctor Strange's love.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.640]   He's Obama people.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.640]   He's like, "Yeah."
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   He's like, "You speak."
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:28.640]   Mr. Patrick Norton, my old pal from the screensavers, is still working hard on Twitch this week in computer hardware.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:29.640]   Yes, I am.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.640]   That is every... What, it's Thursday, right?
