[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.200]   Yeah, we started about 10 minutes ago.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.160]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   Maybe it's your fault.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.640]   Oh, Dr. is back in town.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   What I'm here, we burn this place down, new building, new fires.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.040]   Dumpyhippo.com.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   What is the name of your site?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.680]   Exactly.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.280]   No, it's not.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.640]   What is it?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   It's on the screen, Hippo Ninja.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.760]   Hippo Ninja.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.240]   That's right.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.840]   And what is this?
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.440]   NYC, that's New York.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.360]   Yep.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   And 19 spades.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   And I love--
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.400]   So that's black for Sean John, 1969 as when he was born.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   Oh, I get it.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.280]   Yep, New York.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.920]   Sean John.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.520]   Sean John.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.280]   Pho Boo.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.080]   Puff Daddy.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.320]   For us, buy us.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.760]   That's right.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160]   I want to do a new label, Four Geeks Buy Geeks.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.840]   Pho Goog.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.080]   I'll buy it.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.640]   Would you buy it?
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.080]   I would buy it.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.800]   Four Geeks.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.600]   Everything would be XXXL.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   Just make tents.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.360]   You get to share this.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.040]   OK, this is the ugly side of the table.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.000]   Let's take a look at the attractive side of the table,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.560]   joining us right now from techcrunch.com.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.320]   Alexia Tsozis, it's great to have you.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.120]   Finally, for all this time--
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.040]   Very nice to meet you.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.960]   --welcome to the show.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.160]   I haven't met you.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.920]   Please to meet you.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.640]   Thank you, too.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   Thank you very much for being here.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   Sitting to her left, Jolie Odell, formerly of Mashable.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.800]   Now at Venture Beat, congratulations on the new gig.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240]   It's great to have you both.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.200]   And you know what the deal is.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   We talk about the week's tech news,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   interspersed with profit-making commercials.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   I think a doctor is beautiful.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   Exactly.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.760]   I don't think he's ugly.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.280]   Oh, I'm going to have luck for a year.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.560]   I can't eat a lany ticket.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.520]   And a rabbit's foot.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.320]   I'm good.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.040]   Hey, he shaved your head just for the show today.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   I did.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.120]   I keep his mouth for you, Uncle Leo.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.960]   Alexia drove up, and I understand that she was
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.840]   reading you the stories so you know
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.040]   what we were talking about today.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.080]   Because I don't know how to read.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.840]   Well, you're driving.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.360]   You don't know how to read and drive it.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800]   Was there a story that grabbed your attention
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.080]   that we should start with?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.920]   We were reading M.G.'s post with Google.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.120]   There will be bad blood.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   And then we were reading--
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.440]   hold on, we were reading the poker game one, which--
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.640]   Well, let's start with Google.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.160]   The novel.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   Let's start with Google.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.560]   There will be bad blood.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.840]   I guess that's what we were talking about.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120]   We were talking about evil.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.520]   Well, we were talking about how--
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.400]   I mean, we were reading the poker stakes one,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.360]   about the patent auction--
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.800]   So Google lost the North tell patents to Microsoft and Apple.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.440]   And they didn't seem to be very aggressively bidding.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.320]   They were bidding pie and other weird numbers, right?
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.480]   I mean, that's a matter of debate.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.760]   When pies in the millions and billions--
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.120]   Yeah, it was not really a war of billion dollars.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.320]   It was a serious movie.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   You're bidding billions.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.880]   It's cute that it's pie, but it's still serious money.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.840]   And then the Google Council did a blog post.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.760]   David Drummond.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   Saying--
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.080]   Saying we--
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.400]   Saying that these companies are banding together
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.000]   in an anti-android stance.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.280]   That essentially they want--
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.720]   They want to litigate, not innovate.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.200]   Yes.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   And they want to pass on charge to consumers.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.000]   So essentially you're paying Microsoft--
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   People like Samsung are paying Microsoft stuff, like 15 bucks.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.160]   It's-- we don't know.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.480]   But it's thought that they're making as much as $15 a phone
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.640]   when you buy an Android phone from these companies.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   They're licensing Linux from Microsoft.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.240]   So it's like these companies are starting a kind of anti-innovation,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360]   anti-android cabal.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.680]   And then Microsoft, Frank Shaw, came back at them
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.840]   with a tweet saying, but yeah, you guys
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.480]   were-- we gave you the opportunity
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.280]   to be in on the Nobel patent.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.600]   Yeah, see, that's the difference.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   Well, then they went and they bought a bunch of IBM patents
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.600]   like the week before.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.320]   So everybody is-- what's really happening
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   is everybody's patenting up, right?
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.920]   And if they're trying to say otherwise,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   it's a complete PR war of words that
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.440]   means nothing to the reality of the situation.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.760]   But doesn't Google have to do that to defend themselves?
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.240]   I mean, maybe they don't believe in litigating.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.360]   If you talk to a patent lawyer, yeah, they do.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.480]   But in Google's not litigating at this point,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.040]   they're just getting patents.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.480]   So they can counter sue when they're
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.920]   confronted with more patent litigation than they're--
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.800]   As defense.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.680]   Right.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.280]   So what Google-- I don't think it's inconsistent if Drummond says,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.680]   well, we wish people would just not sue us.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.440]   Well, that's not the way the world works.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.800]   It's like, don't-- but if you're going to draw a gun on me,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.280]   I better have a gun.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.720]   Will we keep hearing earlier?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.800]   Well, that's not what gun we listen to.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   Neutral annihilation.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.880]   Like, everybody dies.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.380]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.000]   You think Google should practice passive nonviolence?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.560]   No.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.080]   I'm just saying they're trying to keep on themselves.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.520]   They should lie down on the--
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   They should lie down on the--
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.600]   That's why they lost.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.440]   That's why they lost.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.880]   They were too passive.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   It's a bad situation to be in, because even the whole teaming
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.880]   up of companies, with Sony teaming up with Apple
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.680]   and stuff like that, all these smaller companies
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.480]   come together as one, I'm like, Sony, if you didn't have Android,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.520]   you wouldn't sell any handsets.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.680]   Sony would not sell one single phone right now
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.720]   if it wasn't for Android.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.960]   And even their Android phones suck.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   I'm sorry, Sony.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   I love most of your products, but your phones are garbage.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.920]   The Xperia.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.360]   Yeah, they try to put their own thing on top of Android.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.760]   And then you want to go and try and work with Apple,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.440]   because Apple's never going to do anything for you.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.280]   But I agree with Drummond when he says,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.040]   the problem is that these companies who
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.560]   are getting steam roller by are superior product,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.120]   instead of innovating--
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.880]   Instead of competing on a product level.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.680]   --are suing.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.360]   Microsoft is involved in their trying
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.800]   to compete on a product level.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560]   And failing miserably, by the way.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.320]   I think they're the best job.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   The numbers.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   They're not selling well, but the phones look good.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.160]   And it's pretty--
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.360]   They're not selling well as a pretty great phone well.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.960]   They're not selling well.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   I'd rather have a selling--
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.760]   What are the time?
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.280]   What are the time?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.120]   This is going to be great.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.640]   I'd rather have something that looked horrible,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.720]   that sold hand over fist, and something
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.200]   that looks good and nobody wants to buy.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.760]   I don't think anybody disagrees that Windows Phone 7 is actually
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.680]   aesthetically superior to Android, right?
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.200]   It is.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.360]   It's not as functional.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.640]   Maybe they need more marketing.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.600]   Maybe they need a bigger push.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   Maybe they can give everyone a phone for free.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.280]   I think they did a pretty damn good marketing push.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.240]   And I just think people were happy with the phones they had.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.400]   I think the race was over when they entered the race.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.240]   Unfortunately, yeah.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   They can't be happy with the phone.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.680]   They have because Android keeps on phones hand over fist.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.200]   People are trading in phones left and right
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.440]   to get new phones and upgrading phones.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.640]   The numbers are skyrocketing.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.960]   So the market is available out there to them.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.280]   So their marketing can't be that great.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.600]   If they can't be pulling in, the numbers that Android is
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.560]   growing in.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   Android is doubling triple.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.920]   They're people buying these phones.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.880]   Isn't Android most popular among first-time smartphone owners?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.880]   That's from the marketing of Microsoft.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.320]   Now, I'm recalling a hazy version of the statistic
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.880]   from a while ago.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.480]   But I do recall writing, actually, about this.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.320]   That people who had bought smartphones within the past six
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.240]   months are reconsidering buying smartphones for the first time
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.720]   were looking toward Android.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.120]   Is that because of all the ads Motorola did for Droid?
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.840]   No, I think it's because it's available on more networks.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.280]   And they have to use the phone.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.880]   And they're really effing cheap, too.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.640]   Like you could walk in and have a new contract
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   and get an Android phone for $90.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   But I'm going to guess.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.760]   Let me just to make a wild guess.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.920]   iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.680]   Android.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.160]   Android.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.080]   Android.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.600]   iPhone.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.440]   You see what kind of computer she's rocking.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.160]   You know what she's doing.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   She's using an HP Windows 7.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.120]   She's like--
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.760]   What I admire about She'll lose that she hasn't joined.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   The Apple cult.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.360]   I refuse.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.840]   She's like, every time people start talking about Apple,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.320]   I put headphones on.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.800]   I actually--
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.320]   I am.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   I have far preferred--
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160]   I have a full armor on.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.200]   And everybody watching in the home knows I far prefer Android
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.160]   to the iPhone and I carry an Android phone as well.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   Let's put it this way.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   The Sony makes a air-like laptop.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.840]   It's lighter than this.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.720]   It is sexy.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.640]   It comes with a--
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   But it runs Windows.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.200]   Besides that, I'm just talking about the aesthetics
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   I would weigh--
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.320]   That's an issue.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.920]   The way it feels.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920]   No, forget the operating system.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.440]   Just the way it feels.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.200]   Because you know Apple makes things that are pretty, right?
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.560]   But I'm running Windows on this air.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   So I could do this.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.640]   And it was easy for I come and take that picture from you.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.240]   I'm trying to tell you something.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.760]   You want my Dr. Evil chair, really?
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.720]   Sony makes a really nice, thin, light, beautiful laptop.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.560]   And it's awesome.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.000]   The problem is, is that it costs $3,000.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.080]   And I'm like, it looks so sexy.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.400]   And that's what everybody buys out for.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.680]   Because Apple does pretty.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.760]   And this is pretty, but it's three.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.400]   And I'm like, I can buy two of these for three years.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.680]   You know what?
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   We're going to have a test of your theory.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.120]   Because Intel has announced these ultra-mobile PCs
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.320]   that will run less than $1,000 that
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.520]   look just like a MacBook Air.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.480]   This is coming in early 2012, or maybe late 2011.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   So this will be a test.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.840]   I don't think they're going to outsell these.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.840]   But I'll buy two of them and give you one.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.520]   Well, that's because people attach so much
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   in motion to the glass and plastic and ones and zeros
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.200]   behind hardware to the point that it doesn't have anything
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.440]   to do with the hardware itself.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.600]   You know, Apple people are not going to buy that product.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.720]   Can I say something that's in motion based?
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.600]   If I had known that you were going to be sensible,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.680]   I would never have invited you to this product.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.640]   I know you could.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.560]   You're absolutely right.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.680]   Of course, you're right.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.520]   It's a religious war.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.560]   I would buy that Sony laptop if it didn't cost $3,000.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.720]   I just want something light.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.600]   This is going to be the test.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.120]   We'll see when--
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.000]   I have an Mac and PC at home.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   I'm just like when I travel--
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.640]   We'll see when it's up.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.800]   This ultra-like is the lightest.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   Would you buy the Intel Ultra-book?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.960]   I wouldn't even consider it.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.320]   I'd rather pay $300 more or something like that.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, that's different.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.480]   It's adorable.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.360]   That's not even useful.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.560]   That's beautiful.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.200]   $710.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.920]   What are MacBook Airs at this point?
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.640]   $999.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.600]   OK.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.680]   What's $300?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.160]   I mean, it's a lot of money, sure.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.200]   But--
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.480]   What's money?
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.760]   We have to support America.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.640]   Yeah, with children, man.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.080]   To get back to the phones.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   Do you think that's why they buy Android?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.040]   Because it's cheaper?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   For a lot of people, yeah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.400]   Or because you're a two-mobiler or a sprint user
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.560]   and you don't have a choice.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.320]   Windows is just as cheap as, again, that marketing thing
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.920]   and the bad taste in the mouth.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.680]   I had Windows smartphones forever.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.360]   I've got a phone that's this tall, that wide at home,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.760]   that still runs and runs Windows.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   But I would never buy another Windows phone
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.280]   because of that experience from moving to new smartphones.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.400]   So Microsoft has a bad marketing.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.960]   They haven't gotten in people's brains.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.480]   This is awesome.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.920]   Because when you pick one of those phones up,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.720]   I'm like, this is sexy.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.880]   I'm not giving them my iPhone for it,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.440]   but I picked that over Android.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   But they're not getting that across to the masses.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.400]   To underscore what Jolie O'Dell said, this--
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   This is like politics now.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.920]   It's like red states and blue states.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.560]   Although Android is the yellow, state iOS is the blue state.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.480]   Gray is blackberry.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.400]   No, gray is they don't have phones in that state.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.560]   It's North and South Dakota.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.040]   Oregon.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.160]   New York, which is interesting.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.720]   I think New York probably is blackberry
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.760]   because it's government and big business dominated.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   It's girls with nails.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.040]   It's because they're actually a government and they're blackberry.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   When I worked in a modeling agency, I went to blackberry.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   Yeah, it's girls with nails.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.840]   You can't type this out.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.640]   A keyboard?
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.360]   Dang.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.920]   What?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   Girls.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.880]   Every woman I know in New York won't touch a smartphone.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.000]   They're like, look, I can't click into the phone.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.760]   I have nails.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.720]   I have my phone.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.920]   I just said, no, geez.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.200]   We're on the West Coast right now.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.240]   I said, hold nails.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:01.960]   Learn our feast.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   I'm just telling you.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.240]   Look.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.840]   This is the girls with nails theory.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.240]   Let's vote this out.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   Somebody back me up.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.160]   I'll grow nails and I'll show you how hard
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.480]   it is to type on this iPhone.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.400]   So I'm very surprised how successful Android is.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.600]   And yes, it's like a cumulative across all the OEMs.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.360]   But 40% of the market, according to COM score,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.800]   with Apple at 26%.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.960]   Can I note one thing?
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.200]   You know, boring patents are.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.800]   We talked about patents for 30 seconds
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.560]   and just went on--
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.000]   OK, do you want to do anything about patents?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.480]   No.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.520]   OK, let's get back to that.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.040]   You know what, though?
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.200]   Before the show began, we were talking about evil
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   in this context.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.360]   And I think this actually is an interesting topic
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.400]   because the issue was that Google is evil.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.200]   No.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.160]   Yes, you said so.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.440]   It's a corporation.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.560]   No, I said it's a corporation.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.440]   You said it's a moral.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.480]   It's a moral, which is not evil.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.520]   My problem with Google right now is they're doing this whole--
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.880]   all these poor people doing the Android platform
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.760]   are getting persecuted by these big, bad corporations
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.680]   and their big, bad patent lawsuits.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.840]   Hey, IBM, can we have some of those patents things?
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.800]   Yeah, this sucks.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.760]   Patent law is stupid.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.200]   That's a good point.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.160]   It's a little ridiculous for a corporate lawyer to say,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.680]   oh, they're bad because they're suing us.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   They're only bad because they're suing Google.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.040]   And when Google has the power to countersue,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.480]   I think that we'll see a lot of this rhetoric go down the toilet.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:18.960]   Right.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.720]   You won't hear anything about it once they have patents.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   Exactly.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.920]   It'll be back where patent law belongs off the blogs.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.720]   So do we agree that software patents are the real problem?
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.220]   Here?
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.200]   Or is it corporate behavior that's the real problem?
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.360]   Corporate behavior surrounding software patents.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.860]   Together.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.280]   It's a--
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.720]   It's an evil nexus.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.600]   It's the evil act-- the axis of evil.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.960]   Well, it's like everyone has to roll around in this patent
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   mud because the system's so broken.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.200]   Because you have to.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.320]   Because we have no other alternative.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.920]   You cannot not participate.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.960]   It's going to work itself out.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   We shouldn't be talking about it.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.600]   If Microsoft wasn't tweeting that Google was trying
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.240]   to screw them on deals, then it wouldn't even matter.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.320]   Well, I mean, money's going to change hands.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.560]   And it's all going to be water under the bridge
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.920]   in a matter of weeks and months.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.360]   Then don't you ever wonder, OK, so when it comes to Oracle
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.080]   and Google, how do patents on something like Java,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.920]   where it's supposed to be open source software?
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   And Android is too.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   Look at this.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.880]   That's another huge lawsuit.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.160]   Open source of--
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   Oh, boy.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.880]   Sun and-- well, I guess Oracle now.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.320]   And Java--
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.240]   Here's the funny thing.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.720]   I don't think we would have seen the lawsuit if Oracle
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.160]   hadn't bought Sun.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.000]   No, of course not.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   No.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.680]   In fact, some may make the case that that's why Oracle
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   is saying that.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.280]   Yeah, I just said that.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.560]   Ooh, we can sue Google now.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.400]   We've been waiting for that.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   I am thrilled.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.000]   This is a great panel.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.920]   I'm so glad we brought you all the way up here
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.240]   from San Francisco, Alexia.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.080]   So it's this of techcrunch.com, Jolie Odell.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.560]   Now, adventurebeat.com.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.360]   Great to have you.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.000]   Congratulations once again.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.520]   Oh, Doctor, who is of jumbo hippo place.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.760]   What is that?
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.360]   No, I like you saying goofy things.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.040]   You keep making up stuff.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.000]   Hippo ninja.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.240]   It says on screen, people can read.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.680]   But the last time--
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.760]   but some people listen in audio.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.960]   In fact, a lot of people--
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.920]   But they can guesstimate what you're trying to say.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.520]   Hippo ninja.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.440]   What is-- I'm just looking.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.200]   I'm going to look it up.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.720]   Hippo ninja, what do I get when I get here?
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.640]   I made a new social network.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.480]   We're nothing.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.000]   I got people--
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.720]   I get-- give me your email address.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.160]   Listen, listen.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.200]   I got to give you emails.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   Do we have gems?
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.600]   Look, it's a cute hippo.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.560]   That is a cute hippo.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.200]   That is definitely a value add.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   And you know what?
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.320]   They're going to be my prime source subjects when I launch.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   You promise you're not going to sell my email address
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.840]   if I sell it.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.240]   I might sell your email address.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.040]   I will sell their email address.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.280]   I promise I will not sell anyone's email address except for Leo's.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.720]   I get it.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.280]   It's a ninja hippo.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.000]   Yes.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.720]   The most deadly-- what's the most deadly animal on the planet?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.240]   The hippo.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   Yes.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.600]   You know what?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.480]   It's even deadlier.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.960]   A ninja hippo.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.200]   You know, actually, it's shark week right now.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.120]   And people often think-- do you guys
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.840]   watch-- you're watching all the sharks shark too.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.240]   People often think that sharks are bad.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.720]   They're evil.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.280]   They're deadly.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.480]   In fact, we're much more dangerous to sharks
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.520]   than they are to us.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.560]   Only five people a year die for sharks.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.960]   Here's a list put together by the website DamCool--
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.240]   what is it?
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.800]   DamCoolPictures.com-- things that kill more people than sharks.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.880]   obesity, gum.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.200]   Obesity, number one.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.760]   Crack.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.000]   30,000 people die every year.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.480]   Remember, five people die for sharks.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:17.840]   Actually, that's--
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.680]   100,000 people--
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   That's 29,999.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.680]   I didn't die last year.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.840]   You lost 15 pounds, dude.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.400]   I'm proud of you.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.880]   You're going.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.380]   Good.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.000]   I want to see the Skinny-O doctor.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Look, you know.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.480]   Texting, texting.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:27.840]   Look at--
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.480]   Look at the light, my killing, texting.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.240]   Texting, texting, hippos.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.640]   Hippos, that's from Total Love.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.840]   They're going to go hippos.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.960]   You see a shark week come at me.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.720]   Hippos, we need--
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   Dangerous.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.000]   We're going to see--
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.920]   That's all you need to know.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.720]   And are we going to see--
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.960]   There's a discovery due hippo week.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.880]   You don't want to know what the coolest hippos are?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.440]   What?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.960]   The cocaine hippos down in South America.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.680]   I do not want to see a coked up hippo.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.800]   No, it's not coked up.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   They're owned by a coked rug lord.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.760]   And they--
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.980]   He brought in hippos.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.980]   He needs some coke.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.460]   Yes.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.380]   Oh, that's so mean.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.020]   Just Google cocaine hippos now.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.740]   Yes, just Google.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.660]   He'll feed them.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.420]   Look at this.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.700]   More people die falling out of bed
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.940]   than die from sharks.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.540]   450 people a year.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.900]   More people die in bathtubs.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.420]   More deer kill people than sharks.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.500]   More deer.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500]   Deer kill 50 times more people than sharks.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   That's been an interesting deer.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.900]   Icicles in Russia.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.540]   Hot dogs kill 70 kids every year.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.660]   Hot dogs kill 70 kids.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.160]   They choke on them.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   What?
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.160]   Tornadoes.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.520]   Jellyfish.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.720]   Dogs kill more people than sharks.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.520]   What's the bottom?
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.360]   It's--
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.280]   I don't believe that.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.600]   High school football kills more--
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.200]   this is vending machines kill 13 people annually.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.320]   I would love vending machines to kill more people.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.080]   This is why people don't like me on Twitter.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.720]   Every time I come on here, we get on some obscure--
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.320]   It's mostly--
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.000]   List all shark week and cooking.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.480]   It's mostly people who didn't--
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.000]   the vending machine didn't give them what they paid for.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.080]   And they start kicking it, and they pull it over
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.680]   on top of themselves, and it kills them.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   Wow.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   So don't do that, kids.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.080]   Well, somebody should anchor them to the wall,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.160]   like they're supposed to be.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.680]   But--
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.200]   So sharks are getting a bad rap.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.520]   Five people, and that's nothing.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.240]   That's nothing.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.840]   That's nothing.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   Hippos kill lots more.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.880]   That's right.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.960]   It's almost 3,000 people.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.480]   And a ninja hippo is a kill so many.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.160]   You don't even know because they're ninjas.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.800]   They're in and out.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.280]   Oh, doctor.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.160]   Don't know what they do.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   Dangerous.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.320]   We're going to take a break.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.280]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.400]   This can only get worse.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Stay tuned.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.320]   Caught can hippos.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   Caught can hippos.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:21.840]   Go ahead.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.340]   Please.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.840]   You might guess.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.160]   I'm doing it.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.320]   Google cocaine hippos.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.840]   And while you're doing that, everybody else,

[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.320]   And I got to tell you, when they launched this,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.040]   they showed it to us about a month ago.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.160]   I was blown away at the quality, the clear, crisp, high
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.000]   res video that you can now do on go to meeting.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.560]   Now, you've seen go to meeting before.

[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.920]   If you get a VoIP line, you get a conference line.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.000]   You also get, of course, screen sharing.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.560]   But now, you see people's faces.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.240]   And I got to say, the quality of this--
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.440]   and everybody's got a webcam on their computer now.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.360]   We did a meeting with six people.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.480]   And it's incredible because you're
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.360]   seeing their faces.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   You're seeing their reactions.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   If you're making a sales pitch, you see your client.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.920]   You see his body language.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.200]   And he sees yours, too.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.760]   And frankly, that's how you sell.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.320]   It's face to face.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.800]   Go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.120]   It's really remarkable.

[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.040]   Very easy to set up that next presentation.

[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.280]   Mind boggling!
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.680]   I think it's funny that Alexia was your audible.com
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.480]   going coming up to you.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.160]   She was amazing.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   We were trying to figure out how we could clone her.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.320]   I think we were trying to come up with a startup model.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.720]   We could get fun and release.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Alexia in your car.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.840]   I was just going to chain her to the steering wheel
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.800]   and I'll let her leave.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.320]   Do you mind if I reach you?
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   She's like, only if you mind me chaining you to the car.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.400]   Well, it's nice once you get somebody reading to you,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.560]   you don't have to do anything.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.060]   I know.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.960]   I don't have to click pause.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   I'll talk it.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   That's why I use audible.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.000]   It's great.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.640]   It's amazing.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.440]   Gosh, Internet Explo-- did any of you
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.920]   fall for this Internet Explorer story, the one that
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.520]   said IE users have lower IQs?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.040]   So did Venture Beat write about this?
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.960]   Sweet, didn't I?
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.840]   I can't recall.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.040]   I don't mean Venture Beat.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.560]   I don't mean Venture Beat.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.640]   I'm proud to say that this story came out
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   before we did Twit last week.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.680]   I wasn't so much that I looked into it.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.920]   I researched it and I saw that it was patent nonsense.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.080]   It was that I don't like survey results anyway.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.480]   But you know who fell for this?
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.040]   BBC fell for it.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.440]   CNN fell for it.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:56.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.840]   It's one of those-- this technology versus that technology
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   and let's have an emotional war that doesn't actually
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.360]   mean anything.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.400]   It's a good headline.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:03.880]   It's stupid.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.560]   It's a good headline.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.640]   It said that this guy-- he thanked the whole thing.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.080]   He claimed that he gave IQ tests to 100,000 browser users
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.840]   and that people used internet explorer almost universally
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.480]   had lower IQs.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.360]   I reinforced what we all know instinctually, right?
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.920]   You know, that's why everyone fell for it.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.880]   That's why everyone fell for it.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.760]   It was believable.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.560]   It was believable.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.360]   You're like, OK, cool.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.280]   Finally, we've got like actionable data
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   on how internet explorer users are stupid.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.160]   I don't know that it's instinctual.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.280]   I think it supports some stereotypes and prejudices
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.840]   that exist.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.400]   But I certainly--
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.760]   Says the Windows user.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.200]   Says the damn Windows user.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.360]   What are stereotypes?
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   I mean, they're just patterns.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:43.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.040]   Alexia, you're not asserting that it's actually possible.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.800]   No, not at all.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.320]   Yes, you are.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.760]   She's laughing.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.640]   No, I mean-- well, OK, you're right.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   OK, I'm going to confess.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.360]   Most people have to go.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.880]   I'm going to confess.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   It is somewhat believable because those are the people
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.480]   who just used what the computer came with.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.360]   They weren't questing enough to see if there was an alternative.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   It doesn't make them stupid that they
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.560]   care about things other than the internet.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   Pass it.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.240]   Pass it.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.640]   And what is the definition of intelligence?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.840]   I mean, as someone who's curious, active,
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.320]   goes deep in a subject.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.880]   She's a plastic.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.400]   She's a human.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.000]   Who has to care about a browser?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.320]   I don't think you have to care about your browser
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.080]   to be intelligent.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   You're right.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.200]   My mom gets outside.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.880]   She's very smart.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.680]   And I think she uses it as smart.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.480]   I know for fact, Stephen Hawking
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.040]   uses internet explorer, OK?
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.960]   I mean, there's an outlier than this a lot.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.320]   Say, it's survey said.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.160]   I read it on the internet.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.760]   It must be true.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.640]   The real question is, why did everyone fall for this?
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   I mean, it was--
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   it's like, that was an IQ test for bloggers.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.480]   That's what he said.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.280]   Did he want to call the guy who did this said he said this
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.080]   was an IQ test?
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   Did anyone call head?
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.280]   I think the next web did, probably.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.520]   If you followed it up, and if you go to the site,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.400]   it's at APTI-APDI-QANT.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.240]   Let me see if Intrabit covered this.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.560]   We have rules about getting in touch with the sources
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.680]   of news these days.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.280]   If you had had rules like that,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.480]   if the traditional journalistic rules are deployed,
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.320]   it would have not probably happened.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.040]   And the problem, too, is in this world, everything's viral.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   So if someone sees it, they want to post it
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.320]   because all the people are posting it.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.440]   So they piggyback off each other, like, oh, somebody else
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.400]   wrote about it, it must be true.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.280]   And then next thing you know, everybody's pulling retractions.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.480]   This is the site that posted it has on its own site,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.120]   10 or 8 telltale signs that this was a hoax
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.320]   that you should have uncovered.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.120]   The domain was registered--
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.680]   A month ago.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.000]   A month ago.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.320]   The test mentioned a test that is copyrighted
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.720]   and can't be given online.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.520]   The phone number, if you tried to call it,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.760]   and the press release refers back
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.720]   to the phone number of his other websites.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.080]   I don't know if that's going to work.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.920]   The address doesn't exist.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.800]   All the material was-- he stole stuff,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.040]   including images from another site.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.200]   Now this one, I think you probably
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.640]   might take exception to, Alexia.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.240]   He says, the website is made in WordPress.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.280]   Come on now.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.080]   I think TechCrunch also is made in WordPress.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.920]   I made--
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.280]   So is Venturebeat.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.160]   And so is Venturebeat.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.080]   And so is my blog.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.200]   It's been made on Blogger or so.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.880]   That would have been a giveaway.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.640]   He said, there were grammatical errors.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.360]   Well, that's not a problem.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.240]   But I think had you called this guy,
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.120]   he might have told you it was a hoax, right?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.640]   He would answer the phone.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.000]   He's going to let that run for a little bit.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.800]   You know, it's very typical, though, of media these days.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.040]   Everybody's in a hurry.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.320]   Very short news cycle.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.800]   It's a great headline.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.320]   And what's the--
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.160]   It's a great story.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.800]   What's the stat?
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.480]   97% of all stats are false or something.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.880]   So I think that's the accurate just.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.480]   Well, I think as media people, we
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.520]   have a responsibility to be gatekeepers.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:47.960]   I agree.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   And that's the kind of crap we need to shut the gate on.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.680]   I agree.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.280]   I agree.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.880]   I mean, things that are hyperbole and overly emotional
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.320]   and that don't enlighten people or clarify
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.400]   a murky situation, we can say, OK, this is stupid.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.040]   We're going to let this one pass us by.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.440]   And BBC should have done that.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.040]   It's so-- don't you think-- I mean, you're both.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.480]   You both are bloggers in a very competitive field.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.040]   Don't you think there's an intense pressure when
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   you see a story like this to jump on it?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.920]   In-- you know, there was a hacker news post.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.200]   It's like, don't do stupid shit.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.680]   And that's the way that you get successful.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.960]   It's to stop doing stupid shit.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.880]   Like, stop making--
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.400]   But that's a long-term point of view.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.080]   That doesn't know--
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.520]   Stop making dumb mistakes.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.040]   Right.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.000]   I mean, this is a dumb mistake.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.240]   This is the--
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.040]   Falling for this.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.880]   It's like classic example of the stupid shit
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.040]   that you shouldn't fall for to be good at your job.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.920]   I saw it and I was like, this is probably fake.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.720]   Won't post on it.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.840]   So you immediately said, I don't--
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.720]   It's not an interesting story.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.480]   I mean, first of all, you tend to want
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.400]   to have original source material if you're at the top 1%
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.320]   of your profession or if you're blogging for serious
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.640]   and not just to pass your time.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.600]   Like for serious, man.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.560]   For serious, bro.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.040]   For serious, bro.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.600]   Actually, that's not true because all we ever do
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.840]   is rehash your guys' stories.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.160]   We let you do the reporting.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   And then this is-- but this is opinion, right?
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.880]   So opinion is based on original reporting,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   but not necessarily doing original reporting.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   This is all emotion.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.600]   You can take that take an emotion that
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.480]   shows the lack of enterprise on our part.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   It's a different discipline.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.920]   I think it's different.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.200]   We're commentary.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.720]   Right.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.920]   Well, how can you have an opinion about, you know,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.320]   internet explorer users being stupider than everybody else?
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   What's your angle?
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.440]   Right.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.360]   The angle-- the angle-- ask her what the angle is.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.880]   The angle is-- that's not true.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.280]   Well, the answer is it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.080]   It's completely irrelevant.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.680]   That's a good point.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.280]   It doesn't solve any problems whether or not it's true.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.680]   Most of the things people talk about don't solve problems.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.720]   We just talked about patent law.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.200]   We have nothing really to do with it
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.600]   until the end result comes out.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.560]   I mean, but we talk about it.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:50.920]   We get--
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.440]   Well, we can't--
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.200]   --break a brain about it.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.320]   But I mean, again, emotion comes into it
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.800]   with people who aren't really involved.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.680]   So, you know, some people like Apple or they like Windows.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.880]   And they'll say, you suck.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.320]   And I'm like, really, dude, it's a computer.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.840]   I use it.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.480]   You use it.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.200]   You don't have to dislike me.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.080]   You know, dislike them.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.840]   But people get so crazy about everything.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.880]   We could talk about anything and have an opinion about it.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.040]   This is from the guy who wears NFL football jerseys.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.160]   This is exactly what team sports is all about.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:15.520]   Exactly.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.560]   That's why I'm not a fan.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.280]   I'm not a fanatic.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.480]   I'm not one of those crazy people.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.600]   If the Eagles win, it doesn't make you a better person in any way.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   Actually, it does.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.920]   If the Eagles win, I am happy.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.720]   Ask anyone who's dating me during football season.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.000]   Eagles win, we can talk.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.680]   We can go to dinner.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.480]   I'll take it to the movies.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.200]   They lose.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.320]   We can't talk till Tuesday because it's just
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.480]   going to be two days, 48 hours, and then we can--
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   And you say you're not a fan.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.040]   Is there some stage that you haven't gone to that would make you a fan?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.540]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.240]   I don't make fun of other people or children
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.440]   that like other teams.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.320]   I gave you a different team jersey.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.720]   I wear multiple teams jerseys.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.080]   That's true.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.200]   You know, I'm not a fanatic.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.120]   I should be wearing my Titans jersey right now.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.160]   Next time, I apologize.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.240]   Next time.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.440]   So this is something that will both get you upset and angry.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.080]   And maybe something we can do about--
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.840]   and this is some Jolio Dell's article this week on Venture Beat.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   ISPs, how widespread is this?
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.000]   A UC Berkeley research group said that some internet service
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.800]   providers, when they see a search word,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.760]   will redirect you, instead of to the Google page
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.520]   for that search word, for instance, to the site
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.880]   that you're looking for.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.520]   So if you look for Apple, they'll take it to Apple's site.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   Do they get paid by Apple for that?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.000]   Is it advertising?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.600]   You know, it's affiliate marketing, which has always
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.200]   been to me kind of a little gray.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.280]   But they could make the excuse--
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.080]   well, if you typed Apple in this--
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.760]   Now, Apple would pay somebody at some point.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.040]   But there's such a long chain between the people who
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.200]   are doing this kind of marketing in Apple.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.880]   The company that does this is called Paxfire.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.000]   One of the companies that--
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Well, there's more than one.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.240]   OK, so the thing about these researchers at Berkeley,
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.840]   they completely stumbled upon this.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.440]   They were doing some really esoteric DNS behavior research.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.520]   And they were like, whoa, we're seeing all these weird redirects.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.760]   I wonder what that's all about.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.600]   And so they poked the hornet's nest.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.960]   And they found this collection of ISPs
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.560]   that were working with Paxfire that's doing this.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.120]   And then I got an email from a reader who
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.400]   said that Time Warner is doing the same thing.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.120]   Now, I haven't substantiated that because it's a weekend.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.800]   I'm trying to relax.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.000]   But what's our main thanks for coming here?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.400]   You want to relax?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.040]   So the rationale is that I'm sure the ISPs say, well,
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.320]   if you search for the board blooming dales,
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.920]   you want to go to the blooming dale site.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.360]   So we're doing you a favor.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.880]   You know, when you assume--
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.440]   That's a mistake.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.040]   You get taken to cool.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.400]   And Apple, certainly, you could be thinking about something
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.280]   besides computers.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   You might be thinking about--
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.320]   I could be thinking about apples.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:51.920]   So I mean, I think it's-- and one of the EFF attorneys
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.400]   made the really great point.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.960]   You have certain expectations as a user of how your computer
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.520]   and the internet are supposed to behave.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.240]   And your internet service providers should not
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.080]   change that behavior for money.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.600]   Right.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.160]   Exactly.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.640]   Because the one thing I'm tired of is Facebook knowing
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.480]   that I want to look at women with large breasts
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.440]   at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   Everybody knows that.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   I know.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.880]   I say to people, like, how do they know what I want?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.840]   Did I click that right?
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   Everybody knows that.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   And when certain things you expect like that,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.800]   or like we were talking earlier about Gmail,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.360]   the advertising Gmail, I've never, once in my life,
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   clicked one of those advertisements.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.040]   And I probably never will.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.480]   But they scan my email and they have something very relevant.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.960]   There's something wrong with that.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.520]   No, there's not.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.400]   I'm saying those are--
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.120]   What is something very relevant?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.400]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.960]   That's what you expect to happen, right?
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.320]   I'm using a service for free.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.560]   I use a service for free.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.360]   I expect that to happen.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.400]   And they're very upfront.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.920]   And they're very upfront.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.800]   That's different because--
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.720]   You're paying the ISP.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.640]   I'm paying you.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.200]   So I don't want you coming and telling me
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.560]   what I want to look for when I'm paying for your service
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.080]   to get me in my idea.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.440]   I have to say a salient point about free versus paid.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.480]   If your service is free, you are the product.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.000]   Yes.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.120]   And you just have to resign yourself for that.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.680]   You deal with it.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.520]   Like I said, Facebook, I know what you like, but I like, you know.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.720]   It's a rephrase of--
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.800]   I can't remember who said it.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.760]   If you don't know who the product is, you're the product,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:04.960]   right?
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.040]   If you don't know what they're selling,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.520]   then they're selling you.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   Two advertisers.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.000]   Two advertisers.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And that's a neutral fact of internet.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.880]   But it's double dipping for internet service providers
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.520]   and taking money for a service to also sell you to--
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.020]   Evertime.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.560]   Now, why do you think they need to work with marketing companies
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.360]   to do affiliate marketing when they're already
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.240]   collecting money from--
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.360]   Because there's not enough money in it or a degree.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.120]   Well, raise your prices then, dude.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:28.960]   Get a better business.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   Don't tone a raise your prices.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.880]   Don't screw around with shady internet marketing.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.280]   So this started before with--
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.200]   they used to do this with DNS error traffic.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.000]   So you would type in a website that was wrong.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.320]   And instead of getting a Google or a 404 error
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.200]   that you would normally expect, you'd get one from your internet
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.760]   service provider that would say perhaps you meant.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   And they'd make money on that.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.880]   They'd get clicks and links.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.960]   Don't they still do that?
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.480]   Like, re-rounding--
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.440]   They do.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.400]   To advertising pages.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.840]   But this is more direct than that.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.080]   This is straight up going to the page.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.520]   Going to the page.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   So why is Apple-- this is what I didn't understand about the story.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.880]   Apple's got like $70 billion.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   Why would they do this?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.440]   Why are they doing this?
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.480]   Is Apple doing this, though?
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.280]   I am not clear that Apple or Bloomingdale's or any
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.600]   of the other keyword companies mentioned
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.080]   know that this is happening.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.640]   Then again, I'm not sure that they don't know what's happening.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   How far down that rabbit hole do you want to go?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.320]   Because you could make--
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.680]   I'm sure they're happy it's happening once they find out.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.880]   And if they didn't have anything to do with it, thanks.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.400]   But why?
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.320]   We'll keep paying because you brought someone here.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:37.960]   Regardless.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.160]   At the end of the point, it's cold.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   They don't care.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.680]   Is it a fruitless endeavor to advertise something that isn't
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.040]   actually involved and isn't paying any money to reroute to the site?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.240]   Think of how many times like--
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.560]   What if you went to eBay and bought an Apple computer
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.640]   because the shopping result was right there in the Google
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.600]   search, then Apple loses revenue?
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.000]   So it isn't their best interest, especially when Google is
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.840]   showing shopping results at the very top of the page
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.400]   to get you away from Google as quickly as possible.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.040]   Exactly.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.560]   Especially when you cash in on that result.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.320]   Now, normally, whatever the percentage is,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.440]   people just skip by it.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.160]   But there have been times when I've clicked through something like that.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.360]   I've gone to the wrong page and I stopped.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.520]   I'm like, oh, that's interesting.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.800]   And it happens to be something relevant to what I was looking for.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.120]   It isn't what I wanted, but I stopped to check it out before I went where I wanted.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.320]   Now, if that percentage is 5% of those people they can cash in on,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.440]   that's good money.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.400]   Why not try and do it?
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:24.760]   And go away with it.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.720]   You talked to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.600]   said that Google's been very aggressive about stopping this.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.640]   Well, in Google, I told you they've been very aggressive about it, too,
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.200]   because Google loses when people don't look at their search results.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.240]   And they're ads.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.480]   So I mean, lest we think that Google cares about internet neutrality.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.520]   You're taking money out of their pocket.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   It's taking their money away.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.960]   So again, once again, we see this pattern of Google PR trying to make it out.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.600]   Like they're the white hats when really they just are losing money,
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.040]   because they're not evil enough or something.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.320]   So they're being pushy with the ISPs that are doing this.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.240]   And some users are saying, yeah, this doesn't happen with my Google searches anymore.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.040]   But it happens on Bing and Yahoo, because they're not as aggressive.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   Do we have to be aggressive to do the right thing?
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.480]   Yes.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:09.920]   Yes.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.960]   Absolutely.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.960]   Well, I have to--
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   I have to--
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.560]   This is America.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.320]   Look, I will take $20 on the wheels back and not pay it back if I don't have to.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.160]   I'll tell you that right now, because this is America.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.720]   I brought $20.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.240]   You have $200, dude.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   I said in your car.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   Why are you just saying--
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.040]   I'm just saying I have the money.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.640]   I asked people with money for money.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.440]   Can I have some money?
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.800]   You-- Leo--
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.400]   Talking after-- why are you going to wrap me up?
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.520]   You have to--
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.760]   I mean, you have to play the game because other people are playing.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.240]   I mean, Google learned this the hard way with the North Health patents and the Nobel
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.520]   patents.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.240]   They are-- they want to get into the mobile space.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   The mobile space is rife with litigation.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.520]   If you say we're not sitting this one out, then you'll get competitive--
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.840]   Litigated into the grounds.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.880]   So as soon as you become a corporation in this country, you're compelled at some point
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.520]   to play to do this?
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.440]   Well, it's not necessarily be evil.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.240]   It's not have empathy.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.880]   Or actually think more strategically and think about your bottom line versus thinking emotionally
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   as you were talking about it.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.880]   And that's what Jolie's saying.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.000]   It's a moral because it's not good or bad.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   But it's some point--
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.600]   You're acting in the best fiduciary interests of your stakeholders to maximize profits.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's what a corporation does.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.280]   But at some point with a story like this where you're redirecting search traffic, you kind
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.760]   of have to say, OK, because corporations are amoral, because marketing is intended to
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.640]   make money, we need to have some kind of litigation to make sure that companies like
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.240]   Paxfire can't do this crap to users.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   Why do you make a law?
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   Or you make a law.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   I think that should be a law that you can't redirect search traffic because you feel like
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.360]   it and because you make money from it.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.280]   We've got bigger things to do within the--
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.320]   Well, and we also live in a climate in the US, especially where it's considered wrong
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.960]   for government to interfere with free enterprise.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.360]   This is actually a holy tenet of American democracy.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.520]   They'd rather talk about baseball than internet.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.600]   When enterprise runs rampant and does stupid shit that violates people's expectations
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.880]   and rights even, you have to draw a line somewhere.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.040]   We do have antitrust laws in this country, but maybe we don't go far enough in terms
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   of regulating this kind of--
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.920]   Well, this is just one little thing.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.640]   That seems like the FTC could weigh in on this easily.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.480]   But especially when you get into affiliate marketing, there's some shady crap.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.280]   You can't litigate at all.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   Lots of it.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.960]   This is a precursor of what we're seeing with the net neutrality argument that eventually
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.640]   people who control the pipeline will be able to pull this kind of shit and not get regulated.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   Right.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.800]   And that would be an FCC issue.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   Speaking of--
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.600]   Could I just say the word shit because the ladies keep using it?
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   Yeah, of course.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.080]   I was hoping that this side of the table could be the--
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   We'll stay confident.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   High tone.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   I redact that.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   Quality.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   On this side.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   Tony.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.080]   The potty mouth.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   That's considered over there.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   Tony, edit that out.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.160]   We actually will bloop you if you see those words.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160]   OK.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   The live folks here.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   Feel free to keep saying I felt left out because normally I'm the one custom.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.760]   I think they actually created a drinking game.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.000]   My mother will not be proud.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Mom.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Stop watching Twit Mom.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Mrs. Odell.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Don't watch it live.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Watch it edit.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Edit it.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You're fine.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Tony will take care of it.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Hopefully it all helps.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Did your mom watch this kind of stuff?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   No, she has a life, so.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Did you see that?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   That was Leo.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.680]   That's why mom doesn't do anything on the internet.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   You.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   And then--
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   My mom doesn't do internet stuff.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.840]   Now we're not worried about what brows she uses.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   We know.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   I'm getting kicked off.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   It's OK.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   I'm just going to cry.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   It's OK.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   I don't mind.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   The court-- this is a very interesting court decision that really impacts free speech.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:49.040]   And it's complicated, so I'm going to see if I can explain this.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:55.880]   You remember the ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of the Department of
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:01.680]   Homeland Security, closed down some sites because of copyright violation.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.360]   They actually took the domain name.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.680]   That's how they closed it down.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.840]   The Spanish company Puerto80 lost Roja Directa.com.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:20.080]   And Roja Directa.org, those names no longer redirect to their sites.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.840]   Basically it was a copyright violation asserted by probably American companies, I would guess.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:33.520]   But the court decided-- the Supreme Court-- I think that's the highest court in the land,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   is it not?
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:42.360]   Actually, let me check who this was that did this.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.200]   All this fine print is confusing me.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.920]   Which court was it?
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   The court that decided this, I think it was the Supreme Court, said--
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.080]   It wasn't the Supreme Court.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.400]   It was the New York court.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.000]   It was New York Court of Appeals.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Was that who did it?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   On the Supreme Court.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.280]   Then the Supreme Court has some other issues.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.040]   But the court that ruled this said it is not a violation of their free speech.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.200]   They can simply redirect to another site.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.720]   They can say, no, you could still do that.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.160]   Just buy a new domain name.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.000]   We took your domain name.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.920]   But because you have other ways to publish, we aren't blocking your free speech.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.440]   Now this is where some other Supreme Court decisions get involved.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:32.040]   A 1939 case in which the Supreme Court said, just because you can exercise your free speech
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.960]   elsewhere doesn't mean that anybody has the right to abridge your free speech in one
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   place.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.800]   That's just like going on a march or something and they say, oh, you can say whatever you
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   want to.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   Just go back home and say it.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   In a 1979 case, the US Supreme Court said we are aware of no general principle that
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.120]   freedom of speech may be abridged when the speakers listeners could come by this message
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.720]   by some other means.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:02.400]   However, last year when ICE confiscated a bunch of those domains, everyone was complaining.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.640]   These same entities were complaining, oh no, they just went and set up shop somewhere
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   else.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   How dare they?
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   We told them they were violating copyright or whatever the hell it was at the time.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.720]   Whatever it was at the time, excuse my language.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.640]   The US District Court, Southern District of New York versus Puerto AD.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.840]   Okay, you can do that so that you can say we're not violating your free speech rates.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:28.320]   This is really, yes, this is really a bad decision by a judge who clearly doesn't understand
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.240]   how the internet works, which is not unusual.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.400]   Is there a list of the domains that they took?
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.920]   Yeah, and in fact, this company, yeah, there's a couple of them, but what's funny is this
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.880]   company has in fact created new sites with slightly different domain names, but they
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.480]   have no way of telling their viewers.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   You can't read the record.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.120]   You go to rohuddirecto1.com and you'll be able to watch this.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   It was taken from you.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   You can't read the record.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.320]   And then they just have that big homeland security seal when you go to the original domain.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   Right.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.920]   Not like they're nice enough to do a redirect.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.880]   The judge said rohuddirecto has a large internet presence and can simply distribute
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.320]   information about the seizure and its new domain to its customers.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.200]   What's to say that they won't come after the second domain if they shut the first one
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   down?
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.440]   This is just the silliest.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.400]   Well, I think they're responding to a free speech defense and they're saying, well, no,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.000]   your free speech hasn't been in bridge.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.520]   And the copyright thing is weird as well because it's got discussion forums and rohud
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.120]   erectives saying, but our discussion forums are user generated content, please let--
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   We're not responsible.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.760]   In the same way YouTube is not responsible, right?
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.400]   I would love to see a court say YouTube.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.480]   We're taking the name YouTube.com, but you can always use other tube.com.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.560]   Were they using DMCA's to get rid of the user generated content that was violating
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   copyrights?
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.840]   Maybe they weren't doing the takedowns or something like that.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.040]   But you know the problem is they're not a US company.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   So the rules are different.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   In fact, a Spanish court ruled that what they were doing was not illegal.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.360]   They were not violating copyright.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   It's only the US.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.280]   So how does the US government organization get off taking them off the internet?
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.280]   This is my point.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.440]   They don't have time to regulate marketers taking over my computer while they're still
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   in websites from companies.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   This is what ICE has been too busy.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.440]   They're outside US.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.080]   Yes, they're too busy for that.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.680]   This is what ICE is now doing is that somebody will complain from the movie industry, the
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.880]   record industry, or the television industry.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.600]   ICE will say no problem because in the US we'll just make sure that they don't have
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.920]   that domain name and it doesn't work in the US anymore.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.320]   And when that takes them off the air, problem solved.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.720]   And they're doing it a lot.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.600]   And it's actually very scary.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   And the fact that the court upheld their ability to do that is even more terrifying.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.640]   So they're not taking them off the internet.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   They're actually redirecting them to ICE.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   You get the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.280]   This site is not taking that.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   Go to robot director.com.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.920]   I'm not going there.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.600]   I'm not trying to be tracked by the government.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.200]   I can do it here because I'm using your internet.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.880]   Yeah, use my internet because you don't crash and do the windows.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   God knows.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   They know we're out there.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   That makes for a great show too.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   I know.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   NSA comes knocking.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   Freedom fighting?
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   Let's fight for freedom.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   Do it on Monday when I'm not here.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   Novel idea.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.320]   Worldwide web 20 years old this week.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   Yesterday actually.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.800]   Yeah, we had 802.11 this week.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   What?
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   We had 802.11 this week.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   Oh, that's right.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   August 2nd, 2011.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   And nobody said anything about it.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   I tweeted about it.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   I got maveri tweets.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   Everybody was retweeting it.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.120]   Oh, Doc, it discovered something important.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.760]   It's 802.01.11.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.720]   What's that?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   Is there something in his cup besides water?
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.760]   I wish there were.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:33.200]   I want to talk a little bit about Defcon and Black Hat because the hackers are gathering
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   in Las Vegas.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.720]   We'll find out what's going on there.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   What would you like in your mug?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.080]   Would you like a little whiskey?
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   Sure.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   Actually, no.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   I have to drive someone else home.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.120]   I'm responsible for someone else's life this evening.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.680]   I can drive and you can read to me.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   Okay.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Drunk, I can read to you.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   They are amazing.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   He could drive and we give you whiskey.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   Which would you?
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   You get to fight it out.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.480]   Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about audible.com.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.320]   So you don't really need a Lexi.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   You can have audible read to you everywhere you drive.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   Do you use audible?
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   Oh, one.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   I do.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.880]   Do you really?
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   Go ahead.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.880]   Have a drink.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Relax.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.160]   Do you have a book recommendation you'd like to give us or is there something you'd like
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.400]   you've been listening to lately?
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.680]   The last thing I want to say read.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.080]   The last thing I listened to is a rework from--
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   That's awesome.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   The guy's 37 signals.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   37 signals.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.520]   The thing that always wears me out is like when you know someone, like I've met him a couple
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.200]   of times at conferences and then you hear the person reading it, I almost want the person
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.280]   reading it to be him.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.840]   I wish you actually sounded like this because this guy sounds awesome.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.800]   Sometimes authors aren't always the best readers.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.480]   But so Audible's pretty good about this.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.760]   They know who should read their own books and who shouldn't.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.480]   If you go to Audible.com right now, we're going to give you a chance to get two free
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.120]   audiobooks from Audible.com.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.160]   It's actually go to Audible.com/twit2.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   That's the platinum account.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   You can sign up for that.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.320]   Every month you get two books.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.840]   Of course, the issue is how do we-- what book do we choose?
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.920]   And the thing is there's so many fantastic choices.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.840]   There's a couple of great Google books out right now.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.720]   Of course, Stephen Levy's In The Plex, which is fantastic.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   And Douglas Edwards knew him.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.480]   We just had Douglas on this week in Google on Wednesday.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.240]   He was Google employee number 59.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.880]   He talks about early days of Google.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   Now if you're somebody who wants to know why Google is the way it is and how it got
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.320]   there, these are two excellent books, really a great inside look.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   Gary Vaynerchuk's Thank You Economy is on here.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   That's another great book.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.600]   Now, in this case, Gary reads it because you know what?
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   No one could read.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.800]   Gary's prose except Gary.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.400]   Yeah, it's actually nice that they made Gary to book because Gary--
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.680]   Harper audio presents the Thank You We Con--
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.600]   Listen, if it was going to read something to mind what would be his own book.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   This is the author.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   But I do understand because nobody's going to get hyped like Gary.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   It's true.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   I think Gary Vaynerchuk doesn't read books.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   I don't read books, but I write books.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   Yeah, and then you're like, you want me to read one?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   Read a book.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   How about you read it to me, Gary?
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   I don't have to read books.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   Go Jets.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   So this is just one of many great books.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   Actually, three now I've given you.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600]   Three of many great books.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   Now, those are business, but of course they've got science fiction.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   They've got classics.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   They've got history, mysteries and thrillers.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.600]   Jolie, what's your favorite kind of reading?
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   What do you like to read when you don't have to work?
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   Read for work.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   Us Weekly.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   Wow.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   They do have many--
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   I need to hang out with you on a week.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   Us Weekly.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   We can talk trash about--
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   You like gossip, celebrity gossip.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   You know, I spend so much time reading patent law.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   You don't want to read serious stuff.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   This is how I annoy you.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Don't tell anybody.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.600]   There's actually a lot of great celebrity books on here as well.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   You know, Bossy Pants, Tina Fey's new book is on here.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   What?
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   That's right.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   That's probably awesome.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   There's a lot of great stuff.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   I'm telling you, if you have not tried Audible--
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   and by the way, when you get the platinum account, you will also get a subscription.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   You can get the New York Times read to you.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   You can get the Wall Street Journal read to you that comes with your account.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   So this is a really great deal.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   Your first month is free.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   Your first two books are free.

[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.600]   Cancel it anytime.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   The Secrets of the FBI by Ronald Kessler.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   Now, this sounds kind of interesting.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   Did you know the FBI had secrets?
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   Who knew?
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   I don't want to talk about that.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   We love them.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   I love Audible.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   I'm listening to a great book about Bobby Fischer right now called Endgame that Andy
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   and I co-recommended.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   It's so fantastic.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   You're always just an Audible book, so like--
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   Oh, I live on Audible.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   The two times you gave me a ride, we get in and it's just like, "I'm blown away."
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   It just kicks right into gear.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   This is the one I'm listening to.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   I'm a big chess fan, and this is an amazing book if you're interested in chess.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   Or Bobby Fischer, he was just a wild man.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   I watched that movie and I'm researching for Bobby Fischer.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   They have that too.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.600]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   We thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   So how come nobody went to Defcon or Black Hat?
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   I wanted to go.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   One of our guys here.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   Yeah, Dean Takahashi invented B.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.600]   Yeah, he went to Vegas for Black Hat and Defcon.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   It's funny, Alexia, that you said that because both you and Jolie have independently said
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   you wanted to go.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   I wanted to go.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   He was a big player, CEO, and I think he gave a talk about security.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   I was like, "This is a little bit interesting."
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   There's a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   So one of the things they showed was a couple of hackers showed how they could send a text
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   message to a Subaru Outback.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   I saw that.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   Unlock the car, start the engine, all from a text message.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   I need that.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   I need two of those.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   I think actually that's really interesting that so many cars now are connected, but they
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   actually created a fake GSM, what do they call it, a hot spot, and the car got on it as if
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   it were a real cell phone site and they said, "Hey, car.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   Open up."
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   And they got in and took a ride.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   Now there's two conferences.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   The Black Hat conference is the more serious conference.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   You know, suit and ties, a lot of feds.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   There are a lot of White Hat hackers, and then there's Defcon, which is definitely a little
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   more dark side.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   Shady.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Apparently, according to CBS News, the feds hang around after Black Hat and they go to Defcon
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   to recruit.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   Yeah, they need some skilled players for a team.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   They're recruiting because, yeah, they need players for cyber warfare, basically.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   Remember that spot on Goodwill Hunting, when they're trying to get well to work for NSA,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   and he's like, "Why would I work for the NSA?"
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   And he's like, "Why wouldn't you work for NSA?"
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   So they're out there recruiting.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   They need smart people, young people.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   They're useful to do bad things.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   Here's another unfortunate hack.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   A Black Hat hacker can remotely attack insulin pumps.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   That's a problem.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.600]   Didn't they prove that was a lie?
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   I mean, it wasn't theirs.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   I didn't go in depth into the story because it looked like, like, how do I not curse them?
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   No one's ever--
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   You curse them.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   It looked like BS.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   Do free.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.600]   Yes.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   It looked like BS.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   In most cases-- well, in this case in particular, is there a way to profit from killing a diabetic
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   or wearing an insulin pump?
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   If not, if not, it's probably really a terrorist.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   Do that on mass, though.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   We will kill all the day a bit.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   It's probably require a high level of skill, and there would have to be some opportunity for profit
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   for anybody to get worried about that.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   I think a lot of these hacks are, in fact, unlikely to occur, but it's a--
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   It's one of those fascinating--
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   People love this attack.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   It's like talent show for hackers.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   It is a talent show.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   It's like, do it because I can.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   Look what I can do.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   His presentation was called--
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   That's what he should do.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   Hacking medical devices for fun and insulin.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   It's so good.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   Because there's no profit in it, which is why people haven't done it all.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   By the way, he's a diabetic, does wear an insulin pump.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   I guess that was his interest.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   He's not anti-diabetics.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.600]   He are one.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   It requires an antenna, and a powerful antenna.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   The attacker could be as far as half a mile away.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   So the best thing is you hack something, and then someone hires you to defend what you
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   hacked.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   Well, I think also a lot of times that's what the point is of this is that--
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   It's like a job interview.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   We don't secure these things, right?
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   And we pay no attention to security, and a lot of these hackers are saying, pay attention.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   Pay attention.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.600]   Well, it's like, I feel like this is how they get their jobs.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   It's like they find a security hole in the system, and then the company hires them to
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   fill the security hole.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   Yeah, as long as they don't go to jail for it.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.600]   That guy wants to work for Medtronix.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   Maybe.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   Who wouldn't want to work for Medtronix?
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   It was so funny.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.000]   Once someone got gave a keynote at, I believe it was DEF CON about how we need to pay more
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.480]   attention to security, and we're being way too complacent, especially about national
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.560]   cyber security.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.200]   And some kind of alarm went off in the middle of his talk, and he was like, just ignore
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   that.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   We're going to keep going.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   We're way too complacent.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   It's just a fire and pay no attention.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.000]   Germany's not happy about Facebook.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.600]   Germany's not happy about anything.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   Did they also sue Google?
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   And remember that they call it Blurmany, because they've required the Google Street View allow
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.160]   homeowners to blur the images of their home if they want.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.400]   And do you know what the funny thing is?
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.360]   When you're in Germany, it's like free love, free sex, 60s over there.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.800]   They just do what they want to do.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   Everybody's happy.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   Jeff Jarvis talks about that.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   No, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.600]   You're going to the Love Festival in Berlin, right?
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   No, seriously.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.680]   When I was in Germany, I had my head on a swivel looking for skinheads and crazy white
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.160]   people, and everybody was there was more than happy.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.480]   The age of consent is like low, not that I took that level.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.520]   I'm just letting you know, young people can drink there.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.120]   There's all kinds of things that are just loosey-goosey about, and it's like, oh, well, we don't
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   want Facebook looking at faces.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   It's a company history.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.520]   Or it's the country history.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.080]   You have to think when judging the German problems with privacy.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.080]   You have to consider it.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.440]   You have to consider that they've had...
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.880]   Jeff Jarvis says it's more than that.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.360]   A lot of problems with data.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.640]   In Europe, they don't trust corporations.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.800]   They trust government.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.400]   In the US, we were talking about this earlier, we don't trust government.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.920]   We trust corporations.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.000]   Who's smarter in this case?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.200]   I don't know.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.680]   But the Germans believe that Google or Facebook is going to do something with that facial
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:32.360]   recognition software, and they're suggesting they should be fined up to 300,000 euros.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   If they don't comply.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.480]   They're just trying to fill the bank accounts because they line out too much money in their
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   economy's week.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.880]   So, let's just some money from South America.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   This is hard to go.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.880]   They're rich.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   They can deal with this.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.880]   Let's get some influx of cash.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.880]   It's almost anti-corp.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.840]   It's just kind of an endemic anti-corp-rid sentiment, I think, in all of the EU.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.560]   But it does raise an interesting issue.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.480]   Maybe we should ask Alexia and Jolie, because they're probably more at risk of this.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.560]   But Google did have in their Google goggles capability, they took out the face recognition
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.840]   capability.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   And as they said, it would be dangerous.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.080]   Now, nobody's going to walk down the street and take a picture of a doctor and say, "Oh,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   that's a doctor.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.280]   I'm following them home."
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:14.360]   But I think women are very legitimately concerned about stalkers taking their pictures in tools
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.680]   like this or using Facebook and tools like this to get personal information.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.880]   Isn't that a real concern?
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.400]   I think anybody who's concerned with privacy, Americans, I don't think are as concerned
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   with privacy.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.840]   But if you value your private life remaining private, facial recognition software is a big
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   problem.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.720]   You can't go anywhere without people saying, "Oh, Jolie went to the grocery store and
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.960]   she went to 7-Eleven and here's her house."
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.560]   I take it you don't use four square.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   No, I don't.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]   Let's see.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   I absolutely don't.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   I have a lot lazier.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:47.200]   I think that there's a barrier to entry in someone snapping a picture of me.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.800]   And I'm relatively public.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   Right.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.680]   So I think there's a huge barrier to entry.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.240]   And this might be extremely naive and go ahead and call me out on it.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.080]   But who's going to snap a picture of me and then use facial recognition software to find
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:03.120]   out that this is my Facebook page and like, I don't know, hacking to my Facebook, pretend
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.680]   to be my friend and then find my address and show up.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.040]   Well, you better hope that there is somebody that does that.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.440]   That's the person you really want to worry about.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.040]   And literally it's a fringe case, but the people who would do it are creepers.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   Well, here's the problem.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.600]   The people that are going to do what they're going to do anyway.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.400]   I don't know if you're old, you're long in a tooth.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   You know about peeping tops.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:25.160]   But it would be harder for them to find your online life and your friends and your family.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.880]   It'd be easier to walk down the street and just pick a cute girl and follow her home
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   and I know where she lives at.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.920]   I mean, if a person's going to stalk you, they're going to stalk you and crazy people are going
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   to crazy things.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.360]   But you want to give people, enable them with digital tools to be crazy.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.000]   Again, my point is, is when someone wants to do something, if they're the type of person,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   you can't really stop them.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.400]   Like, when I talk to girls about Facebook or I mean, 4square, I say, "Check in on your
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   way out.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   Don't check in on your way in."
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.640]   And don't check in the same place every day.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.080]   Like, I go to the gym one Tuesday, this is a Starbucks on Wednesday, because that's
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   a stock or a dream.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.480]   I'm like, I'm a chloroformer, 3 o'clock on Wednesdays.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.680]   No, no, I'm staying in general.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.000]   But if you're trying to put yourself out there, you are putting yourself out there.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Well, what's the...
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.520]   On the flip side of this whole thing, what's the benefit for facial recognition software?
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.120]   Oh, I'll tell you, because I'm old.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.120]   Tell me.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   As so, Dr. Hisles.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.120]   Long in the two years.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   Several times now.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.120]   Old man.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   I'm a young woman.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   Old man.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   Leaudra.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   I don't know nothing.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   I don't know about it.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   I don't know about it.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   I'll just keep on chugging along.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   You know, Jolie's an opera singer.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   We shouldn't be missing.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.120]   Oh, sorry.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   I apologize.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.560]   I apologize to everyone who had been here.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   I did not.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   I found this out on your Facebook profile.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   You...
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   Stalker!
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   There you go.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   Okay, that's...
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.560]   That's a block of money.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.480]   The best thing about the internet is that it's people, and the worst thing about the internet
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   is that it's people.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   And it's...
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.840]   I mean, you can give them digital tools, or you can give them actual tools to stock you
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.480]   or kill you or rape you.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   It's the same percentage.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   Or advertise TV.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   I consider that a far more expensive.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   I can't...
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.080]   I cannot talk about it, but I am on the jury trial right now that involves the internet.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.560]   It involves the use of the internet.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.240]   And it's fascinating for a couple of things.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   And I can't...
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.240]   I'm not...
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   You're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.240]   'Til after the trial.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   It's after the show.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   No, not at all.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.000]   Tell me more about this jury trial.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   I will tell you...
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.480]   After the trial, I will tell you all about it.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.600]   But what I found interesting, first of all, was the depth of ignorance.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.320]   That 99% of the people, not just the jurors, but the lawyers, the judge, have about the
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.800]   internet period.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   Just completely.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.520]   What is this Facebook thing you speak of?
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.520]   Amazing.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   But...
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.520]   People do have lives, as she said her mother.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   I know, and I think her mother has a...
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.520]   We live in a bubble.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.360]   We live in a bubble that's...
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.760]   We have a very different perception of tech.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.960]   I didn't use Google Plus so two days ago.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.040]   I would use Google goggles because as an old person, I forget people's names all the
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.040]   time.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.240]   Seriously, wait, hold on, hold on.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   No.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.920]   No, no, but it's only a matter of time before if they allowed Google to do this, if Google
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.480]   weren't afraid of facial recognition that I could have a little camera on my chest or
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.040]   something that would just say, "I have a little earpiece," and you'd think it was a hearing
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   it.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.040]   It's like, "That's Jolie Odell.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.680]   You worked with her in 1999."
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.120]   And it would just tell me, and I would say, "Hi, Jolie.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   How are you?"
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.000]   She's an opera singer.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.360]   "How's the singing going?"
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.840]   And that would be useful to me.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   All right, maybe that's it.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.400]   It would be better just to know fewer people, maybe.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   I'm working on that.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.200]   As we did before the event.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   Hopefully...
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   It's just a shazam for faces.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   That would be very...
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   It's a shazam for faces.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   There you go.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   It'd be like boom.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   Wouldn't they?
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.440]   I'm even a young person with a good memory like that.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.720]   There was a guy yesterday who I've seen 17 times that I don't remember his name.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.720]   You do that one time.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:32.720]   I don't want to actually do it without you.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   That's right.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.720]   Hey, buddy.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   I was like, "What's up?"
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   Someone else, I introduced...
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   Like, I bring up a friend and I'm like, "Oh, me."
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.160]   See, when we have tricks for this stuff...
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   No, exactly.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   The trick is...
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.160]   You introduce the one person you know and you let the other person introduce themselves.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.840]   Or do you say, "Hey, do you two know each other?"
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.360]   And the person says, "Hi, I'm such and such."
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   And you're like, "Oh, yeah, that's your name.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   Leo."
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.320]   And you are and you would be your name.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.040]   The problem is, I see these people all the time I've seen them a hundred times.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.560]   I know I know them and they always just because they work at Starbucks.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.120]   It's always not really that you really care.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   It's just that you...
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   Right?
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.800]   They're not really a person you know or you would know their name.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.920]   Oh, one meets so many people.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   I'm so sorry.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.120]   I meet so many people in my business.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:18.680]   I love this story that Alexia wrote about Facebook now allows you to add your unborn
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:24.560]   baby to your list of family members via a new option called "Expected Child."
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.560]   I'm excited.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.880]   I've got 32 unborn children on this list.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.080]   You know, I'm looking for women to impregnate.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.080]   You know, I got to stop it.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.080]   Oh my God, where did I lose?
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   I need 33 more women.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.080]   Oh my God.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.240]   I need 33 more volunteers and we can start making these babies real.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.840]   Hey, when they say 23 and me, that doesn't mean 23 children.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.320]   Come on, Leo, look, I got unexpected babies.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.960]   I got to fulfill this contract, Leo.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   It's on Facebook.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   It's got to happen.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.600]   This is good business though, isn't it?
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:55.720]   It's the most well-fought-out legion strategy I've seen from an internet company.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.840]   Just tell us about your upcoming Facebook customer.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.280]   It's like doubling.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.760]   They're going to reach that billion, that billion-
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   It's brilliant.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.400]   Parenting a huge business.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.040]   I love watching Mark Zuckerberg because it is true whether you feel he's evil or not.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.400]   And I do actually personally think that he's a little scary.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   Oh my God.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400]   You guys know him.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.760]   He has my Leola part, Mark Zuckerberg's evil.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.920]   I think I can write this right now.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   I think he is evil.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   I think he is evil.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.400]   But I only have a sense of it.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.560]   I don't know him and maybe he's a very nice guy.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.480]   He's definitely very, very smart and remarkably adept at coming up with crap like this, right?
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   Can he come up with that?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   Here's the thing.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Here's what I'm saying.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   You can't blame him.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   He's not.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.760]   If your single Facebook advertises dating sites women with large boobs at 2am, if you
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   are dating, they advertise wedding crap in engagement rings.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.920]   And they can tell that you're expecting that's another billion dollar.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.720]   Can I give you a little insight into what it's like to be me?
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.960]   When I go to Facebook, they offer me Viagra.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.440]   No, here's the thing about the expecting thing.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.000]   That's why I don't use Facebook.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   I have a daughter.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   I have a child.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   I post pictures.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   I tell my friends and family like stuff that we do.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.240]   And they never try to pitch me kid stuff.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.240]   They never try to pitch me any of that.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.760]   Is he added in your family members?
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.240]   I don't have her own Facebook personally.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.640]   No, I mean, in your family, there's a place on Facebook.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.400]   Oh, with the brother sister thingy.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.640]   And I guarantee you, if you said you had a young child, they would be pushing ads.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   Okay.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.880]   Maybe they'll just advertise it to moms because they figured out something.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   I got to point out.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   Maybe that's what they're doing.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.640]   I got to point out, though, that this happens anyway.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.480]   When you go to a hospital and you have a baby, you give them all information.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.840]   I'm still 19 years later getting things about my daughter Abby.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.360]   Like, oh, you're 19 now.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.840]   Perhaps you'd be interested.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.360]   The army just sent Henry, my 16 year old son, a little, would you like some army memorabilia,
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.120]   perhaps a hat or a t-shirt?
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.360]   Because they know.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]   What are these keeping track?
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   Can I show you something?
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   Facebook's just one of--
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.880]   It's the digital equivalent of traditional user acquisition strategy.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.880]   Exactly.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.880]   But it's smart.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.160]   I was engaged and I changed my relationship status to engaged and then changed it back
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.800]   to not engaged when I stopped being engaged.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.040]   And then Facebook rammed me with ads for wedding dresses for six months after that.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.680]   And I thought this is the craziest--
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   That's actually mean.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   It was so cruel.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680]   It was so cruel.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680]   Look at that.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.680]   Uh, CEO at a--
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   That's the angry hippo.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680]   That's your birthday.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680]   What's the date, sir?
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680]   October 17, 1949.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.920]   Yeah, and they don't send me anything about Viagra.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.680]   You're not older than me, dude.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   Yeah, I am.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   Black, don't cry.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.680]   That is the first time I've heard black don't cry.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.680]   Thank you.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680]   Thank you for that image.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680]   Thank you for that image.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.680]   You see this hat, I am shining.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   Over here.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Good to go.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   I thought it'd be interesting to have a diverse panel.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680]   You know you shouldn't have--
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.680]   Diverse two women and a black guy?
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   There's usually never any women, and he doesn't know any of the black people.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680]   That's pretty diverse.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.680]   Don't you think that's diverse?
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   I'm the only black person Leo knows.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   I'm like the black she would have family.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   You're the token Leo.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680]   That's right.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680]   That's black guy on the show.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   I will take it.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   No, there's others.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   I know, there's like two.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   There's Barretun de.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   Yeah, but people-- the best thing about the show is--
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   They think you're Barretun de.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   And they think Barretun de is me all next week.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   They're like, "Barretun de, good to see you on Twitter."
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   And he's like, "That was ODOT, too."
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   The other black guy.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   And I had to do the same thing, he's on, I'm like, "You want to tell me?"
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680]   I wasn't on Twitter.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680]   It's actually--
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.680]   It happens.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.680]   There's only three of us, so take a shot in the dark, which we--
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680]   There's Tristan Walker.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   I can invite Tristan from Four Square.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.680]   Please, I would like to.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.680]   Very intelligent.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680]   I would like to.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.680]   Unlike me.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.680]   So nobody laughed at that because it's not a joke.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.680]   It's true.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   [laughter]
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   No, we're all--
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   So sincere.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680]   We're so sincere.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.680]   We're desperately trying to come up with a one-liner to go along with that.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.680]   Um...
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.680]   Crickets.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.680]   Um...
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.680]   Crickets.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.680]   Robot car accident.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   That's pretty funny.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   A dude was driving it.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   I know, that's even funnier.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   If it had been a robot, it wouldn't have had an accident.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   See, that's one of those human interests.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680]   I don't know, really, from--
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   There's not a text story.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680]   You're saying it's not a text story.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.680]   Of course, it's a text story.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.680]   People crash cars.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680]   I mean, did they--
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   It's just a fender bender.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680]   Jalopnik got the story.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.680]   Well, that makes sense for Jalopnik.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.680]   Yeah, it's a car website.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.680]   Google spokesperson.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.680]   "Google spokesperson.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   Safety is our top priority.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.040]   One of our goals is to prevent fender benders like this one, which occurred while a person
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.680]   was manually driving the car."
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   I'm telling you, Google socks one day.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   One of the goals of our product is to prevent accidents caused by our product.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:22.280]   Actually, the interesting story is it was a pretty bad-- I think the car must have been
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.880]   going pretty fast because he rear-ended another car.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   Three other cars got involved.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   It was a four-car accident.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.680]   Is this in San Francisco the other night?
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   I don't know.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.180]   You ran into some traffic.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.760]   No, there was a guy who was speeding down the street in a Prius ping-ponged off like three
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   or four cars.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.840]   Apparently, he got pulled over for drinking and driving earlier and then ran from the
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   cops.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.740]   Then got away from him, went to another bar of drinking and went out again and hit a whole
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.940]   bunch of cars and got caught.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.040]   That wouldn't have happened if he had a robot driver or a robot drinker.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.080]   You get to take your choice.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.040]   Google's Prius struck another Prius, who was one of these Google auto-driving cars,
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.480]   which then struck a Honda Accord, which then struck another Honda Accord.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.060]   It was like, apparently it doesn't like Honda.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.060]   No, it's Mountain View.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.300]   If you go down there, it's either Prius or Honda Accord.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.540]   You don't have any other choices.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.540]   That's it.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.860]   You won't see any jeeps down there.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.860]   Four-car chain reaction.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.740]   That must have been such a ridiculous situation.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   How does the guy explain?
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.060]   Oh, it's actually a robot driving car, but look.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   Right.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   Who gets the ticket?
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.780]   Here's the picture from the Jalopnik picture of the guy.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.140]   A lot of khaki there.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.620]   I would love to be hit by that thing.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.180]   I would be suing Google left and right.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.520]   My neck, my back, everything hurts.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   My ear.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.320]   Your robot got peanut butter in my chocolate.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.400]   Even if I was responsible for it, I'm suing the robot.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   You can't talk back.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   That's a robot.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.240]   Well, that is one of the actual serious issues this raises.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.240]   If a robot is driving your car and the human is sitting there but not with the hands on
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.360]   the wheel, you can't ticket the robot.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.440]   You ticket the human, right?
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Do you?
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   Of course you do.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440]   You ticket group.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.320]   Well, why are you going to get a ticket if a robot is driving your car?
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.320]   How is the robot going to get a ticket?
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   Somebody's responsible.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.540]   If Google works on all the kinks, there should be no such thing as the need to ticket a robot
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.700]   car.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.260]   I would like to have this robot car.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.260]   Would you?
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.260]   It's interesting.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.260]   Would you actually, if a car drove itself, you would feel...
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.340]   I mean, I love driving.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:14.100]   I got a little convertible the other day and it's a manual and I just love the feeling
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100]   of driving my car.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   But if I were not...
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.100]   I can't watch that car, you drive.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.100]   Oh, it's a little white me on it.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.100]   It's great.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.100]   I'll go for a spin.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.100]   With a top and all that's great.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.020]   Yeah, but that's because I love cars and driving.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.020]   Right.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.320]   People like getting to the place that they're going to without too much bother.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.920]   You know that, of course, if robots drove cars, there would be far fewer accidents.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920]   Yes.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.520]   There would be far fewer traffic jams because they'd space themselves logically.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.360]   Haven't you had to reboot your phone in the last month or something?
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   Yeah, what are you talking about?
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   You trust robots like that?
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360]   They won't get...
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   They won't taste themselves.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   Hey, so, could you get a robot to watch my kid?
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   I mean, because robots never fail or anything.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.400]   I play one video on this and it explodes and it gets into my...
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.900]   You kind of feel like they can screw up with phones, but I think they know when it
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.880]   comes to cars, those kinds of...
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.640]   They have to have more failsaves than that.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640]   I don't know.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.640]   Then they would phone or...
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.680]   We can't even get that many cars with that auto park thing going on.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.320]   So once they get that in every car and it's standard, then I'll trust robots to drive
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   my car.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   Okay.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.040]   When you don't have to spend $80,000 on Alexis to get to go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.520]   Actually, Ford cars do that now.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   So, Alexia wrote a great...
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520]   Some Ford cars do that.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.520]   A great article.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.520]   Google...
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   Google...
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   Eric Schmitz, Google's...
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.520]   Google Pants.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520]   Pants.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.600]   His e-commerce fantasy, you called it.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.600]   I love Eric Schmitz.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.700]   I wish he lived with me, so he could just tell me crazy stuff.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.700]   He's a character.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.700]   Schmitz says.
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.700]   It's a new Twitter...
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.980]   It's like you're driving in your car and your car somehow knows that you need a new
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.540]   pair of pants because you're not wearing any pants.
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.540]   And the car's like...
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.540]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.540]   He said...
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.540]   How does he drive?
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.540]   Oh my God.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.540]   I don't want to know how he drives, actually.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.540]   He could drive in a clip.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.540]   It's insane.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540]   All right.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.540]   Let me play...
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540]   This is the clip.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.540]   I have the clip.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.540]   The journalist just started laughing.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.540]   He needs a robot, obviously.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.200]   He's telling you he doesn't drive with pants.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   Eric Schmitz from TechCrunch.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.000]   He needs a robot to drive him around.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   E-commerce.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   There's an advertisement.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   Hold on a second.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   Of course there's an advertisement.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Oh.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Here we go.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Listen.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.240]   So think of it in the following way.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.640]   So you are driving down the street and again this is all opt in which you're going to put
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   from all that.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   And your phone...
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   Can I hear it?
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640]   ...phone...
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.960]   Somehow the phone knows you need new pants.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:25.500]   So you told it or just on time or whatever.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.180]   So you realize there's a pants store on the left, a pants store on the right.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.900]   To Google offers there's an offer for a 15% discount on the left and a 20% discount on
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.200]   the right.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.860]   The computer concludes that you should turn right.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.540]   It says turn right for your pants or whatever.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.580]   You park, you walk into the store, the system understands you'd walk into the store, the
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.900]   store person brings out the correct size pants for you.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:53.960]   You take the phone, you tap and pay, they hand you the pants and you walk out the store.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.460]   Again all opt in.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:56.460]   You've chosen this.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.160]   So it's going to pull that off.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.920]   You've got to have the NFC chip, the Android phones, this version of the Android phone has
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.640]   the NFC chip in it.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.480]   We are in the process of summer.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.520]   You can't be wearing any pants.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520]   He is a strange bird.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   Is it?
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520]   How do you buy pants if you're not wearing pants?
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.020]   How do you get to go into the store?
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.020]   How does he have this thing?
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.840]   So he says that on the left is 60% on the right is 40%.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.880]   Your phone says turn right because you've got a better deal on the pants.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.920]   Then you go into the store and the store somehow knows that you walk in and he needs
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920]   pants.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.820]   Oh yes, hello sir.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.020]   We see you need pants.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.200]   I'm sure they take you to the back as soon as you walk in the door and say that or they
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   stick you out.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   He is legendary for his just strange utterances.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.680]   Well he said that people need to change their name.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.000]   He made a joke that people should just change their name in 18 to 4.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   When you get to be 18.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   Right, exactly.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And it was a joke.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.600]   I mean he in the same conversation, he starts the conversation with the reporters at Sun Valley
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.400]   saying like ha ha ha, reporters tend to take what I say out of context.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.160]   For example I was joking about how people need to change their names or get plastic
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:09.920]   surgery or whatever they need to do to avoid their life of Google shame.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   And then he goes into saying this crazy pants stuff and I love the idea.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:22.280]   What he's talking about is basically like closing the deal loop or a customer knowing
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.920]   having a desire and having the store feel the desire through mobile GPS technology and
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:35.320]   then NFC and then like I don't know Google Wallet which is coming out in the fall.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.800]   So technology wise it's possible if everything works.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.440]   Now knowing what I know about retail and the cash register system, the credit card system,
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.920]   what is going to work so seriously?
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.840]   Don't I have Amazon Prime and don't I have like Zappos, like next day delivery?
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   Can I wait for pants?
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.400]   But can't you go right now into some places in San Francisco?
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.520]   I can't remember what the coffee shop is if they have that little square thing where
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520]   you go in.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520]   You find it.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520]   It's a cycloc.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520]   Have you used it?
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.840]   No I haven't and I want to.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.600]   So tell us how that works.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.400]   So I think you go.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   It's on your phone.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400]   It's on your phone.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.480]   But for cycloc I think they just have a square dongle so they accept credit card payments.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.720]   But there's more than that where there are companies now that square enables a card
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.960]   case that it recognizes this case on your phone.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.520]   It says you came in, oh Alexia you like a what is this?
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.720]   A skinny vanilla latte.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720]   Actually this is Jolie's.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.120]   Jolie you like skinny vanilla latte.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.120]   It starts making it for you.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.920]   It charges you automatically and it gives you the when you walk in it's like your pants.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.920]   It gives you the latte.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.240]   I think they are comfortable with this whole use of technology to solve these flimsy little
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   first world problems.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.960]   It's not really a big problem.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.320]   I can't remember what kind of latte are like.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   That's a good point.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.720]   What is commerce if not a bunch of first world problems?
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.520]   Come on don't be a snob.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.520]   I'm not being a snob.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.520]   It's not a big.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   First world problems.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   Ew.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.320]   No we need to solve commercial problems to a point but then I think we're getting a little
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   bit more fun.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   You're a little bit more ridiculous.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   She has a point.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.420]   There's a lot of effort put into things like not having to speak to the barista.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   Let's put it this way.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.220]   If you go somewhere all the time.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.220]   There's time.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.680]   If you go somewhere all the time what is called is good customer service.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.280]   There are a lot of places that I go to where trust me I'm big I eat they know what I want.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.640]   I walk in the door like hey whip it up get them there we go.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.840]   I don't need nothing on my phone.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   You know.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   They see my face.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840]   They know me in there nothing.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   People take interest you know.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.000]   There will be an article in the Des Moines Register in six months saying San Francisco.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.080]   San Francisco yuppies figure out way to avoid ordering coffee and mocking it because it
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   only had San Francisco.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.240]   There's a big humanity out of life when you make your attempt to eat everything for you.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240]   You guys understand geeks.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   Geeks don't really want to have interfaces.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   That was scary.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.800]   I'm a deeply shy person so I get that.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   Yeah you're an introvert.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   I am introvert.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   Introverts.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.240]   This is remember all of this stuff is designed by people who are deeply introverted.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   Again.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.640]   When you use that to avoid human contact it just makes the introversion worse to the point
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.800]   that you are afraid to leave your house and get in a car.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.280]   I love this buying pants is not a preferable human interaction comment.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   Yes.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   Why?
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   Okay sure.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.640]   Interacting in a coffee shop or in a library or someplace where there's a shared interest.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.480]   Are you really going to become best friends with a person who should buy it?
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.040]   For pants I'll do the pants.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   No here's the point.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.680]   At some point all that stuff will go away.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.280]   I was at the movie theater the other night and the girl that was giving my popcorn soda
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.280]   had an attitude.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.280]   She was having a bad day.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280]   I'm like having a bad day.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   She's like yeah.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280]   I said well you should be happy you have a job.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.280]   A lot of people don't even have a job.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.280]   She's like yeah I guess.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.680]   I'm like well I'm spending $20 for popcorn so I'm keeping you in a job.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.400]   She's like I guess you're not really keeping me in a job.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.280]   I'm like well if everybody stopped coming here to get popcorn from you because you have
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.760]   an attitude I can go to a machine next week and get one it won't say anything.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.160]   So I'd perk up if I were you because you'll be fired.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.840]   It's all relative and it's nice to talk to people.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.800]   This goes back to a fantasy.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.240]   I like looking at you.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   Not too much him.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.240]   You too.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   Not so much him.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240]   He's called me ugly four times.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   I'll say you were ugly.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.000]   You did to ask the chat room.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   Poor Owen.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   Beautiful ladies.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   Poor Owen.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   That's what I keep saying.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.320]   This goes back to a fantasy and a commerce fantasy that's ancient that remember we'd have
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.560]   internet connected refrigerators and when you ran out of milk the milk would come peepod
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.560]   with peepod.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.160]   With the liver your milk to the door right.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.840]   I think the fantasy is on the brands side where.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.000]   It's the brands who love this idea.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.960]   You don't have to want something.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   They'll just buy it for you.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.520]   We know what you want and we'll make sure you get it.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520]   Good God.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.040]   Does anybody even really have to want anything?
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]   We have so many.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.040]   Like here's a discovery commerce app.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.080]   Like no we need less of that.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.040]   Isn't that really bad part of the problem is innovation is driven has to be driven by
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:47.040]   something and it is in at least in this country most often driven by commercial interest.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040]   If we're not going to do it unless there's some money to be made.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.040]   It's not a charity.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.880]   Well yeah I think you can do good things that solve real problems and still make money
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.040]   from them.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.920]   I don't think making money is as problematic when you're solving a problem that everyone
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   has.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.920]   Right.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   Well it comes from the Jetsons.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.600]   Like who didn't watch the Jetsons and think it was amazingly cool.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.720]   I want a conveyor belt to walk my dog on.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.360]   I'm looking for it and we wouldn't be caring about.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.080]   We wouldn't care about flying cars if it weren't for the Jetsons.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.880]   We're going to trade in your cute little car for a bicycle.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.640]   We're going to send you to Africa to dig wells.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.240]   You are going to save the world and I'm going to watch you do it.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.240]   So who wants a car?
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.640]   Because we're going to take that's the first time we're taken.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   He has dibs.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   Okay.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]   I do have dibs.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   No I have very happy with my Mustang.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   I know.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   Thank you very much.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.440]   So I think the Cyclos doesn't do pre-ordering yet.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.800]   It's that one AT&T commercial.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.800]   You will.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   You will.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   You know though.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.640]   You will commercial like nine out of ten things where they got.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.440]   Except it wasn't made by AT&T.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   Yeah they got it.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   AT&T didn't make any of it.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   I had nothing to do with that.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   I watched that commercial like really?
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   Those are great commercial.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   What?
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440]   Okay.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.200]   So that most everything is a video phone calls.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.080]   The one thing that AT&T could have done.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.320]   That was the one thing that really didn't happen.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.160]   I guess it's happening now with Skype.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160]   Did anybody, I just, I always do this poll.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.040]   Anybody use make video phone calls?
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   I do.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   Yes you do.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   I do.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.040]   I do.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040]   Just for the novelty fact.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   On your phone?
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   Oh no.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   On Skype.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   On Facebook and on Google+.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.680]   I have the Skype app on my phone and I have not yet had a reason to use it.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.680]   I don't think people really want to do it.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.680]   But even if you weren't.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.640]   I don't mean what kind of person I want to see.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   I tell you.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   I would do it with my family.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   Listen, I tell you.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   I call my daughter every three days when I travel.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   I use a video.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   I use FaceTime and you know what the crazy thing is?
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   I guess that would be good.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   She's so used to it because she has her an iPod touch so I call it on her phone.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.160]   Like when I say give me a hug she hugs the phone dude.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.960]   And it is the cutest like I'm a big.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   That's weird.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.520]   And it just makes me so I'm like oh and she kisses me.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.520]   That's either deeply touching or deeply sad.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520]   I can't figure out.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   No it's cute because we...
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.920]   The catch's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.160]   Little Bob Blue and the man in the moon.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160]   Look.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   I'm home dead.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160]   I gave you an iPod touch.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   What do you care?
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   I know.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.160]   Well let's put this way.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.160]   It's cute.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   This is a great picture.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   Do we have an over the shoulder chat?
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   This is really cool.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   Do we have the over the shoulder chat?
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   No we don't.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160]   Chads running to turn on the camera.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.440]   Oh here we can do it.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.080]   This is a cute picture.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.600]   Look at that.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.600]   That's actually a video.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.080]   She's looking at the plane.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.440]   So I mean she's used to technology.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.080]   She has her an iPod.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   She knows how it works.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   She can turn on.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080]   She's four.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   She can make calls on it.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   She can call me or her mom.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.160]   And she thinks you're an iPod touch.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.200]   She thinks I'm a TV star.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.040]   She taught my 93 o' grandmother how to use the iPad.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040]   Wow.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   She taught her.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040]   She was like, "Grandma look we can read a book.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040]   We can watch a video."
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   I'm like.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040]   Can I see the movie?
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040]   How do we start the movie?
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   That's all right.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   Don't worry about it.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040]   I'll tell you.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040]   I got another movie.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040]   I got another movie.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.200]   Tom Merritt is here from TNT.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.200]   Our new show.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.880]   We do this every Monday through Friday.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.080]   230 Pacific 530 Eastern time.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.440]   He's got a look at the week ahead.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   Tom.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440]   Hey thanks Leo.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.920]   Here's a look at the week ahead.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.080]   Some of the stories will be covering on Tech News today.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.480]   August is kind of a slow month, but there's some interesting conferences this week.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.520]   Sea Graph Vancouver starts off today.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.000]   Sunday August 7th runs through August 11th.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.160]   Also starting today in Philadelphia.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.000]   Apco International Conference and Expo.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.520]   It's a public safety tech conference.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.400]   On Tuesday the 14th annual Technology Communications Conference from Oppenheimer begins in Boston,
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]   Massachusetts.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.840]   And on Friday, reach into your pockets and get ready to buy a Nintendo 3DS as the price
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.840]   drops to $170 in the US.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.840]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.840]   Back to you Leo.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840]   Thank you Tom Merritt.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.840]   Catch Tom every Monday through Friday on TNT at live.twit.tv.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.040]   Come back with our guests.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.840]   The fabulous Ninja Hippo himself.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.840]   Oh, dakka.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.840]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   How did I discover you?
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.720]   Lisa actually discovered me because we were drinking together so far by Southwest.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.840]   She said, "You're funny.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.840]   You should be on Twitter."
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840]   And I said, "Yeah, I know Leo."
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   And then I showed up.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.800]   And you said, "So what are you famous for?"
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   And I said, "Nothing."
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.080]   So what do you do?
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   People like me.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   He's like, "That's right.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   People like you, I guess."
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.080]   He's very likable.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.080]   Yeah, he's a likable kid.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.080]   And the chatroom actually likes me now.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.080]   When I first was on the show they were like, "Get him off.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   He doesn't even have a Wikipedia page."
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.520]   And he was like, "Oh, it cuts not."
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520]   Deep.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520]   Deep.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.520]   Deep.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520]   Deep.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   I was appearing on Twitter to have a Wikipedia page.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520]   And you know what?
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   You keep doing it, you will.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520]   Somebody's going to make it.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520]   Someday.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520]   Someday.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.520]   Someday.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520]   You will have a Wikipedia page.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520]   Chat.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520]   Good on that.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   I'll be back.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]   Tom.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   And Jolie O'Dell.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.380]   Formerly of Mashable, that's where you've seen her for a long time.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.800]   How about a year and a half years.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   But now at venturebeat.com.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.360]   A great place for you.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360]   What is your beat?
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.000]   What do you cover at Venture Beat?
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.960]   Do you have a beat where you can do anything you want?
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.800]   I don't know why I don't cover.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.080]   I try to step in where I'm needed, but I like talking about development topics, Android stuff.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.440]   I follow Google and Facebook from a business and development.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.920]   You said you were excited about going there because you'd get to cover more of what you
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.920]   were interested in.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.920]   And that would be the best idea.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920]   Hard, thinky stuff.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.920]   Thinky pieces.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]   It's not social media.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.920]   I'm kind of into it.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.920]   You're sick of that.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920]   I think we're all pretty sick of that.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920]   Pretty sick of that.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   That's another challenge.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   No more Google+ stories.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   Enough.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Alexia Sosas, what do you cover on TechCrunch?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.560]   I cover startups.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560]   I cover a lot.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.360]   Well, I think TechCrunch is the startup blog.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.000]   I mean, these startup blogs.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.200]   Has it been different since AOL acquired you?
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.600]   People ask me that a lot.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.480]   And I was the last employee before the acquisition.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.800]   So I actually don't know.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   I have no idea.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.080]   But no, you've been there longer than--
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.240]   I've been there a year.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.960]   So I got there in August.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   Right before the interview.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.360]   And we required, I think, in September.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   Oh, OK.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.840]   So I've got no basis for comparison.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840]   Nothing different.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.280]   Nope, not different at all.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.440]   And have you met Ariana?
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.440]   Yes, I have.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.840]   She's a nice lady, isn't she?
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.640]   She's very, very smart.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.640]   She is good.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.800]   I interviewed her when she wrote, many years ago, a biography of Picasso when she was Ariana
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.800]   Stassanophilus.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.160]   That was a lot of words to say.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.960]   And so I didn't get her.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.000]   I did an interview for an hour.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.320]   It took me that entire time to get her name right.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.960]   Ariana Stassanophilus Huffington.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.400]   See, I still know how to do it.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.840]   We're going to take a break, come back with more, and just a little bit of a reminder,
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:01.880]   though, that if you are looking for a place to make your website, we don't mention WordPress.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.840]   Everybody uses WordPress, but there are some negatives to WordPress.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.480]   First of all, you got either you got to find a host or use WordPress.com.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.280]   And then they're going to put their ads on your site.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.040]   And once you find the host, then you've got to install WordPress.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.320]   And here's the big burden for me.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.760]   I have to check almost daily to make sure that it's up to date, that it's secure because
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.000]   it's constantly constant patches.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.240]   I got to tell you, simple, simple, simple.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   You're looking for hosting.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.240]   You're looking for great software, a great content management system, Squarespace.com.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.960]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:42.840]   They host really good hosting that never goes down because Squarespace has a very sophisticated
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:47.840]   virtual server technology that's tightly integrated with the software to give you really, really
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840]   good performance.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.040]   The software, there's none better.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.960]   They've got the great iPhone and iPad app importing and exporting.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   That's important.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:00.080]   You're never trapped from the big four blog APIs, moveable type, WordPress type pad and
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.080]   blogger.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.080]   By the way, when they say seamless, I mean it.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.600]   All the links are preserved, all the images, all the SEO.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.040]   If you're a photographer or you want to have a photo gallery on your site, I know a lot
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.360]   of you do.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.400]   There are amazing tools for that.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.640]   Everything on Squarespace is simple.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.440]   Point and click, drag and drop.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.360]   If you are sophisticated, you're not limited.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.760]   You can use, of course, CSS and you can use JavaScript, but you don't have to to create
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.840]   an amazing looking site that is unique.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:30.840]   That's important.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.440]   Some great developer templates from the best designers in the world make it very, very
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440]   easy.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.840]   Look, do yourself a favor.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.840]   Try this free.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.760]   It couldn't be easier to try Squarespace.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:45.160]   If you're in the market for somewhere for your next website, go to squarespace.com.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.240]   See that big green try it free button, click that.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.880]   No credit card, nothing.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   No commitment.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.200]   You get it for free.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.760]   Full access to everything they offer for two weeks.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.560]   All you need is the name of the site, the password and the email address that you're in.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.560]   Now after two weeks, I think you're going to love it.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.720]   You're going to have a chance to sign up.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.640]   This is no ads, nothing.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   It's not free.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   You have to pay for it.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.880]   That's why there's no ads on it and it's very affordable.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:18.040]   In fact, the longer you sign up for the less expensive it is, as little as $10.67 a month.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.720]   But I'm going to add an additional kind of sweetener here.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:26.240]   If you use the offer code TWIT8, TWIT, the number eight, no spaces, you'll get an additional
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.280]   10% off for the first six months of your site.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.000]   So many of my friends use Squarespace.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.800]   We use it for our inside TWIT blog.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.600]   It's very robust, very reliable, really great software.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.760]   Squarespace.com.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.360]   They're friends and I invite you to give them a try.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.520]   At least include them in your comparison shopping.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.880]   Just to piggyback on that, their mobile app is awesome.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   Isn't it amazing?
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   Their mobile app is phenomenal.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.680]   And you can not only just post, but you can moderate.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.200]   You get stats and all that stuff.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.360]   And the widgets they have now, it sounds silly, but finding a good four square app is like
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   that for WordPress.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   It's kind of hard.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.760]   They have everything built in right now where you can just drop things.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   It just works.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.520]   So you can have a little map pop up.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.920]   If I was driving here and you want to know where I was, you can follow me along.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   Boom, you'd see it.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.920]   So check out Squarespace.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   So you use it.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.520]   I have an upside on it, yeah.
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.760]   Not Angry Hippo.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   No.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.920]   Hey, there'd be a good game.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920]   Angry Hippo.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920]   Angry Hippo.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920]   Angry Hippos.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.920]   There's cocaine hippos.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.920]   Hippo goes crazy.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   Look, okay, so that is.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.920]   After getting high on curfew.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:29.280]   No, you laugh and hippos kill thousands of people every year.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.080]   They're very territorial.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.800]   They're fine and they're docile, but they're quick.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.800]   How do they kill you?
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.800]   Do they gum you?
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.800]   Do they lie on you?
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   They trample you.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.600]   So now something that's two tons comes up and hits you in the chest, your heart's going
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.600]   to stop.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600]   Wow, that's pretty scary.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.040]   Did you know there's something called the Pony Awards?
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.040]   You don't get a pony.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   It's P.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.040]   Memory, right?
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040]   Memory.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.320]   The Pony Awards.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.600]   I've got to go to these.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.440]   I presume this is part of a black hat or a DEF CON.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:08.520]   It's for people who've been pwned and Sony gets the Epic Fail Award, black hat, the
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.520]   Epic Fail Pony Award, of course.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.880]   Who else?
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880]   This was not even a competition.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:19.720]   Sony was hacked over two dozen times over the last six months, over two dozen times.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.400]   Sony has a real, this is a bad year, like they're new portable devices and coming out
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400]   in the States.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.600]   It's only going to be released in Japan limited.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.640]   I'm like, they just have problems.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.120]   I think it all stems from their reaction to Geohod.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.280]   I think if they hadn't been so anti-hacker in the very first place, they pissed everybody
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280]   off.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.240]   They pissed everybody off and then it's like, "Oh, hey, let's just put a target on ourselves."
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   It's literally that problem.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240]   And you just don't do that.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240]   No.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.920]   Well, you also don't fire your security guy.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.400]   You don't use unmodified Apache in MySQL.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.360]   I mean, you do some sensible security things, but you're right.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.600]   And they put a big target on there.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.520]   And how long did they go without updating their servers and their systems?
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.960]   Like, are you kidding me?
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.960]   They were running unpatched.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   Apache.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:10.080]   And that's one of the things where you say, "I use Xbox and I have a PlayStation."
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.880]   I always say, "Oh, the PlayStation is free for people who aren't really in a gaming, but
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.160]   Lord knows, if I have to pay for security, then let me pay because if that's what free
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.320]   gets me, then I don't want to be on free."
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.040]   And you know, "Oh, nobody's credit card, I don't care."
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.560]   That's a huge problem for that size of corporation with millions of people's information on hand.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.560]   You can't have that happen.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.560]   Like, it just can't.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560]   There's other things that could happen.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.560]   The servers could go down.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.400]   But don't tell me some punk kid came in and they should launch because that's not cool.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.480]   Actually, the chatroom, Jolie, reminds me that it wasn't just Geohot.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.240]   Remember that Sony, in an attempt to protect their games, put a root kit on people's computers.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   Remember their DRM?
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240]   I mean, they have a long, bad history.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:55.600]   Yeah, and I think I have in the past contrasted that with the Xbox Connect and Microsoft took
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.000]   this chance of, "Hey, here's this shiny new toy.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   Please hack it."
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.600]   Not at first, but they came around very quickly.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.600]   They really did.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.240]   And I think it kind of saved them in some ways.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.040]   I love the logo for the ponies.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.040]   Well, this whole thing.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.040]   That's my little pony, dude.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   They're going to get sued.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.440]   That is my little pony.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440]   That is me.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440]   That is me.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440]   It's A my little pony.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440]   It's A my little pony.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.640]   I think Jolie knows better than you do.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.640]   My little pony like...
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.640]   I have a don't...
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   How did you know?
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   I just watched my little pony.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.640]   That's like one of my little ponies.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.640]   Let me see your design on her head.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.640]   You have to look on what it...
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640]   No, I don't think it is.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.240]   Does anyone else think they made these awards up just to give an award to Sony?
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240]   Probably.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   No, look.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.240]   They have the best server side bug.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.440]   That goes to ASP.net framework padding.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   The best server size.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   How did they not follow?
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.840]   Best client side bug.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   Free type vulnerability in iOS.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.640]   The best privilege escalation bug.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.680]   You know, it would be great to see people in tuxedos and then they announce all the
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.680]   nominees.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.680]   Can Sony's a love thing?
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:59.640]   I'd like to thank my SP privilege.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.240]   Best most innovative research.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.240]   That's a good one.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.240]   Lifetime achievement award.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.240]   Well, let's see who gets the lifetime achievement award.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.240]   Probably Sony.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.240]   They really deserve it.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.240]   Who deserves it more than Sony?
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240]   It says most...
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.840]   This is from their official website.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.680]   Most hackers have the personality of a supermodel who does discrete mathematics for
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680]   Sony.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   They wish.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.280]   Apparently, someone has been reading my dream book again.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.880]   I should really burn that.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.680]   Didn't know it could get hacked.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   It was on paper.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   But apparently...
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.080]   But I have to say, Geohot won a pony.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.560]   Geohot, of course, the hacker who hacked the Sony PlayStation 3.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.880]   But he got his pony for the best song.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.680]   Let's play Geohot.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.080]   He's a good looking guy.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.480]   Geohot, best song winning.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   Yo, it's Geohot.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.880]   And for those that don't know, I'm getting sued by Sony.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.480]   Let's take a side of the courtroom and into the streets.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.880]   I'm a beast at the least who face me in the Northeast.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.880]   Get my eye up like a fire.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.080]   I'll go harder than Eminem went out for a ride.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.080]   Call me a liar.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080]   Call me in the ass and no lose chafing.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.480]   So with the dude who got the piece, he a safe man.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.280]   Those that can't do ring suits.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.680]   Try to your Uncle Sam to settle disputes.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.080]   Thought you tackled this with a little more tact, but then again, bunch of hackers.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.080]   I don't know Jack.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.680]   I shed a tear every time.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.680]   I think a licksang.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.880]   But **** man, they're a corporation.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.680]   And I'm a personification of freedom for all your filled pockets.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.280]   Like that's a concept for us, you all.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.680]   But lawyers, money, water, and hero, stall.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.880]   Out of business, it's gaffing me.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:31.880]   You're so silly.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.680]   Exhibit this in the courtroom.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.880]   Go on, do it.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880]   I dare you.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.880]   I gotta say, I like that.
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.880]   I like that.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.680]   By the way, he got a job.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.880]   He is working now at Facebook.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880]   See?
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   So I say you act stuff, you get a job.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   You get a job.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.880]   That's style.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   Guys get style.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   I think it's really nice.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.880]   We just tell everybody that I hacked to it, but I don't do it.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.880]   So I get a job, but we pretend like it happened.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.080]   Okay, what job do you want?
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.080]   I don't know.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.880]   Somebody's going to start throwing money at me and I'm going to have my pickle of the
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:04.880]   litter.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   Is that how it works?
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.880]   Sure.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.880]   Whatever you say.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   That's how it worked.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   One J.J. Stone.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.080]   Flickr reaches six billion photos uploaded.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.120]   Do you think they'll get to seven billion?
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.080]   How much longer before somebody puts Flickr out of its misery?
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.080]   Six.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.080]   Is it in misery?
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.080]   I think it is.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.080]   I think it's in the same.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.080]   How do you make money aside from pro accounts?
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.080]   That's the misery.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.640]   And do the pro accounts even cover the hosting costs?
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.040]   The real misery is its own by Yahoo.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.160]   That's the real pain in all of this.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.640]   But no, I think this is actually a very good question and I've talked to people at Yahoo's
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.600]   site who say they try to make money selling calendars and prints and all this stuff.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.560]   And it just doesn't work.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:45.720]   They make very little money, very little, sell very little of this stuff.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.000]   The costs of Flickr's bandwidth alone are...
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.720]   Why aren't they running ads?
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:53.120]   I mean, it's the lamest business model ever, but they could do it.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.080]   And to be honest with you?
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.760]   Not only just running ads, but they should do what Snapshots does.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.120]   They should remind people to get prints and tell them they get prints super cheap.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.760]   I print one time off of Snapshots and I'm actually annoyed.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.080]   You'll never stop hearing from them.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.080]   I'll never stop hearing from them.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.080]   But you know what the thing is?
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.720]   I sit there and I haven't turned them off because I wait 200 prints for a dollar.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   Boom, I'm on that.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.640]   100 prints for $5, so that's not a good deal.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.720]   But they just run these things and they get me to buy them.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.920]   I buy them because they're cheap and it's nice to have pictures.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.480]   But if they weren't so cheap, I wouldn't do it.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   But they just market.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.480]   They market.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.480]   They don't stop.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.480]   Flickr doesn't do anything.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:30.480]   I pay Flickr 50 bucks every two years.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.120]   I don't hear from them until I have to pay again.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   People are still using Flickr.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120]   I use it.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.360]   2500 photos uploaded per minute.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.480]   This is the 6th billionth photo.
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.240]   It is a Montbratia flower.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.480]   Lucky then it was a nice photo, right?
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.480]   Yeah, it's a beautiful photo.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.840]   Yeah, wouldn't it be terrible if it was a guy like sitting in the middle of the camera.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   No, don't go there.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   Looking for payers.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.840]   Sitting in this living room.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.440]   All of a glitter milestone photos are fantastic though.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.720]   I mean it's just too suspicious.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.720]   It's like a waterfall.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:04.040]   They're like a photo from space.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:08.520]   Well if they're 2500 images a minute, they can pick a few.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   They have a few to pick from.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   They can't tell.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.120]   It could be this one or this one, right?
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.960]   No, I mean don't they all have unique numbers.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.960]   Yeah, they've got unique numbers.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.960]   They can tell.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   They can't tell stuff though.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   They could lie.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   And let's put this one.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   And beauty is relative.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.800]   Somebody might think that that's a crappy picture.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.120]   No, but the guy with no pants in his living room and a camo.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   What is he doing this guy?
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120]   No pants in the living room.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   Do you need me to help you evict someone?
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.160]   But you know, Flickr is tiny compared to her home.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160]   Facebook.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.160]   Wait, that's on the back.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.160]   So 6 billion photos on Flickr.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.160]   Facebook gets 100 million photos every single day.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.160]   How about 75 billion?
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.160]   I've always been shared on Facebook or something.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.320]   I mean I actually moved my pictures to Facebook.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.560]   I pay for Flickr but I was worried about them.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.520]   So I just started moving all my pictures to Facebook.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.960]   So because people actually look at them on Facebook as opposed to Flickr.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.160]   I mean Flickr is hurting.
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.680]   They just now instituted social features.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.680]   Now.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.680]   Yeah, like I said, nobody looks at them.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.560]   Who cares about social features when your app is about photography?
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560]   Well, here's.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.560]   Oh, I know.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.560]   Instagram.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.560]   No, but I'm just not even.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.560]   I'm just not even.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.560]   You're an intro.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.560]   They don't even.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.560]   They don't even.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.400]   It's the third thing I check every morning.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.400]   I love Instagram.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   Addiction.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   Addiction.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.400]   But they're not even in the market.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.920]   They're not even like locker rooms or PICC or you know, TwitPIC.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.240]   And if they were in that market, people would be looking at those pictures.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:24.240]   TwitPIC is doing all right.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.240]   They've monetized quite well.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.880]   Like I said, if they were in that market or they've moved to that market, they'd be
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.760]   doing good because they have higher quality pictures, you know, lobby, blobby, they just
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   don't do it.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.120]   And why they don't do it is because something is not right.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.120]   It's Yahoo.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   Yahoo.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.120]   Yahoo.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.120]   Yeah, who call me?
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120]   I'll help you.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   Yahoo is.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   I don't know why, but they just.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   They're not breaking.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.120]   Remember when Tim and he West, like the early designer on the soccer team wrote a blog.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.120]   I can.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.720]   So Tim and he West, the one of the designers on at Flickr wrote a blog post saying this
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:54.880]   is how Flickr, this is how I wanted to innovate, adding social features, cleaning up the interface.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.120]   And no one, sadly, those plans were discarded.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.240]   So when one of your key designers is writing on her own personal blog that this is how
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.200]   I would change our product and you don't implement this stuff.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:10.400]   I mean, I'm surprised that Tim and he's not at Facebook or even at Google or somewhere
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   that's not.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.120]   I'm sure that's what she was hoping.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.120]   Please hire me.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.320]   I have some ideas.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320]   Don't judge me, please.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320]   I will.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.960]   Amazon has founded as start going right up against Goodreads.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.840]   Speaking of social, I know you guys are done with social and blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.600]   Well, the Amazon thing is really interesting.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.440]   This is very interesting.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.920]   If you sign on, it's kindle.amazon.com.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.280]   If you sign into your Amazon account, it will automatically populate.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.160]   Let me sign in right now and I'll show you it automatically populates with all the books
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.520]   you have on your Kindle.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.280]   But also, so if I go to your books, I haven't done anything on this site.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.480]   I just sign in with my Amazon.com account.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:52.400]   Not only all the books I've ever bought on the Kindle, but also if you say put everything
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.200]   in there, see, it's kindle only.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.800]   You'll show all the books you've ever bought on Amazon.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.760]   If you, as most people do, I think these days, buy all your books from Amazon, this is a
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.880]   pre-populated Goodreads and it's very similar to Goodreads.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   You can rate it.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.680]   You can show your reading status.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.520]   You can make that public.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.440]   You can add public notes.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.120]   Why do you think this is interesting, Alexia?
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.880]   Because of something like Quora, the next frontier, I think, in social networking is
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.480]   the interest graph, which is what I'm assuming you're trying to pull off with your ninja
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   hippo thing.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.480]   And...
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   Oh!
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   Got it.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   I think you just got iced.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   I think you got iced.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   But it's like...
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.480]   She may have Cinderella on her laptop lid.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.480]   I know.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.480]   But she's really the evil queen.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.480]   It's no white.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.480]   Why is it?
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.480]   I mean, snow white.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.480]   Whatever, snow white.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.480]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   Snow white.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.480]   Snow white.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.720]   So I'm seeing all these services trying to take off chunks of the interest graph and I'm
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.680]   seeing Quora doing the best job of it.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   And I just saw the Amazon.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   Or a campy.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.440]   You can't go much farther though, right?
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   I mean...
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.440]   I think it can.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440]   I think it can scale.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.440]   You think?
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.280]   I think the story of tech is distribution and I think that if you can get people like
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.280]   celebrities with lorage.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.280]   Here's the problem I see with Quora.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.720]   It's a lot of work to answer these questions.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.720]   It's a lot of work.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.720]   What's the payoff?
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.320]   The payoff is adding to the total sum of human knowledge.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.320]   No, no, no.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320]   But you just said celebrities.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.840]   You just said if you can get celebrities on it, they're going to add to the total sum
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.840]   of some knowledge.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.640]   Ashton Kutcher's been doing a great job.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.840]   So celebrities, here's the sense of celebrities.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.840]   No, Larry Summers, who was the president of Harvard, he was a secretary of treasury.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.840]   He's a celebrity.
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.840]   Yeah, he's a secretary of treasury.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.480]   Now he advises Andrew St. Horowitz.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.000]   He's on there answering questions about the US economy.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   Oh, I disagree.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.320]   It's great for the reader.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.720]   I mean, it's Wikipedia.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.560]   It's great for the reader.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:42.280]   But I think that it's kind of hard to just say that this is going to scale.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.360]   People will just go on here and answer questions.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.440]   And it's less accessible than just asking the internet.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.440]   Well, that's true.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.680]   And you tend to see the same stuff over and over again.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.240]   I mean, the entire institution of academia is based around this.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.240]   It's based around this.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.800]   Yeah, but they have paid to do it.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.800]   It's a job.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.720]   And I think chorus struggling with that-- oh, not struggling.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.960]   Chorus dealing with that as a problem at this point and trying to figure out how to incentivize
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.960]   music.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.240]   I have to admit, this question, is it fun for movie stars to kiss other movie stars on
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.240]   screen?
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.960]   The number one answer, Ashton Kutcher, he says, I live it.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.400]   Are you a better person for knowing?
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.400]   I read us lately.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.640]   And that's revolting even to me.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.640]   Right?
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.200]   I should just drill a hole in my brain right now.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:29.760]   He's also answering questions, what are the best cures for hangovers?
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.880]   How does a programmer become a programmer?
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.720]   That's an amazing chorus thread.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   You mean to go on there.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.720]   It's amazing.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.720]   It's so--
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.720]   No, it's a programmer.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:39.720]   It's a programmer.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:44.280]   A programmer is like, OK, so the best part about that thread is that coders and programmers
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:50.680]   are traditionally dorky, stereotypically.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   Stereotypically.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.920]   That they don't get with girls, they don't go to the gym.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.720]   So these programmer dudes, they're trying to tip the stereotype on its head.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.920]   They're not going to say Roseville writing code.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.400]   But no, they're trying to be coders that are also bros, the coders that-- it's taken
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.840]   off a Jersey Shore.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.480]   It's sad that smart people want to ascend to being bros.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:15.480]   It's amazing.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.640]   I'm a genius, but being a bro would make you cool.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   GCL.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   GCL.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.640]   GCL.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.640]   This is a great thread.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   It's an amazing-- look at this, protein.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   No, I'm with you on this.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.640]   I should smack that dude.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.640]   Anybody who would pop collage and smack by me.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.920]   No, but that's what's funny about this thread.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.920]   This is awesome.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.600]   This is really appropriate for mocking the people who made their lives miserable and
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.600]   healthy.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.520]   So maybe you convinced me of the value of war.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   It's fantastic.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.320]   It's a piece of culture.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.320]   It's one of the most amazing--
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.320]   It's a piece of culture.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.320]   It's a piece of culture.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.920]   These people who have been marginalized as nerds are trying to re-appropriate the stereotypes
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.840]   by making fun of-- making fun, but also kind of being bros.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.840]   What do bros do?
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.840]   Jam, tan, laundry, girls.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.840]   Laundry?
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.840]   They do laundry?
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840]   You might have to ride in the back seat, Missy.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.040]   I'm going to have to put you in the back seat on the way home.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   No.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   Next story.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.880]   No, no much on this show.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.840]   Bro-grammers, I will look.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.120]   OK, so what's interesting about the Amazon social network is if you--
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.480]   Now, OK, going back to that.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.880]   Although I have to say if you ask me Reddit, ask me anything, is often as interesting.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.720]   I'm not more interested in the Quora.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.520]   Totally.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:27.320]   But anyway, going back to this kindle.amazon.com, their new reading social network.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.560]   What-- obviously some value to publishers.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.320]   Well, I mean, if it doesn't turn into like a ping for books--
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:34.320]   Right.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.320]   Which it has the potential to--
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   Which it has the potential to.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.720]   It could be glorious.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.400]   So I think there's a site, Goodreads, that already does.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400]   That's what I use.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.400]   I use Goodreads.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   I like Goodreads.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.640]   But if you channel all that data into an actual commerce platform.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   There's more than Goodreads.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.640]   There's a shelfari.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.640]   There's a bunch of different sites like this.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   But I actually--
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.920]   Isn't this ultimately more useful to people selling books than to people reading them?
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920]   Call me a clinical--
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:57.920]   No.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.920]   --to be here for us.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.920]   No.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.880]   Because one of the attributes of somebody reads books is they're always looking for recommendations
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.320]   for other books, right?
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.560]   So if there's-- normally you do that with real people.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.560]   What is he read lately, Jolie?
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560]   You're getting to do like?
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560]   You know, there are book reviews and magazines and--
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.560]   It's not the same.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.560]   So it's a social exercise.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.560]   It's a social exercise.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   So you go to your friends and say, what are you reading?
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   So to avoid talking to somebody in real life, you go get Amazon.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.560]   But you can't always--
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560]   But you can always go to your friends.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.560]   Where do you track what you read and they sell you more things to read?
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.360]   And it's not a neutral recommendation.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.040]   You can't always go to your friends.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.360]   I don't use stuff like this.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.560]   Like when I want to read a book, I actually talk to someone.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.000]   I want to know why the book is good.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.480]   I don't want to know that you read it if I start.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.480]   Why did you read it if I start?
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:40.480]   Well, that's what you do on a very--
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.480]   Tell me a passage of the book that's often amazed me going by it right now.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.480]   No, but that's what you're doing.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480]   I know.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.480]   But I just want to talk to people about books.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   I don't want to put a list up and go buy off of a list.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.480]   When you get book recommendations from real people, also, you're not--
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.480]   I'm a real person.
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.480]   If you get my recommendation, you're getting--
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.480]   I'm a real person.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.480]   It's just one lie.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.480]   Just because behavior happens online doesn't make it fake.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.480]   Do you know real people?
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.480]   Speaking of 20 years of the World Wide Web, is it 95% of all telecommunication routed
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.480]   through the internet at this point?
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:02.480]   It is, sure.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.480]   I don't think there's anything wrong with this.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480]   You follow people you know.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.480]   I'm assuming wrong with it.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   I just personally would like to ask.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.480]   No, this is better than that.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   It's like Twitter.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.480]   You can follow people you care about.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   You think you're interesting.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.480]   And get their recommendations.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   I couldn't necessarily-- I'm going to use Aston Kutcher.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   I don't couldn't care less what he's reading.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480]   Did you know I'm Aston?
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.480]   Aston.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   But isn't that his name?
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.480]   Aston.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   Let's go with Aston.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:28.480]   But if I wanted to know if I thought oh, Aston is such an intellectual.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   He said, "Dude, do you need me?"
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.480]   That's what happens when you get waving on the show.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.480]   They just giggle.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.480]   That's the stereotype.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.480]   And I don't think that this happens actually.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   But it's true today.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:40.480]   It's a funny show though.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.480]   I mean, it's particularly a funny show.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   Funny how.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   Do I amuse you?
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480]   Aston's on Amazon.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   Aston is on Amazon.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.480]   And I want to-- let's say I thought he was a great intellectual and I'd like to know what he reads.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.480]   But I don't, obviously.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.480]   But somebody else.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.480]   I don't know.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.480]   Stephen Hawking's on Amazon.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:00.480]   And he's saying what physics books are good to read.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.480]   That I care about.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.480]   That I care about.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   And that's something I'm not going to normally have in real life, right?
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   So there's some social value to that.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.480]   But everything you say on these websites is turned into an advertisement later.
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:12.480]   Dad, they got to monetize.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.480]   So what?
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.480]   You don't like that?
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480]   Because everything has to be monetized.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:16.480]   Yes.
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   Well, somebody has to pay for that.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480]   Leo.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.480]   I mean, people ask on a damn life.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   You said it yourself.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.480]   You said it yourself.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.480]   The library costs money now.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   You have to pay for that.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480]   You said it yourself.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480]   You said it yourself.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.480]   If it's not, you know, you are the product.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.480]   If it's not selling a product, you are the product.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480]   So if you want a free service.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.480]   But you are buying books on, is that a free service?
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480]   I mean, Amazon is money.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.480]   And Amazon isn't.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.480]   It means money every time you buy a Kindle or a book.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:46.480]   But you can make money too if you do an affiliate through Amazon and then promote the book that you think is good.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.480]   I already do that.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.480]   Because you want to make money.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   And Leo.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   Oh, there's a lot of money to be made in that.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.480]   Unless you live in California, by the way.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480]   What's wrong in California?
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.480]   Because California passed a law saying Amazon had to collect sales tax and Amazon had an easy fit and save money.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.480]   And Amazon had an easy fit and said, by the way, all the associates in California, bye-bye.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.480]   You're not getting any more money.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:04.480]   That's horrible.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]   Well, it's an interesting thing.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.480]   This happened a few weeks ago.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   I pay legally, you're supposed to pay sales tax even if the vendor doesn't collect it.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.480]   They call it use tax in California.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:21.480]   So they ask you on your California income tax form, you know, did you buy a bunch of stuff online?
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.480]   We'll give us the use tax.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:30.480]   I paid last year $6,000 in use tax on Amazon.com, but I also made about $20,000 on Amazon associates.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   So, okay, now Amazon has to collect that $6,000.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.480]   No longer gives me the $20,000 benefit for them, but the state of California loses the income tax I paid on the $20,000.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.480]   I'll start order everybody route everything through my filly and I'll send you a check.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.480]   Well, I don't, you know, we're probably we're a Delaware corporation.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:47.480]   We're probably just have a go.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:48.480]   There you go.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.480]   A mail-dropping.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480]   But if you better, if you sent me the $20,000.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.480]   That's not the answer.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480]   The state of California.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480]   Well, anyway, it's I don't care.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   That's bad, though.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480]   That's a bad situation.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.480]   Well, it's an example of legislators not understanding the complex interactions.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480]   Oh, they understand it.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   They just want to power stronghold.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480]   It will hurt them.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.480]   That hurt them as well.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.480]   It's nice when the government has revenue to do so.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.480]   They're also, well, but they're losing, and then longer, I think California only should cost them money.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.480]   But what they're really doing is they're listening to the brick and mortar businesses that bookstore down the street who's saying,
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.480]   "Don't buy on Amazon."
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.480]   And we don't want Amazon to exist because people buy there because they save sales tax, and then we're in a high sales tax state.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.480]   It's eight or nine percent.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.480]   So, I mean, I wouldn't go somewhere just to save eight or nine percent, but some people do, I guess.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.480]   I mean, aren't they trying to do something similar with Texas, like giving?
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480]   They've done it in a number of states.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480]   Well, it depends on the purchase.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:44.480]   Like, I drive to Delaware for anything over $1,500 because it costs me $3 for the toll and maybe $5 in gas, and I save $7,800, $200, $300.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.480]   I'll do that to save that money.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.480]   So, it all depends on what you're purchasing.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.480]   Like I said, for you to lose $20,000, that's a nice chunk of change.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.480]   And then on top of you're going to have to put money out, I'd be...
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.480]   By the way, unless anybody thinks that I'm trying to do something nefarious, we are registered as a corporation Delaware.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   We pay corporate taxes in California.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:05.480]   We pay extensive income taxes in California.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.480]   I'm actually not taking money out of California by being a Delaware corporation.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.480]   There's a complicated reasoning that I don't fully understand why we're a Delaware corporation, but that's what we are.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.480]   You're like the big ways to handle that.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.480]   Because it's cheaper in Delaware.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480]   I think so.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]   There was some sort of reason.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   The parts of state, mata.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.480]   The cheaper in Delaware.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.480]   Oh, Dr. Shops here.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.480]   This is definitely a lot of money.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480]   This has been so much fun.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   Will you please come back and do this show again?
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   Absolutely.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   Alexia Totsis, Sotsis.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.480]   Perfect.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:35.480]   Russian? Is it Russian?
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.480]   No, it's Greek.
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.480]   My name's Dessinopoulos.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480]   Dessinopoulos.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.480]   See, and I took me an hour and a half to learn her name too, so I apologize.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480]   We've got another hour.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480]   Dessinopoulos.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:44.480]   Sotsis.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.480]   Oh, no, actually that's perfect.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.480]   That's perfect.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.480]   That's perfect.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.480]   Let's get some muzo and celebrate.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.480]   She writes for TechCrunch.TechCrunch.com.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.480]   TechCrunch.com.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480]   The new 8-bit version.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480]   Available everywhere.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.480]   Did you make your fingernails to match the 8-bit logo?
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.480]   I actually created our logo.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.480]   No, you lie.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480]   You lie.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   You lie.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480]   Liar.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.480]   Thank you for being here.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.480]   Thank you for having me.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480]   Jolio Dell.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480]   I've been trying to get you on the show for ages.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.480]   I just didn't realize I could send you an email.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.480]   It's hard.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:08.480]   It's good that we got you on.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480]   Thank you for coming in.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.480]   Oh, Doctor, I saved the best for last.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480]   Yes.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.480]   Appreciate you being here.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.480]   Just remember, black doesn't crack.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   It doesn't.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480]   Black doesn't crack.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.980]   If you can hear the sound of my voice, please share this episode of One of Your Friends
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.480]   so we don't have to suffer alone.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.480]   Thank you.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   And we appreciate you.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.200]   Don't forget to tweet it, share it, email it.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.200]   Surprise email it to people.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200]   Don't tell them what it is.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.480]   Just watch their face after they open it and watch it and cry.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.480]   nipplehincher.com.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480]   Exactly.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.840]   That's a sign that I got to say.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:46.280]   Just follow me on Twitter and don't listen to old man.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.080]   Oh, Twitter handles.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.080]   Alexia.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.080]   I'm @Alexia.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.080]   That's good.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   I'm @Jolee.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.680]   Oh, you got the whole name.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.680]   Jolee.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:55.680]   Not just Jolee.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.680]   There couldn't have been another Jolee.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.680]   There is.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.680]   That's rude.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:46:59.680]   Attack her personal.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.680]   No, no, no.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.680]   Don't do that.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.680]   Hey, what ever happened?
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.680]   Did we, um, um, Lady Big Mac?
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:10.440]   Remember, we had everybody follow Lady Big Mac last week.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:14.880]   What is, I just curious, you know, she was the one, you know, the commentator.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   Twitter pundits.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.760]   Let me just see if Lady Big Mac went, because we had everybody, we asked everybody who was
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.880]   watching Twitter to follow her last week.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:26.320]   And her numbers went way up and we only see the end stop following her.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.960]   We doubled her numbers to 34, 84, but I also said stop following her.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:32.960]   But she's great.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.960]   Follow her.

[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960]   Nice person.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.800]   She's a wife, a mother, a grandmother and a NASCAR junkie.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.920]   So what could be wrong with that?
