[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.

[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.040]   There's lots to talk about, including the little-known
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.560]   origins of Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.760]   We'll talk about Amazon's amazing growth this year.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.440]   Comcast re-imposing internet caps, boo-hiss,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.840]   and a college student who created a massively popular tick
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.440]   talk about paint mixing and then got fired.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.720]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.960]   This week in Tech comes to you from Twit's LastPass Studios.

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.360]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.040]   the show we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   And I have assembled a fine panel of tech journalists
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   to help us dissect the week's news on the left here,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.120]   on my left, O.D.A.T.O.N. JJ Stone.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.640]   And really, the only reason you're here O.N.J.J. Stone
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.120]   this week is because you own a PS5.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480]   And I'm just so jealous.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.000]   One of the coveted few.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.600]   A few, the proud, the PlayStation 5 owners.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.320]   So it's great to have you also to my right.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.480]   Not politically, just-- well, maybe you're
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.440]   a little to my right politically.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.120]   Unlikely.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.800]   Unlikely.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.400]   But possible.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.080]   Possible.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   Mike, how do you write?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.640]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.080]   I don't know.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   He's back from--
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.640]   That was a thing that people who don't own PS5s.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.600]   You and I--
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.680]   I have a perspective.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.640]   Two out of the three.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.760]   Actually, Georgia Dow was scheduled to be here.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   She's low under the weather.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.360]   We hope she'll feel better soon.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.960]   I don't believe it's COVID.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.120]   I think it's a piece of bad turkey.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   Actually, no, she's Canadian.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   Their Thanksgiving was last month.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.360]   There's no excuse.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.240]   No excuse at all.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.320]   So you came back from Mexico.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.000]   You've been in Oaxaca for the last few months.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.120]   I've been watching your pictures of beautiful food
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.200]   and people and a beautiful city.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.680]   I'm so jealous.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.720]   What was the COVID situation down there, though?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.160]   I was worried it was amazing.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.560]   You know, it's like everybody's watching the distance
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.600]   and wearing masks.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.440]   And the great thing about Oaxaca--
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.000]   it felt like July.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.320]   It was summery.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.400]   All the restaurants have no roofs.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.960]   They're sort of like these little open area restaurants.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.360]   So you go through the door and you're like outside again
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.960]   in like a courtyard.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.160]   And the tables are all far apart.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.760]   And it's easy to maintain distance.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.400]   And we had an entire compound to ourselves.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.960]   And so we just didn't make physical contact with anybody.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.680]   And we did a lot of social things,
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   but everybody's super aware of it.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.720]   So it's just great.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.920]   And there are almost no cases in the city.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.760]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.520]   Mexico has been hard hit, I know.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.680]   Oh, Mexico certainly has.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.560]   But mostly northern Mexico, the indigenous areas
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   are super good.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.000]   So the indigenous groups sort of like wall it off
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.360]   and they govern it themselves and try
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.640]   to avoid people coming and going.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.880]   It's the tourists, of course.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.760]   It's the problem, isn't it?
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.720]   It is.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.160]   But Oaxaca is just so amazing and so much fun.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.720]   And it was a great place to shelter in place.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.880]   Unfortunately, we came back for the holidays
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.640]   and all that stuff.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.240]   Otherwise, we would have just stayed there.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.720]   Oh, beautiful.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.440]   A few Christmases ago spent the Christmas week at Porto
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.480]   Escondido, which is the province of Oaxaca,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.080]   but it's the ocean.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.400]   Beautiful area.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.200]   Really love it.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.600]   Sayolitas is there, the great surfing spot.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.160]   And we had it all to ourselves.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.280]   The beach was kind of empty until the day after Christmas.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.080]   And then 1,000 buses, full of OaxacaÃ±os,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.440]   came and basically moved in.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.720]   And apparently, the week after Christmas
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.960]   is the week not to be at the beach on the beach in Mexico.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   Because everybody--
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   Learned it the hard way.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.120]   Everybody came.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.160]   But I love it.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.520]   And the food is great in Oaxaca because it's South American.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.080]   A lot of fresh fish.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   Really amazing food.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.320]   And I'm sure your wife, Amira, went crazy
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.160]   because it's kind of her style of cooking.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.760]   Absolutely.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   And in fact, we spent day of the dead
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.840]   with an indigenous Zapoteca friend of ours,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   who we were the only foreigners within 150 miles.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.160]   And we just walked around their village.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.760]   And we did some cooking together.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.840]   We ate a lot of stuff.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.880]   We did all the day.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.560]   The dead stuff.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.440]   She ritually purified us within sense.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.240]   And it was amazing.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.040]   But the thing about Oaxaca state is
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   that 50% of the population is indigenous.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.280]   And so this is one of the reasons the food culture
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.320]   is so various and traditional.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.000]   They barely have bread.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.400]   They're super tortilla forward.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.360]   A lot of fresh stuff.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.880]   And in the case of our Zapoteca indigenous friend,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.560]   they literally grow or raise every bite they take.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.360]   Like everything.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.320]   They raise the animals.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.600]   They grow their own corn.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.640]   It's just an amazing food culture.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.840]   And then there's Owen J. J. Stone,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.200]   who spent Thanksgiving on his amazing 18 function grill,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   making barbecue.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   It looks like macaroni.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.600]   And what did you make here?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.200]   This looks so good.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.680]   It was great.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.920]   I put it on a smoker.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.240]   It took two hours, a hour to prep.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.440]   Hour in the smoker, we were eaten by one o'clock.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.120]   Then we got to eat a five o'clock.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.080]   Then we got to re-eat it.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.560]   Not quite.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.760]   It was amazing.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.080]   Because you put a turkey in there.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.160]   Turkey takes forever.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.760]   Yeah, this is turkey meatloaf.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   It looks like or something.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.920]   Turkey, yes.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   Yes.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   And the meatloaf.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.240]   Mac and cheese.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.400]   Oh, that looks good.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.040]   I'm like you guys.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.840]   I have enough in my house.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.160]   I forget what traveling's like.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.640]   I ventured to PA a couple times.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.960]   I was like in the homeless country,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.120]   the homeless market is better.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.440]   Other than that, y'all got up at 8 AM
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.120]   to put a turkey in the Traeger.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.800]   But it was really, really good.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.520]   It was best-- at least I said, that's
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.320]   only where we're going to do it from now on.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.480]   I was scared.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.440]   I had no time.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.760]   It was just-- I forget to be easy and fun.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   You did fine.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.640]   I also see, as I'm looking at your Insta, as the kids say,
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.280]   that you've been having some fun here with your miles
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.960]   Morales in your--
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.440]   I promise I'm paying attention to the show today.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.400]   I am.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.080]   I want to point you to an article, actually.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.800]   If I could, I would have bought anything.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.640]   An Xbox 3.6, a PS5, anything.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.360]   But scalpers and ONJJ Stone beat me to it.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   How'd you get one?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.800]   You want to know I was going to see
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.120]   I was going to hope you didn't ask me that,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   because it's going to make you really upset.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   Do you know how I got one?
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   How?
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.600]   The internet's game of America right now
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.680]   is for people that have a friend that works
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.520]   in a Best Buy or anywhere to get the PS5 off of a truck.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.840]   And now what they do is, all of your popular Instagrammers
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.160]   or Twitter people are raffling off playstations
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.560]   and things like that.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.080]   So I bought a raffle ticket for $25, and I want to--
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.880]   Oh, I'm going to kill you.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   Now this person I know for a fact,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.320]   because you can see what number order you're in.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.800]   They're making $4,500 per PS5.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.080]   They're making $5,000 per raffle.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.960]   That's why you can't get one though, because--
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.880]   That's why you can't get one.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.040]   It's scalpers.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.560]   This is the new scam right now.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.000]   The raffle thing is amazing.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.640]   Some people do it for $50, and they take less entries.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.680]   But it's more than eBay or anything else.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.560]   And you know what the cutest thing about that is?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.520]   On top of that scam, there's a double scam of,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.040]   if you just get one PS5, you take a picture of yourself with it,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.160]   you do the raffle.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.120]   If you have a big enough following, you make five grand,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.440]   then you just go buy one off of eBay for $1,000,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.080]   and have a drop ship to the winner.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.600]   So for $4,000, you never even touched a PS5,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.280]   or $3,000.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.840]   I'm just telling people this is a scam.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.800]   We have going on on a regular basis
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.280]   to give us the latest street scams.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.720]   Hey, look.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.240]   Scamazon-- I mean, I can tell you all about the scamazon scams,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   but this scam, $25, I was up in here like--
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.960]   You won though, so you're good.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.360]   I'm a lucky duck.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.640]   I kept-- Walmart says, Thursday,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.960]   we're going to get some at noon, or Target,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.120]   and I'm on there.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.200]   And everybody, I didn't go to Reddit every good--
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.520]   Thanks a lot, nothing for nothing.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.000]   Walmart, I don't know.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.160]   It's all right.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.120]   Every story gets two.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.360]   You can wait till after Christmas.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.240]   I want to be fine.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   Well, what I wanted it for--
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.720]   $4,000 off of eBay.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.560]   The hot game I think of the year, maybe of the decade,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.960]   a lot of times these overhyped hot games
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.720]   end up being terrible.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.520]   But I'm very excited about Cyberpunk 2077, starring Keanu
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.440]   Reeves.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.640]   But that's not what I'm excited about.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.960]   But it's coming out December 10.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.880]   And I'm going to play it not on a PlayStation 5, not
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.240]   on Xbox Series X. I'm going to play it on my new--
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.760]   my real pride enjoy my new Macintosh MacBook Pro 13.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.120]   How you may ask, Leo, how could you possibly play that game?
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.480]   It'll be interesting.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.920]   Oh, I'm doing an impression of how the game is going to look.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.120]   So it's Stadia.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.960]   It's the Google Stadia, which is their streaming game playing
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.320]   platform.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.840]   They are offering a pre-order of Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.160]   Chrome is native on the M1.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.840]   Chrome 87 has actually been compiled for Apple's platform.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.720]   And I'm hoping--
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.480]   I'm thinking I'm plugging into the ethernet.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   I've had gigabit service.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   Maybe this will be good.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.560]   I'm joking.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.480]   It'll be fine.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.080]   I mean, you'll just be a low grade fine.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.880]   But you'll be fine.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.600]   A low grade fine.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.480]   It's like, yeah, you better than nothing.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.720]   Look, you know, Owen, I'm just trying
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.280]   to make some lemonade out of this lemon.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.000]   I understand.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.040]   Cyberpunk.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.560]   Really interesting article.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.520]   I did not know this.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.560]   You probably did your serious gamer in the Atlantic this month
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.520]   about a guy named Mike Pondsmith, who
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   created Cyberpunk in 1988.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.480]   But he didn't write a novel.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.280]   He didn't write a book.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.360]   He wrote a bunch of games.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.400]   Role-playing games, Dungeons and Dragons type games.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.800]   There are now 50 books, more than 5,000 pages.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.320]   According to the Atlantic, it's one of the most extensively
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.760]   and fistidiously imagined worlds in fiction.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.400]   And it is the inspiration for Cyberpunk 2077, which I had no idea.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   I should have known.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.600]   Wait, what?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.560]   That's a thing?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.840]   That's a thing.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.120]   I've got a game, Uncle Leo.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.760]   I've got a game.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.720]   I've got it written out.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.200]   It's a book that's thick.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.640]   I've got sketches, layouts.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.680]   It's called Hustle World.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.960]   I'm about to go sell my book.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.040]   You need Hustle World.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.120]   If they can, oh man, I should know what, because I'm never going to do it.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.480]   And I don't know anybody.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.160]   So I just put it out there so somebody wants to contact me.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   Hustle World.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   It's hustle.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   It's huge.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.800]   You get to be a cop, so you go up through the police ranks, or you get to be a street
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.440]   person, you go up through the ranks.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.640]   And each place has a mafia.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.400]   And then the cops are trying to take down a mafia.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.560]   And then you can have people that are spies in the mafia.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.800]   Or you could go, if you're really smart, you send your kid to go work in a police force.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.120]   And then he helps you scam and get stuff in.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.080]   But it's a whole thing about hustling.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.400]   And you could either be on the good side or the bad side.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.560]   Sometimes you're corrupt on both ends.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.240]   Did you ever play tabletop games?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.440]   Did you ever do that, Mike, or did you ever do that?
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   I never did.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   I never did.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:38.680]   I mean, I gave up video games generally 20 years ago when I became a workaholic.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   But I...
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   That's a sad story.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   I'm seriously...
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.480]   I'm taking up video gaming now that I don't work much anymore.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.800]   Now that I'm a podcaster, I'll be playing more video games.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.720]   Cyberpunk 2077 looks like something that might bring me back in.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.600]   Especially since it will be available on the Mac that I'm going to be buying.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   So there you go.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.440]   I love the Cyberpunk genre.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.160]   Back in the 90s, I went super into the Cyberpunk music culture.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.440]   Back then it was like super raw.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   Like super, super raw.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.120]   And I used to love that stuff.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.760]   But I sort of moved on from that as well.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.960]   But I still love the whole Cyberpunk aesthetic.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.760]   And in fact, I really love...
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.160]   I'll admit it, the Cyberpunk subreddit.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.240]   Which is full of mostly fan-based imagery that's very cyberpunkish.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   And I also love...
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.880]   I think it was Mercedes or BMW.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.480]   One of the big motorcycle manufacturers just came out with a cyberpunk style scooter.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.240]   Which looks so cool.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.680]   Get ready because Cyberpunk is going to be this back baby.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.880]   Well, this is our world.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.120]   2020 is the most cyberpunk year ever.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   So...
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.600]   This is the subreddit you were talking about.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.920]   And for me it started with Neil Stevenson's Snow Crash.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.200]   Which has perhaps the best first chapter in science fiction history.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.360]   It goes downhill from there.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.800]   But it's got a great first chapter.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.360]   And I'm a huge Neil Stevenson fan, but even Neil Stevenson fan admits fans admit he has
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.840]   a hard time finishing stories.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.320]   And then of course, William Gibson's...
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320]   Neuro-Manser.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   Neuro-Manser is perhaps the pinnacle of Cyberpunk literature.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   1984.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Brilliant.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.720]   I believe it was written in your question.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   So this guy...
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.960]   I was behind back when ICQ was done.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   Back when ICQ...
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   ICQ.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   I used to play in his cup of games.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.440]   I was so deep in the fantasy.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   I was a vampire.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.040]   I was a war like I was a year.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.480]   Could you play ICQ, Dungeons & Dragons over ICQ?
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   I guess you could.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.960]   Like, not so much that, but you'd find friends that were into that.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.280]   And then that's what got me into it.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.840]   Because I was so much into the whole role-playing lore and worlds and stuff that people were
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   creating.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.520]   And I was like, "Oh, there's a game you could play."
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.600]   I'm like, "Well, what game is that?"
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.160]   This is the Cyberpunk 2077 phone from Oneplus.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.240]   Today I'm cracking open the cyberpunk.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   So it's an unboxing of the AT.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   I don't know what makes it so cyberpunk.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.040]   I don't know what makes it so cyberpunk.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.240]   So I suspect we're going to see, especially in this kind of dystopian world we live in
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.360]   now, a resurgence of cyberpunk over the next year.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   Get ready.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.240]   But you can trace it back to some degree to this guy.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   Let me read you this paragraph from this Atlantic profile.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:40.200]   Again, this is a black man named Mike Pondsmiths who wrote all this stuff.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.600]   Pondsmith, now in his 60s, has been known to wear his own cyberpunk uniform.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.960]   Black leather jacket, black jeans, motorcycle boots, mirror shades.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.440]   That's kind of the thing.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   Classic.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   Classic.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   Today at home--
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   And a Japanese sword.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   [laughs]
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.720]   Today at home in the suburbs of Seattle, he's in a black t-shirt and regular spectacles.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.080]   Just fitting we're speaking over Zoom, the kind of now ubiquitous telepresence technology
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.240]   that felt futuristic in Blade Runner in 1982.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.120]   But here's the quote.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.520]   Writing Pondsmith tells me, "It's a lot like basically eating a pound of dough, a whole
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.080]   pepperoni, a couple of pounds of mozzarella and a bunch of spices that are throwing up
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   a pizza."
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.560]   He's right.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.880]   I've literally done that.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.400]   His UVRA, which is, again, tabletop D&D gaming, is published by a company called All Our
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.480]   Talsorian Games.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:43.760]   And a Polish video game developer, CD Projekt Red, contacted them in 2012 about adopting
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.880]   the cyberpunk D&D games for this game, Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:57.240]   So I thought it'd be worth mentioning this guy Pondsmith because he deserves credit
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:03.600]   for what we're all about to enjoy, me in 12 frames per second, Splendor.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   I'm totally joking.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   I don't want Apple fan to hate on me.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   It's going to be good.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.440]   Well, I think it's a good test.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.400]   I put on a Google Nest or anything like that.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.640]   If you're putting on a new little Google stream and then we'd have a problem.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.280]   So I got my M1 on Tuesday or Monday, Monday, I guess, so I've had it for a little less
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.400]   than a week.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.160]   I got the MacBook Pro 13-inch maxed out, 16 gigs.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.480]   That's all you can get at the top, 2TB SSD.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   It's fast.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   It's really fast.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.840]   As long as you're running, well, it's fast is if you can run native apps and those are
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.080]   few and far between app.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.200]   All of Apple's stuff is updated.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:49.720]   And then the hardcore Apple developers, people like Cable Sasser at Panic software, are quickly
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.120]   pushing out M1 universal binaries.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.760]   I think the terminal program I use is.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.520]   So there's that layer of, yeah, these are optimized for it.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.720]   Really, I mean, they launch instantly.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.000]   Microsoft Office, the beta is available.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.240]   I think Microsoft is never going to do anything too snappy on a Mac platform, but it's available.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.280]   And then there's a second layer, which is stuff that is running an emulation under Rosetta
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   2.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.760]   And when you've run your first Rosetta 2 x86 application, it installs Rosetta.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   It takes a while.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.920]   The first time any application runs, it cranks through it so that it can do a just-in-time,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   actually, it's not just an advanced compilation of some of it, so it'll run faster.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.640]   This only happens once at the beginning.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.920]   Those run pretty well.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.360]   What people don't talk about, you were talking, oh, and about the fact that there's no discrete
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:51.520]   GPU, there's no, it doesn't have ray tracing, it doesn't have a Xeon with 18 cores or anything.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   But for what it is, it's extremely snappy.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.440]   For what it is, it is amazing.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.800]   What the hell is that on your forehead?
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   Is that an Apple?
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.440]   It's my Apple sticker.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.800]   I have a notch haircut, but I'm covering it up with my bangs.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.240]   I bought a Mac Mini, mine comes in January.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   Oh, good.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Oh, good.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   Oh, I'm absolutely going to love it.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.160]   Like I said, I do a lot of quick edits from my R5 on my Pro, actually, so one of my Pros
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.320]   to buy the Mac Mini because I have two Pros, I don't need two Pro's.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.120]   We should say iPad Pro, so that's-
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   iPad Pro, yes.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.320]   That is the prototype A14 chip for the M1 that was running in the desk.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.080]   And it was one of the first things that I could put my AK on, not raw, but I could put AK on
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.000]   from my camera and just like how people show you in their little YouTube videos.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.600]   It just streams and it plays the minor stutter, whereas my beast machine, I had to run proxies
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.480]   to run the AK raw.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.120]   So I was already impressed with that.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.560]   And once it dropped, I was like, all right, I know I have to get one.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.160]   Again to what I said earlier before we started to show, not for like movie making stuff,
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.080]   but for regular people, for YouTube people, for like on a budget people, this thing is
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   game changing.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.280]   Like for, if you can sell it in a hundred bucks, you can get the base model of a mini and you
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.120]   could be in there like swimwear without headaches and processing power or editing, just editing
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.720]   videos alone part of it is amazing.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.280]   And if you're a photographer, you make audio, it's just going to be, this is butter.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.680]   Like they're, they've created a huge problem in the market.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:28.360]   If you are using kind of mainstream apps, especially if you're a Mac, you know, hardcore
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.480]   Mac guy and using gal, using Mac apps, it is, you're going to love it.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.400]   You're going to love it.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.160]   It's going to be, I think it's so one of the things I expected to really love it.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.880]   I've been one of those people saying this is a revolution.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.480]   I still think it is.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.760]   And you know, Owen, when you get to the M2 or the rumored M1 X with a 16 inch MacBook
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.680]   Pro and the M2 next year or three, and you're having many more cores and many more GPU, you're
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.760]   going to, you're going to really see some amazing stuff.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.840]   This is clearly a family that has a lot of headroom, a lot of room for growth.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   Yes.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.760]   And it's going to rapidly outpace what is now a 30 year old architecture, the X86 architecture.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.080]   So we can say that, but there are going to be some growing pains.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.720]   And I was, I'm actually a little bit less excited about it now that I have one because
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   of two things.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.840]   One, it's going to be a, for some reason, it's going to be a while before a lot of the
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.760]   edge case tools even work.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.920]   I was surprised at how few development tools I use don't even run.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.000]   List won't run.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.480]   I just now got a development version of Emacs that works.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.080]   And if that's fully native, I use a tool called racket doesn't work.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   A lot of stuff just won't run.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.400]   And I think it's not merely that it's arm architecture because most open source tools
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.560]   have an arm version.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:58.400]   People has taken this opportunity to super lock down the Macintosh.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.360]   And I think this is actually going to be a bit of an issue going forward.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.840]   It is not an open platform anymore.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.280]   They asked Linus Torvalds, what do you think of the new M1, the creator of Linux?
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.160]   I'd love to run Linux on it.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.720]   I'm guessing we will never get it running on it because of Apple's T2 chip at security.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:25.480]   The way they're locking this thing down, it is kind of hostile to, I think, to outside
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   developers.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.000]   They're bridge.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.640]   You could see it coming from the fact that the way the phones work with the App Store,
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.200]   that they want everything to work in an App Store environment.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.160]   And this is the final countdown for that to start happening to where they can say, okay,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.440]   you want to come back in and play?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   These are the new rules.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.480]   It's a walled garden.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.920]   And I mean, before you didn't have that issue because it was Intel, but now they really
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   could say, yes, no, yes, no.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.440]   And they're probably going to slow roll that too because they want to wait until they get
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.960]   more better processors and things like that out into the market.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.320]   So again, we've been having issues over the last, like what, two years?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.280]   So people want to sue Apple and have the ratios change, the percentages change.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:12.160]   I can only see this getting worse for them as some kind of quasi-monopoly in this market
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.320]   for what they're allowing on their systems.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:22.280]   And I feel like I read, it's got a future hands-on Mac episode, but I read, speaking of Neil
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.800]   Stevenson, he wrote a wonderful book about 30, 20 or 30 years ago, I guess 20 years ago,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.160]   called In the Beginning There Was The Command Line.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.720]   And he talks about Windows and Macintosh and Linux.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.880]   He actually mentions BOS, so that dates it.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:44.520]   But one of the things he says is, he said, imagine of crossroads with four car dealerships.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.600]   There's the car dealership that's making bicycles basically.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.560]   And then across the street, along comes this dealership, that's Windows.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.480]   The long comes this dealership, actually that's DOS.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.720]   The dealership across the street that's making these very sleek automobiles, they're kind
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.000]   of futuristic.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.040]   The DOS guys look across the street and say, "Uh oh."
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   And they make a moped.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.960]   They put an engine on the bicycle.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   And they say, "See?"
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   And it's slowly gotten better.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.120]   And now it's kind of a family station wagon, but it breaks down a lot.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.440]   It needs a lot of gas.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.640]   It's burning oil.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.760]   Meanwhile, across the street, you've got these snooty people using these very slick, high-performance,
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.040]   kind of closed universe things.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.600]   And then there's a bunch of hippies in yurts and tents who are building Linux, and they're
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.080]   making these amazing RVs and they're putting them on the side of the road saying, "They're
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   free.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   Come get them.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   They're free.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   They work really well.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080]   They're open.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   They're free."
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.720]   I want to go buy a station wagon or one of these.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.120]   He says later he said, "Oh, actually the Mac isn't so bad.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.200]   I'm starting to like it."
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.720]   But I think actually that that future that he described is becoming more and more real,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.200]   that we're now seeing three distinct paths.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.480]   I've talked a little bit about this before, but now having used the M1 for a week, I have
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.040]   a much clearer vision of Microsoft's really doesn't care what you use.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:15.520]   They're going to virtualize Windows, Windows Virtual Desktop with the very bad acronym WVD
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.680]   is coming next year.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.760]   And that's what I think a lot of businesses will end up using with some sort of cheap,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.280]   thin client.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.680]   Kind of like Stadia, but not for games for business software.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.240]   Apple's making what is essentially an appliance play.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.960]   Just like the phone, just like the iPad, their computers are going to be appliances.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   They'll work great.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.480]   They'll be secure and as long as you don't want to deviate that command line, that whole
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.200]   Unix thing.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.920]   And then there's going to be these funky ass Linux machines that will maybe run on, some
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.120]   people are speculating maybe Qualcomm look across the street and say, "Oh, we could do
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:55.080]   that," and make something like the M1 because they've always focused on low power over
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   performance.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   But essentially Linux is going to be the last bastion of the hippie, the open source,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.280]   the freedom developer, because Apple's going to just lock it down more and more.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.240]   And that concerns me, frankly.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:15.000]   I'm still living in this thread ripper, 3,900, 128 gigs of RAM.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.520]   But you're still using Windows.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   Oh, no.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   No.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.200]   I mean, again, two years ago, I switched back to Windows because she just was looking better
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.520]   and I'm not going to switch back to Apple until Apple M2.78 blows my brain out.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:37.320]   Because again, right now, proxies or whatever, I can render five or 10 lines of 4K and 8K
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.400]   and I can sit here and work on my machine.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.920]   I can't do it these M1s yet.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.520]   I don't care what nobody says.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.560]   So the future cool, but right now I love the fact that I got all this RAM in here.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.880]   This thing cost me under $2,500, the price point of what it is for what I need to do.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   And guess what?
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   I got all the apps I want.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.720]   And as long as you live in the app that you need, you probably don't care that Windows
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.600]   is a piece of junk because it gets the job done and you're not living in Windows.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.080]   Don't stop it.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.280]   Don't you disrespect it.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   It's a piece of junk.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.680]   It is not a piece of junk, OK?
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.240]   First of all, like, do you want to break us up here?
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.520]   You used to edit Windows magazine, didn't you?
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   And it was a piece of junk.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   It still is a piece of junk.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.920]   It's getting worse.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.920]   Go ahead, Owen.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.560]   Defend your piece of junk.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.360]   Hey, I got Corsair Sexy Lights.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.000]   I got 128 gig.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   I'm gonna need a record.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I got thread ripper process.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.320]   I got more hard drive space than the Lord allows, OK?
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   And this thing is a piece.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.080]   I got over a million photos on my computer.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.240]   You know how much it costs me to do that on Apple?
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   $19,000 because they charge a tense shut up.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.400]   You basically have the hubcap spinner hubcap of computers.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.800]   Admit it.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.560]   You are so disrespectful.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.560]   Admit it.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.120]   You're about to go cyberpunk out, probably your way to a video game and talking about what
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   I got over here.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.280]   OK, I can run non-Minecraft servers on this thing.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.560]   I can take over the world.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   All right.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.560]   Go ahead with your little M1.1.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.560]   Carby with his M3.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   Then we'll be talking.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   Then you can call my computer piece of junk.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.960]   But now, same sees, same sees.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.560]   Yeah, you're not going to the dark side yet.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.400]   So I mean, I don't think, I mean, Leo, you said,
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.000]   you found it disconcerting that the hippies are getting even more open.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   No, that's good.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Mac is coming.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   That's good.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.640]   That the world's divided even further than it used to be.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   Yes.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.960]   But I don't think that's disconcerting at all.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.080]   I think that, you know, for the vast majority of people, of course, it's going to be computing
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   in general.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.600]   The experience is going to be an appliance experience.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.160]   They don't care about the M1.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.440]   They don't care about the details.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.720]   Just they want to do everything that they want to do and they don't want to think about
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   even further.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   Then there are two kinds of power users.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.920]   There's the super technical.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.520]   I want to build everything, do everything from scratch, understand everything, control
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.160]   and customize everything.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.320]   Those people will be on Linux.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.880]   And then there are the power-hungry maniacs like Owen who just want, they're just drunk
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.840]   with power and they need like, you know, terabytes of storage and massive quantities
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.720]   of anything they want and don't want to be stopped.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.920]   And I actually think it's kind of a beautiful thing that we have at least three options
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.840]   generally for different personality types, different work styles, different types of
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.080]   people.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.320]   And I just think it's a beautiful thing.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.560]   I will say though, as a Chromebook user and a Chromebook user, which I'm going to move
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:46.320]   to Apple, next move is going to be to an Apple laptop.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.840]   I think it's gotten to the point where the Pixelbook and the Chromebook, the high-end
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:55.400]   Chromebooks, this is one of the best places to run Linux these days.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   I agree.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.600]   Actually, Owen might make the case that Windows is a pretty good place to run Linux these
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   days with WSL.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   It is.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.960]   I mean, if you want to overkill, but I mean, I just read options, okay?
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.680]   You think Apple's cool until Apple locks everything down and you're paying like, you
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   know, I'm not going to do that.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   And I'm concerned about that.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   I agree.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   That's a problem.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   I mean, oh, you want to click here?
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   It's going to be two cents.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   It's two cents per click every time you click.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   Like, I don't know what are you going to do.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   Like, I don't know.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.360]   It just seems like really fishy to wait a dose of it.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.080]   I'm still, I'm just waiting for the day to my daughter graduate so I get out of this
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   ecosystem.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   Oh, is that the only reason you have an iPhone is because of your daughter?
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.280]   If I didn't need to track my child 24/7, 365, no doubt.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.640]   If Sam's son or anybody else offered the same ubiquitous, like, I can just know where
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.400]   my child is at all times.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.000]   You can't do that on Android device.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.800]   You got to pay is glitchy.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   It don't work like that.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.440]   That is one thing about the garden.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.440]   It just works.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.440]   It does work.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440]   I'm texting her.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440]   She says, I just see the text.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   I'm like, it came on your iPad.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.400]   It came on your MacBook, bro.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   It came on your phone.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.920]   I mean, watch, bring.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.400]   How did you not see my text?
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   What do you mean?
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   You didn't see it.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.720]   So that's the lifestyle I'm living.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.960]   As soon as you graduate, I'll get out of it.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.400]   But right now, your daughter can't wait to move to Android.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   She writes.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.120]   She's like, yeah, that's a good reason.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   I'm out.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   That's a good reason.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.480]   By the way, thank you.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.840]   Your daughter sent us some lovely soap.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   I really appreciate it.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   It smells great.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   Absolutely.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   You take it personally, Leo.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   He's not anything.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   Well, okay.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.920]   I'm just going to say some of the flavors are a little odd.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   She's 13.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.360]   So she likes coffee.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.080]   So there's a coffee soap that gets you woke up in the morning.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   There's a cat of caffeine.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.720]   Yeah, no, I mean, I don't know what it does for you.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   I'm just saying it.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   She should put a little caffeine in it.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.440]   It would, of course, have no effect.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.120]   But people would get excited to buy it.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.920]   You don't you want to over promise an under delivery.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.560]   So I'm saying you just say it's a coffee.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.560]   And then she got one to something like Captain Crunch.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.480]   I mean, you might feel like you're in a bowl of cereal where you're taking a shower, but
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.480]   it is a delicious shower.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   None of that.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.760]   And that Captain Crunch like is very exfoliant.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   It's good.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   It smells good.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.400]   Does it have Captain Crunch in it?
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.800]   It might again, it might add a little gold flex.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.640]   So I don't know if you saw it or anything.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   I did see it.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.640]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.520]   Where can we get where can we get these soaps to get some money, but you might get a little
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.040]   something out of there, you know, I want to give her a plug at the top of the show.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.880]   We normally save it for the bottom of the show.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.680]   Where can we get her fabulous soaps?
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.080]   I'm Gene Queen dot com or leah.com.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.120]   L E I Y A H dot com.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   She's iron.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.720]   Oh, oh, and I'm selling beard oil to now.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.160]   If you want a beard to look luxurious like my, she's allowed me to sell beard oil and
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.560]   I got, I'm going to probably go make us a beer bomb a beer.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   I'm assuming.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.040]   By the way, this is her personal site.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.480]   This is so do baby sitting.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Well, cool.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   Cool.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   She gets back.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   She certified.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.320]   You know, she certified in case you want to take her on one of the trips on Gileo and watch
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   one of the kids.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.040]   She's younger than your kids, but she's responsible.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.520]   Oh, I just love her.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   She is such an inspiration.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:17.480]   And I just want to say if you want to get some delicious soap or even some beard oil,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   you get in the business too.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   Huh?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   That's good.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.480]   There is the crunchberry.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.920]   There's the crunchberry soap.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.600]   Queen of Shiba a K lavender smoke.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.040]   She's really doing some interesting stuff.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   What flavor is the pan?
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   That does not caffeine.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   It does.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   It looks like it does.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.920]   Let's spread a little crack on top.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.640]   We use a panda to get that.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.480]   You don't really know what she's doing, do you?
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.680]   And she's over there in the room.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   She's making this stuff.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.480]   You don't have no idea.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.960]   She makes her decisions.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.080]   At first, like she makes you grow pictures for her products.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.320]   I was like, I could do it.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.880]   Like I got like a good I could see that.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   Let me do it.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.320]   So after the new year, we're going to be doing some more promotional stuff.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.800]   She's going to let me help her, but she's been wanting to do it on her own.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   And that's fine.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   Hell yeah.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:07.640]   H-I-G-I-E-N-E queen or everything spelled weird.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.840]   So it may be easier to go to leiyah.com.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   That's right.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   Good for that.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.800]   Sell a lot of soap, Leah.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   You rock.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   It's the best.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Hey, you know what?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.720]   When you have a kid that's like a nerd and she's in the tech stuff and she's like in quarantine,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.200]   she's like, dad, I got to wash my hands all the time.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   My hands are getting raw.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Can I make soap?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   And I'm like, sure.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.440]   I spent $50 on a soap.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.240]   She's like, you think I can sell soap?
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.000]   I invested $400.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.400]   She sold it to her friends.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   She bought more soap.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.880]   And now I made her website because she was into it.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.680]   And it's good that, you know, during this time, you know, she's the only child that
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.320]   he gave her something to do.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.960]   You know, she takes it seriously.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   She likes it.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   So great.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   It's good.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.600]   I particularly enjoy the King James II manly soap.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.200]   It's a mix of Lebben, Bergamo, Coolment, Lavender, Greenacord, Sandalwood, Cedarwood,
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.080]   Amber and Musk.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.400]   She says it smells just like walking into a barbershop.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:10.080]   And it has organic Irish CMOS and activated bamboo charcoal in it.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.560]   It's healthy.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.480]   It is actually a fabulous soap.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.240]   It like again, and I don't want to go to show with that stuff because I thought the soap
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   was all the same, right?
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   Because I'm a guy.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   I don't care.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.800]   I get out and I was actually after I get out.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.280]   I'm like, okay, I put this soap on and my skin is actually moist.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.600]   I was like, oh, there's actually a difference in soap when you buy.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.040]   Because I thought women just spent $8,000 on a bar of soap for fun because they were
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   nuts.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   I didn't.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.560]   Anyway, Leah, thank you for the soap and I appreciate it.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.800]   And it really is good soap.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.280]   So there you go.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.000]   That's your first free commercial, Leah.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   From now on, we got to pay.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.120]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.560]   I don't know what to make of this story at all.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.600]   Apple's head of global security, you'd think a guy would be pretty buttoned down.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:08.920]   It has been indicted indicted by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department, the California
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.840]   court has indicted Thomas Moyer.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:19.400]   He's accused of offering iPads to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office in exchange for
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.120]   concealed carry permits for four Apple employees.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:29.560]   And in a famous iPad for concealed carry trade.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.400]   I love this story because it lends itself to such delicious tabloid headlines.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   No kidding.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.240]   Apple busted in guns for iPad scheme.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.480]   It's just so fun.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.720]   But basically the details are less salacious than that.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.840]   I mean, it still appears to be criminality.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.440]   But apparently there are a couple of people in the Sheriff's office.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.560]   Of course, in California, sheriffs get to decide who gets gun permits of various types.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.200]   And they have wide discretion.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.800]   There are some counties you cannot get a gun at all.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.960]   These guys were apparently using their ability to withhold permits to get little benefits
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.000]   for the department.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.600]   And they, when Apple came to get four gun permits, they basically said, well, if you
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.480]   want those permits, we'd really love some iPads.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.400]   And so Apple, you know, so they said, you know, we'd love essentially.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   $70,000 worth of iPads for you to get four concealed carry permits for security guards
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.000]   at Apple.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.280]   And it appears to be that Apple may have said, okay.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.960]   And before the deal went down, the Sheriff's office found out that there were, you know,
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.080]   the search warrants to pursue this criminal charge.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.920]   But it's really, I don't think this isn't a matter of Apple's head of security going
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.120]   to the sheriff and say, hey, how about a how about some iPads for some?
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.000]   No, it was the impetus was the Sheriff's office, which was demanding this in exchange for something
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.320]   that Apple felt like they really needed.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:11.520]   In a, you know, security for big tech companies, I think, what is it?
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.880]   Zuckerberg, Facebook spends millions of dollars a year just on Mark Zuckerberg's personal
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   security.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.440]   A few iPads, a big deal, right?
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.520]   Apple says after learning the allegations, we conducted a thorough internal investigation
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.280]   and found no wrongdoing.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:38.160]   We should point out that Laurie Smith, who is the sheriff, has been accused in the past
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.560]   of deliberately withholding permits to carry concealed weapons until applicants did favors
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.520]   for her.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.800]   The local NBC affiliate did an investigation in June that found donors to Smith's reelection
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.120]   campaign were 14 times more likely to get concealed carry permits than those who didn't
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.440]   donate.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.320]   So this sounds like a long time little shakedown.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.440]   I mean, they police themselves, Mike.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   So I'm not worried about it.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.760]   I mean, and not for nothing.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.000]   If anybody can really look into something, it's Apple.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.040]   Like when Apple wants to look into something, they don't check text messages.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.280]   They got to record a phone call.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   They got everything.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   They got GPS data location.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.160]   How long did you spend in their office?
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.560]   You couldn't have put that deal together.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.920]   Three point five minutes.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.560]   So we know that you didn't do it.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.240]   But that kind of thing, I'm from the East Coast.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.680]   So New York, you hear about this kind of stuff all the time around carry concealed permits.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.560]   So there's always hand shaking in other terms.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.200]   I won't reference the sound horrible.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.360]   There's something to it.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:44.560]   It was a plot point in in in billions in the TV show billions exactly in New York.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.200]   I feel like Apple was like that what you're asking is too high.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.600]   And then we're like, Oh, you don't want to you don't pay that price?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.800]   Well, now we're going to rock you up for a scam.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   I feel like that's more than so what happened than anything else.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.320]   Because this kind of thing happens all the time.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   They met at a Jamba Juice.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.680]   That's something that doesn't happen too much in New York.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.200]   No, that's only in Suggah Valley.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.240]   Do you want to discuss guns?
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.440]   Meet me at the Jamba Juice.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.920]   Yes.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.400]   So Moyers indicted.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.840]   Is the sheriff also indicted?
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   Yeah, two officials.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.320]   No, not yet.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.600]   Two officials in the office were indicted, not Lori.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.400]   Her son, Lori Smith herself.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.840]   They're still looking into her.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   So there are two officials.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.560]   Not a case of soliciting a bribe.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.200]   So yeah, we'll see what happens here.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.160]   But now that we know the whole story, it is a great tabloid headline.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.600]   But now that we know the story, maybe it's a little bit less.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   Yep.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.520]   Let's take a little break.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.320]   There is a lot more to talk about.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.480]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.520]   Oh, doctor is with us.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.120]   I wish you'd brought some of your mac and cheese.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   Go ahead.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   Go ahead.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.840]   How come I will I will bring you some.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.440]   I think that's what I can do in the world.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.920]   Oh, it looks so good.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920]   No doubt.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   Seven cheeses.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   Seven.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   Seven.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.920]   Why seven?
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   Wouldn't one be enough?
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.360]   You know, like anything, you know, you start off with an M1 chip and then at some point you
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   evolve, baby.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.360]   You got the M7 cheeses.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   M7 cheeses.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   You have a max.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   Max.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360]   Max.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   We are.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.880]   It's a seven cheese processor.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.880]   All right.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.680]   Also with us, he's a pretty darn good cook.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:33.040]   Good cook himself, Mr. Mike Elgin from ELGAN.com.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   Yes.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.880]   And since we gave Leah a big plug, we'll give your son a big plug for his wonderful, his
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880]   little enterprise.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:45.960]   And my son has a has a real deal and special for your audience.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   Oh, stay tuned.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.880]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.320]   Our show today brought to you by Barracuda.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   You know the name Barracuda.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.680]   I mean, they're probably the best known name in enterprise-grade security solutions protecting
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.040]   email networks, data, applications.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.720]   And now more than ever, you need Barracuda's total email protection.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.920]   Did you know that 91% of all cyber attacks start?
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.720]   It's very simple with an email.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.520]   It can kill you spearfishing ransomware account takeover conversation hijacking.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:27.320]   You've got employees at home, no longer protected by the umbrella of protection at your work.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.920]   They're opening those emails.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.880]   One wrong click can cost you money, customers, your reputation.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.160]   And by the way, of course, the scammers are jumping on whatever's going on.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:48.480]   Barracuda's researchers have observed as an example a spike, a 667% spike in coronavirus
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.760]   related spearfishing attacks.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   Since this began at the beginning of the year, they impersonate groups like the World Health
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   Organization.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.680]   They use domain spoofing.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.360]   They promise information or training related to the coronavirus.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.160]   It's all about tricking your employees into clicking that email.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:12.400]   Units why you need Barracuda total email protection includes all in one email security, backup
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.560]   and archiving for your Office 365 account.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.320]   AI based protection, it's important because the hackers aren't sitting still.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.160]   They've got new scams every single day.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.720]   So you've got to have protection that gets smarter and better every single time.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.360]   It'll protect you from spearfishing account takeover and business email compromise.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.920]   They have an automated incident response that gives you options so you can quickly and
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.800]   efficiently address the attacks.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   That's important.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:43.240]   The faster you act, the more effectively you act, the more you can limit the damage.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.440]   And they even have security awareness trainings for your employees so they can be in the first
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.320]   line of defense.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.120]   Ensure the safety and security of your business.

[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.240]   And maybe it's a little scary to even think about this, but honestly you need to know
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.880]   what's in that inbox.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.240]   Go to barracuda.com/twit for that free threat scan of your business.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.400]   Barracuda, B-A-R-R-A-C-U-D-A.com/twit.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.320]   You know the name Barracuda, your journey secured.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.000]   Thank you Barracuda for supporting this week in tech.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:30.240]   Thank you for supporting Twit by going to that address barracuda.com/twit.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.280]   Just to wet your whistle a little bit.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:40.160]   And it's just a rumor, but Ming Chiquo, who is the supply chain rumor guy, everybody's
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.560]   using this Greg Federighi picture of him staring at the close laptop.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   It's so scary.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   We're not pitching.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.520]   Find somebody who looks at you like this guy looks at a MacBook.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.880]   Yeah, baby.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   They must have known.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.360]   I mean he posed, they must have known, Apple knew that this would be, you know, you'd
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.920]   see this image everywhere.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:09.360]   According to Ming Chiquo, Apple is already working on next generation laptops with new
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.640]   all new design for the second half of 2021.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:22.800]   We've also seen murmurs that'll be a 16 inch M1X with maybe 16 cores, maybe even more cores.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.920]   So Apple is not going to sit still on this one.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.640]   And I have to say that my experience and the experience of everybody's reviewing these
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:35.960]   things is it's very impressive with what Apple has done it with a first generation chip.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.840]   And what the thing to watch before you go buy one is are the tools you use going to
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.080]   be native.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.360]   If they are, you're going to have an amazing experience.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.720]   That's what I think.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:55.880]   Apple is talking to Foxconn and others, Pegatron, another supplier about moving production out
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.360]   of China as China gets more uncertain as the trade war goes on.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:07.720]   And in fact, a Biden presidency will not change that according to Bloomberg.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:17.040]   They're talking about moving to anywhere but China's, India, Southeast Asia, the Americas,
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:22.000]   Hong Kong, apparently because not only politics, but also China's getting more expensive.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Maybe that's tariffs, but Vietnam and India are proving competitiveness.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.440]   I wonder if they would look at opening plants in the US.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440]   I really do.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.320]   I don't know why they're down.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.000]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.640]   So first of all, this is part of a longer trend that's been accelerated by the coronavirus.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.120]   People are realizing that consolidating everything in one country is super risky and that you
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.760]   want not just to get out of China, but to be in multiple locations.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   Diversify.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   Exactly.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   It's a little more expensive.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.240]   But one of the reasons China's getting more expensive is simply because there is a saturation
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   among their workforce.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.080]   It's actually difficult now.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.080]   The higher qualified people in China.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.480]   And so the wages are going up in China.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:11.000]   China is emerging as an economic power and wages go up.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.640]   So this is just part of the normal.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.920]   This is one of the beautiful things about capitalism.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.560]   It takes a very poor country, raises them up, and then feeds a lot more people.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:25.600]   And then they move out because they have all and then they become consultants or whatever.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.800]   You talk about the Americas specifically.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.040]   The two most likely places in the Americas are Brazil and Mexico.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.000]   Great places for manufacturing.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.560]   The United States is a horrible place for manufacturing.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:44.640]   Americans make way too much money and are way too entitled to do this kind of factory
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   work.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.360]   I mean, you have to be, you have to have a super motivated and yet super educated and yet
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:56.600]   relatively low paid workforce in order to do the kind of factory work that China set
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.200]   the mold for.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.400]   And Americans just don't want to do that stuff.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.120]   They just want to get paid for it.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   They just want to get paid for it.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:09.520]   Well, that kind of stuff makes me really mad because they want to pay these people nothing
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.320]   and have to put nets up on their buildings.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.960]   People don't jump out of their windows making nikes and phones and all this kind of stuff,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.960]   paying them nothingness.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   So let's move to another country where people have nothing, work them to the bone and give
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   them nothing.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.880]   So we would do the work here.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.600]   People used to build cars here and build everything here.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.840]   But we all care about our environment.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.720]   We care about the waste that goes into our water system and how our kids are going to
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   survive.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.240]   But we're sure happy to go send it off to China, fog up their things, have them wear
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.040]   a mask, 10 years before everybody else, and now move it on down to another country.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.960]   So I mean, this is grand scope on this whole Americans don't want to do the job thing.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   We want to do the job.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   We want it done properly.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.160]   We want it done right for the ecosystem.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.480]   And we want to get paid for that money because you know, we got to have the profits.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.360]   This shoe only cost you $13 Nike but sold and shipped.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.200]   But we only paid the person 30 cents a day.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.920]   Now we're going to sell this shoe for $250.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.000]   Hopefully hit the opposite market and goes for $1000.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.680]   So again, I'll shut up again, but that's what we do.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:16.920]   Well, I will hold the line on environmental impact, but I think Americans understand that
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.240]   a product made in America might cost a little bit more.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.680]   You think Americans are unwilling to pay it?
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Is it our fault?
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   It's all in fault.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   It's all in fault.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   It's all in fault.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   Why?
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   The profit.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:33.480]   I guess you won't even buy a Mac that is already made with sweatshop labor at minimum
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   cost.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   You won't even pay that price.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:40.040]   The way do you buy that MacBook Pro that's made in California?
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.960]   It's cost you $5 an hour.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.080]   If I was paid a better living wage, it'd be easier for me to afford the hike that's
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.600]   going to come up on this also.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.640]   The fact that wages haven't gone up in the last 20 years and people are fighting and
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.760]   complaining about that, keeping most average Americans in poverty, making another $34,000
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   a year is a problem.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.040]   Buying this phone is not the issue.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.280]   I could buy this phone all day.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.320]   My daughter's got an iPhone 11 Pro 256 gig.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.920]   I dropped $1300 on my kit.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.120]   So a lot of people can afford a phone, a one time purchase.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.400]   But if you're making more money, you could afford the cost it would uptake for that.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.280]   If you didn't have to have the greed and the money you're making.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.640]   Bezos out here in the pandemic making a billion dollars won't give people two weeks sickly
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   when they get corona.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.360]   So it runs rampant through their system.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.600]   You're going to get somebody a $300 bonus.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.760]   You could give somebody $1,000 or $10,000.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.800]   It wouldn't hurt your bottom line one bit.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.000]   Your wife took half and you're still out here balling, but it's not about that.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   It's not about taking care of people, it's about greed and profits and stocks.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.920]   So again, America would do the job if we were properly paid for the job and the job was
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   done the right way.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:42.600]   But we have politicians, we have people staying money, the hide their money overseas.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   They don't even want to pay taxes.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.000]   There's a whole other issue besides America's not wanting to do a job that they should do
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.280]   if they got paid properly for it.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.800]   There's an advantage also in China.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.120]   Part of it is that the Chinese workers get $100 a week.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.280]   So that's certainly a part of it.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:03.360]   There's also an advantage because you've got areas where everything is made.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.800]   It's quick to ship.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.960]   You could do just in time production.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.840]   They've created regions.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:15.200]   In other words, there's a logistic advantage to manufacturing in China.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.320]   That's why I find it interesting that Wistron, Pegatron, Foxconn, they're all thinking about
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.080]   moving out of China because a lot of the suppliers are still going to be in China.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   I guess they're also in Taiwan and they're also in Korea.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.640]   That's part of it.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:34.120]   There was a study, I think a year ago or two years ago, that said a made an America iPhone
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.760]   would cost $2,000.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.600]   So $1,500 more?
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.560]   Yeah, $500 more.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.920]   $900, yeah.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.120]   More $900.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.560]   This is from a while ago.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.640]   So Tim Behren did the estimate.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:56.360]   To my point, if I was making better money, a $500 hike or $1,000 hike wouldn't matter
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.200]   because my wits would go up.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.920]   So again, it's always the thing of, I'm a small business owner.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.440]   So I know the complaint of not wanting to pay people and the product you could pay people.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.280]   So I do know there's a threshold for that, but it's really the biggest scam in the world
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.080]   to act like you can't afford to pay people.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.920]   And all the prices where everything's going to go up.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.720]   Yeah, but your wages went up, bro.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   Well, like, $5,000.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   They lose.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.920]   The question, I don't think the question is if you can afford to pay people a certain
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.520]   amount, there has to be a motivation to do it.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.040]   So if you're a company competing with other companies and you have the choice to have something
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.720]   manufactured in China, like everything is manufactured in China or manufactured in
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.320]   the United States, you're either going to price yourself out of the market or you're
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   not.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.160]   And if you price yourself out of the market, you out of business and therefore companies
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.840]   that are willing to pay for US wages don't exist because they go out of business because
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.000]   their prices are too high.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.360]   So we have to, like you're saying with other companies making in cheaper places, I guess
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   you're right.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.680]   If Nike can sell a pair of shoes for a hundred bucks, you're not going to buy that
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.760]   $300 one that are made locally.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   Right.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.160]   I mean, unless you're buying them from Kanye West who has the sneakers manufactured for
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.080]   five bucks and sells them for 900.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.880]   Actually, price is elastic.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.000]   We know it because people will pay a premium for the wrong reason, not because it's made
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.840]   in America, but because celebrities endorsed it.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   Yes.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:24.440]   And that's what I would love to see people embrace the concept of the boycott for real.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:32.840]   So if the consumer public stopped buying things based on this thing is the cheapest thing
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.760]   you can buy, then everything would change.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.040]   But that's not the case.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.120]   Like, look at airlines, for example, airline flying used to be awesome.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   And now it's horrible.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.120]   Why?
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.480]   Because people just go and buy the cheapest ticket.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.640]   They don't buy based on what has the best food or the best service or the nicest people
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   or whatever.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:57.400]   And so to cut back to meet the actual demand of actual consumers, they have to make everything
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.840]   cheap and horrible.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.400]   And that's exactly what happens in manufacturing.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.520]   People buy based on the lowest price and therefore things are manufactured in sweatshop
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.520]   conditions.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:15.120]   And in China, increasingly by literally slave labor, where they're using these these Uighurs,
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:20.120]   they round up by the millions based on the fact that they're Muslims and they put them
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.000]   into forced labor situations.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.600]   They're major American corporations that are actually having things manufactured by slaves,
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.520]   basically.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.480]   And nobody gives a crap.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:38.520]   And I think we should all as consumers do a reset and say, let's buy the stuff that
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:45.000]   is where the people working in the factory are making a living wage, where there's no
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.320]   exploitation and so on.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:55.080]   And that will create a market for humane manufacturing, whether it's in the US or otherwise.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.960]   You know, it's ironic because there is a bill in Congress aimed at preventing forced labor
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   in China.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   It's the Weager Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would require US companies to guarantee
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.280]   they do not use imprisoned or coerced workers from the weaker majority, the Muslim majority
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.800]   in the Xingong.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:22.640]   And apparently, according to the Washington Post, Apple is actually lobbying against this.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.720]   Of course they are.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.800]   Apple, of course, which makes a lot of hay about saying, no, no, no, we do everything
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:37.880]   we can to make sure that the workers are treated humanely and they're paid fairly.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.440]   But.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.360]   And they have only the best suicide nets.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.800]   Yeah, only the best.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:49.480]   So now, you know, this is an unsourced, it's the staffers, congressional staffers familiar
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:54.840]   with the matter, talking on the condition of immunity, of anonymity, said that Apple was
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.520]   one of many US companies that oppose the bill as it's written.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.680]   I just want to listen to more scams.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.680]   Mike, you're right.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.400]   The quicker way to just have peace on earth would just be to take money out of politicians,
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.240]   pockets and not be able to fund the lobbyists and do that stuff.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.600]   If we did that, we'd have a lot more fair system.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.320]   And the other scam I want to talk about Apple is they run run that stupid commercial and
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   tell me, oh, the box is thinner.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.280]   And we're going to help the environment by not putting a power brick in the box because
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:30.320]   there's already a million power bricks inside the ecosystem taking 55,000 cars off the road.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.640]   And yes, and inside this box with this phone is a cable that goes to a USB C. Mind you that
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.440]   every phone previous to this had a USB power brick to it.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.680]   Yeah, I got a buy a new one.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:47.200]   And they just lied to you to make it because we care about the environment.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.760]   We're going to see 400,000 trees by not giving you something.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.800]   We're still going to charge you 35 hours for America.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.360]   They really want to save the environment.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.800]   They make it repairable, but that's we all really do that.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.240]   Apple has a lobbying firm.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   Get ready for this.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:10.640]   Because Apple's Washington DC lobbying firm, it's called Fierce Government Relations.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.640]   Your fears.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.240]   Maybe that's the name of the lobbyists.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.240]   They work for.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   They did disclose they have to in a disclosure form that they are lobbying the bill on behalf
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.340]   of Apple.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340]   It's my guess.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:26.240]   They're not lobbying to make the protections for Uighurs stronger.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Add down.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   Wow.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.160]   You know, now I'm depressed.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.800]   But there's some good news.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.640]   Remember that Foxconn plant in Wisconsin?
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.280]   They got huge tax breaks for and the, you know, they broke the ground for and then.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.920]   It's got to be employing millions of people by now.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:49.720]   They're actually doing anything, but they did get a contract.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.160]   The yes.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   It's like what?
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   What?
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:59:01.560]   They're going to make a circuit boards for Google servers.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.960]   So there you go.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.160]   I don't know how many jobs that's going to create.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.680]   It's going to create four high paying jobs.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:14.720]   I assume it's like one of those show investment stock companies where they just have phones,
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.760]   lines attached to like kitchen fold up tables and like, this is a tough one though because
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.120]   I look, I think we would love to see jobs come back to America.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.280]   This is something that the president promised and campaigned on.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:36.880]   And for four years, I think has been trying to do, but we also live in a global economy
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:40.640]   and we don't send companies to do it.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.080]   We give them lots of reasons not to do it.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:48.920]   I would love to see, you know, these jobs come back to America.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.720]   Unfortunately, here's the jobs we're getting.
[00:59:51.720 --> 01:00:05.080]   Instead, Amazon has gone on a hiring spree in the last 10 months, 427,000 new employees,
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.840]   mostly working of course in warehouses.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:16.200]   Some of them outside of the US and India and Italy is out now has a 1.2 million people
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.800]   working globally.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.880]   But I have to think these are not the best jobs ever.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.360]   Again, you get sick, you're screwed.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.200]   The job that now, especially in America, we're a service economy.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.520]   So so many small businesses have lost and a lot of people have turned to an Amazon or
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.440]   to a Walmart to try and supplement their living.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.720]   And with Amazon, if you get COVID, you're just out.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.600]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are still going to work sick and working through it because,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.320]   you know, most cases people are fine.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.760]   There's no issues, but you can't afford to stay home.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.720]   So you still go in there and work that job, getting other people sick and that other person,
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.400]   the whole system is just a, you know, but wait a minute, you can't afford to go to the
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.840]   bathroom if you're in Amazon.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:07.960]   Jeff Bezos said they're offering industry leading pay and great healthcare industry leading.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   He's a liar.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   Okay.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.200]   He is the richest man in the world.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.680]   I mean, he also like the thing I drew to drives me the most crazy is like when somebody
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.440]   puts out the statistic in the pandemic, he's made enough money to pay every single factory
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.160]   employer $100,000 if he wanted to just give them a check.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.200]   And that doesn't happen because of everything that goes on with business.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.760]   But he could give these people a little bit of stimulus in his own company that would
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.200]   change their lives and their lifestyles instead of giving a $100 million imaginary to the environment.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.280]   You know, when he says, Oh, I'm giving $10 billion to help save the rainforest with no
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.560]   plan, with no outline, with no nothing.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.560]   He just put this out, you get pressed and people say, Oh, so you care as well.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560]   The environment.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.520]   How about you put that money back into the people and just help them?
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.720]   I mean, something that Zappos learned a long time ago, take care of your employees, take
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.360]   care of your customers and then happiness grows.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:04.160]   So I can't really blame Amazon though, because this is the this is how it works, right?
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   I know.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.360]   810,000 workers in the United States, but 85% of them are frontline employees in warehouses
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.080]   and operations.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:19.160]   They earn the minimum wage in all Amazon plants, regardless of what the state minimum is, of
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.960]   $15 an hour.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.600]   That's more than a retail job, but it's lower than typical warehousing jobs.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.960]   Amazon said this week, it'd pay bonuses of $300 for full-time employees and $150.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.240]   It sounds so small.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:40.280]   And I have to say, my daughter who works full-time for Trader Joe's and makes what she considers
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.680]   a living wage.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.640]   It's the minimum wage.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.000]   It's not a living wage.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.240]   It's very hard to live on the minimum wage, at least in Marin County of California.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.280]   The thing about Amazon is that it's both a monopoly and a monopsony and they have and
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:04.200]   there's a similar predatory scorched earth reality for employment.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.520]   So for example, the people who work at Amazon, you can say, well, just, you know, if it's
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.400]   so horrible, just go get another job.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.640]   Well, Amazon itself has sort of destroyed many of the types of companies that they would
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.240]   otherwise work at.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.160]   And again, it all boils down to the individual choices of consumers.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.760]   All of us, myself included, I'm 100% guilty in this regard, just go to Amazon.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   They got my address.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   They get overnight delivery.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   They have a credit card.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.120]   It's like, I can read it.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   And so we just all just reflexively go to Amazon and our own convenience and our own desire
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:47.040]   to pay the lowest price overwhelms our sort of collective humanitarianism.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.920]   We really should be buying through all kinds of other retailers.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.240]   And if we did that, not only would those companies do better, but those employees who
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.480]   work at Amazon would have other places to work.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.320]   Again, that's not going to happen.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.520]   People are more self-interested than they are interested in contributing to the greater
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520]   good.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.440]   With these jobs, Amazon had a career day in September, September 16th.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:20.320]   It said in the week leading up to career day, it got 384,000 job applications in the US
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.280]   and Canada, 38 a minute.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.880]   I think it might have something to do with how many people are out of work right now.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.960]   Amazon is one of the few people hiring.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.920]   And it's not just Amazon, I know I sound like I'm just bashing Amazon.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.080]   It's just corporate elite America that does the things they do.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.480]   They also do a lot of good things.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.360]   Like if you actually took the time to learn how to code, they're offering really great
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.840]   wages for those jobs if you want to take the time to either get educated or educate yourself
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.240]   and get one of those jobs.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.520]   That's one of the things that they're hiring for also.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.960]   They're looking for coders on all levels.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.720]   And that starts at like $54,000 to $100,000.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   So it's just one of those things where it's like, I know you could do better.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:09.360]   And I just see the things that they do on a micro scale of the way they can crush businesses
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.960]   because now they are so big.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.800]   Just a little inside science.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.280]   With their returns now, they basically consolidate everything off.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.360]   And they've branched out to multiple different stores to where instead of just returning
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.240]   through Amazon, you take it to a store and then they consolidate and ship it all back.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.360]   Well, they go to the store and they say, hey, we've got this new thing.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.200]   We're gonna bring people in your store.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.480]   We're gonna give you a dollar per item, right?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.240]   The store's like, okay, cool, I've never dealt with Amazon, whatever, the first three
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.200]   months, they're like, boom, we're making all this money.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200]   This is great.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.160]   We're also doing a lot of extra work.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.120]   After six months, Amazon's like, you know what, we're gonna go put them in four other stores.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.840]   If you don't lower your price by 67, 75%, we're just gonna cut you out.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.720]   Now you're like, you don't bought all these supplies.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.360]   You've got all this different chain.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.360]   You've trained all these people in this stuff.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:02.080]   I guess I have to accept the 30 cents on the dollar now because what am I gonna do?
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.880]   Say no and then not get anything.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:10.680]   So they're so strong that they affect other businesses like UPS shipping, like FedEx shipping,
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.960]   the post office.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   They are just unendating America.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.080]   I don't know about the world, but America, they've got their hands on everything right
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   now.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.360]   And it's a technical marvel.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.480]   It's impressive, but it's also really greedy.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.280]   That's what gets me all hyped up and angry about it.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.840]   Because we could be doing better.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.720]   I wish we could find a solution to this.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   I don't know what the.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.600]   >> Again, even on natural level, I'll tell you one thing about regular people because I'm
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.560]   talking about rich people.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.560]   Regular people found out that at Halloween, you don't have to go into a store to return
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.760]   your costumes.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.360]   So for the last two years, every year after Halloween, the next day and for the next week,
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.000]   at two of my stores low, we returned to 3000 costumes.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   >> What?
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.640]   >> Family if I'm in and return every single costume.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   Because you don't have to walk back into Walmart into the Halloween store and be embarrassed
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.680]   to say, well, it didn't fit.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.880]   You wore it out on Halloween, you wore it to a party, and then you walk out embarrassed.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.640]   But computer doesn't know.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.680]   So you buy it on the 15th and you make sure you got the extra 15 day window and everyone
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.920]   and their mom is returning Halloween costumes to which they're just going into a waist pile
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   or something.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.800]   >> You know they're not selling them again.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   >> No, so when people find a way to rip off the system, whether they're rich or on the
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.600]   bottom, human nature will give you that little edge if you want to take it.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.360]   >> I used to know a young lady who'd buy shoes at Nordstrom's, put tape on the bottom
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.000]   of them, wear them to a party, then return them the next day, take the tape off or turn
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.440]   them the next day, they didn't look worn at all.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   Never had to buy a pair of shoes.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.320]   >> It is, isn't it?
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.000]   >> I mean, on the other hand, she couldn't have, maybe they can't afford it.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.520]   This is the only way they could, I don't know what the answer is.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.320]   >> I say cut a sheet and put it on and just make your own house, have fun with your family.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   >> Again, that's just me.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.320]   >> I'm not a bus guy.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.320]   >> I'm not a bus guy.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.040]   >> Many of the year I've had a tin foil costume, it always works.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.200]   It's a good way to go.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.960]   >> And did you return the tin foil?
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.960]   >> I did.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   >> I did.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   >> That took it back to Costco.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   >> Yeah, it took it back.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   >> It didn't fit.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.840]   >> That Costco Christmas tree thing, you get 90 days if you return Christmas trees every
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   year.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   >> No.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.800]   >> Oh, you see all this because they come to you in your stores and you see all this.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.000]   >> I'm down here in the streets of the Liod.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.360]   So I said the tech bubble for me is a totally different place.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.240]   Like when I see I keep an eye on what kind of phones people are using, the watches, the
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.560]   devices, I got a good tally on what's going on in the street, Uncle Leo.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.160]   >> Yeah, the Christmas tree at Costco.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   That's a big deal.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   That's a thing.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   >> Wow.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   >> So Leo, here's hope.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:45.640]   >> I think because I actually think there's a good chance that we are going to partially
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.600]   get out of this whole situation.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.360]   And here's why.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:56.480]   The United States of America is we are a nation, we like to think of ourselves as rugged individualists,
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.880]   but we're actually conformists in a good way.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:05.040]   When there's a fad, everybody jumps on board and we actually make progress that way.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.360]   There was a time when your dog could crap anywhere and nobody cared.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.840]   And then there was a big fad where it's like, no, you have to have care of baggy and then
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   care.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.200]   >> Society, kind of decided.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.200]   That's not okay.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.080]   >> Same thing with littering, the same thing with junk food, same thing with smart things.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.080]   >> Smart as that gets started.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.080]   >> Smart tiny lunches.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.080]   >> How do you do that?
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:30.240]   >> Something and people get fed up with something that's conspicuously wrong.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.640]   And there's a big, there's a lot of scorn and ridicule involved and shaming and all that
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.440]   kind of stuff, but it makes the world a better place.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.160]   And I think that after, I don't want to get political at all, but after the Trump administration,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:49.080]   I think people are so fed up with liars and cheaters that I think we're going to, about
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:57.480]   to embark on a cultural revolution where we're fed up with liars and cheaters in general.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   >> Okay.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   So, Mike, I don't want to pop your bubble here.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.240]   I'm reading Jonathan Alter's wonderful new biography of Jimmy Carter.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.400]   And this was the last time this happened.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.320]   You may remember- >> The best ex president we ever had.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.360]   >> You may remember Richard M. Nixon impeached before he got kicked out, resigned.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.920]   Gerald Ford took over.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.880]   And in 1976, a couple of years later, Ford ran against Carter.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.280]   And Carter's whole thing was, in fact, he's slogan was, "I will never lie to you."
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.520]   He ran on integrity.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:36.520]   He ran on telling the truth, perhaps to his detriment, because four years later, a guy,
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.400]   a Hollywood actor, who instead of telling the truth, just said, "Everything's going
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.920]   to be okay.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.200]   It's a golden era in America.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.800]   It's mourning in America."
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.560]   He won and ran again and in other four years.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.080]   And it arguably was senile by then.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:59.040]   Didn't matter, because it wasn't that Americans wanted integrity in the office.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.120]   They didn't.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120]   They turned on Jimmy Carter.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.200]   They said, "We don't like you.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.360]   You're too honest.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360]   MalÃ¨se.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.600]   They wanted somebody who would lie to them pretty."
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   Yes.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.560]   >> And that was Ronald Reagan for eight years.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.720]   >> So that's a huge political historian nerd.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:22.840]   But let me contextualize this a little bit, because the criminality and lying of Nixon
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.840]   and Reagan was whiffleball.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.480]   >> Well, I'm hoping you're right.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   You're right.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.240]   There's never been anybody quite so willing.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:38.400]   Well, the difference between the two, you have to make this distinction.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.800]   Nixon's and Trump's corruption was self-dealing.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.320]   It was designed to help themselves in the case of Nixon and Trump politically and in
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.120]   the case of Trump financially.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:58.320]   In the case of Reagan, Lava Merhatum, Reagan's cheating and lying was in the service, was
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.560]   a misguided attempt to help the United States.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:07.600]   The Iran-Contra scandal was designed to cheat for national security.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.960]   It wasn't designed to cheat for personal gain or personal gain or personal gain or money
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.480]   or any of that stuff.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:23.840]   So I'm going to give Reagan a relative pass because he was not lining his own pockets.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.200]   I think the, in the last four years, it's not just the Trump administration or the people
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.400]   around Trump or the Senate or anything.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:42.160]   In general, there's been a sickening rampant lying and cheating in the culture in general.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.240]   And I think a lot of people feel the way I do, fed up with it, absolutely fed up with
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   it.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.120]   How do we get away from the liars and the cheaters?
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.280]   And I think that we have to come to understand the fact that ethics and morality is something
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.560]   that you work on.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.360]   It's like going to the gym.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.440]   You have to work on it.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.520]   You have to think about it.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.240]   You can't just, it reflexively reward the liars and cheaters.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.520]   Otherwise, they grow in the culture and they become out of control, which is exactly what
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   happened.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.880]   So I think we're in a totally different era than the Nixon era or the Reagan era.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.080]   But this is, we're in a whole nother place right now.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.480]   Especially with the recession and the coronavirus and all this stuff, we've all suffered.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.920]   I think it's really changed us as a culture.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:35.360]   And I think everybody ought to join those of us who are super interested in reembracing
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   ethics.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   I agree.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   I'd love to see that.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   Civic responsibility.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.560]   I may be too cynical to believe it, but I'd love to see it.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.360]   I'm going to get on the story, but I just want to hand this pipe to you, Mike.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.560]   I love you, but this is for your bloodstream.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.320]   That's not pipe.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.520]   That's a Festivus pole.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   I recognize that.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.440]   You know, some kind of tubular, you know what I mean?
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.440]   It's perfect question.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440]   What it is.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.440]   Just look at what we're doing.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.040]   So let's talk about something more realistic.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.920]   We got another text right here somewhere with something that actually could happen.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   They happen.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.400]   Are you actually uncomfortable by that?
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.280]   They're uncomfortable by this conversation.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.920]   I'm not uncomfortable by it at all.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.240]   I just don't want to go to another rant.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.720]   I don't want people yelling at me and telling me that I came on the show and turned into
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720]   a non-tech show.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.640]   So I just want to get back to the technical end.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.720]   The people lying.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.880]   We had Bill Clinton.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   He lied to his wife.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.400]   And we accepted why because he played jazz and he was cool.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.160]   Obama lied about a lot of stuff, but he hit a jump shot and he could dance.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.520]   He could move while he could sing.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:36.200]   So we just like there's a certain amount of lying that seems to be required if you want
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.880]   to be president of the United States.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.360]   There are lives that cheat on them and lie to their face and they take them back.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.280]   So expecting the whole construct of people.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.720]   I just told you humans are trash pandas.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   We are not great people.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   We are human beings.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720]   Tech store.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   Which one?
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:57.520]   But if we had an ad campaign like Smokey the Bear, only you can prevent forest fires.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.520]   Or the crying Indian for a little.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.160]   Or crying Indian.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.760]   I think honestly, if you want to really give credit for seat belts and litter and smoking
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.000]   and forest fires, you really have to give it to the ad agencies of the world who've become
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.700]   so adept at influencing human opinion.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:21.200]   Those are physical things picking up crap is physical, putting on a seat belts physical.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.520]   The emotional construct of people being anti lie, well everybody lies.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.000]   So I can't be anti how do you feel about shaving your nether regions?
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.120]   Look, he's got it.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120]   You think I'm not bad on the list.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.760]   You think that's nostril cleansers up.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.200]   I'm resting my body as soon as my head is over here manscaping the history.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.640]   So I don't get wet.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   Too much information.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.040]   Well actually, it's our sponsor, Manscaped.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.560]   Manscaped.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.160]   This is actually the if you're quarantined with a Sasquatch and clearly Owen is not a
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.440]   Sasquatch.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.600]   You might want to take a look at this.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.040]   The Manscaped Perfect Package 3.0.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.840]   It looks like Owen, you bought it all.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.400]   They've redesigned you have that's the electric trimmer there.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.800]   The lawnmower 3.0.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.760]   This thing is amazing with its proprietary skin safe technology.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.920]   It's waterproof so you can use it in a lake in a river and a stream or the shower if you
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   want.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.640]   I tell you, listen how quiet that is.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.680]   That's 7000 RPM.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.960]   That is a ceramic blade.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.360]   By the way, when you get the perfect package, you'll also get new ceramic blades every three
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   months.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.160]   The last thing you want when you're working down under is nicking or pulling.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.200]   You also get the crop preserver.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.720]   You get the crop reviver.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.760]   I won't tell you what they do.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:59.360]   Just let me say you want to apply these liberally at the right time and they smell manly and
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360]   great.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.480]   They also have, they call this.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.640]   Now this might be a little bit of hyperbole.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:07.040]   They call this the magic mat.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.680]   It's actually just a little, a little newspaper.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.800]   I thought it was just for humorous reading, you know.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.240]   But in fact, there's some good stuff in here, including some good manscaping designs you
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.240]   might want to apply.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   There's a little cross-rope puzzle.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.800]   Is there a pattern that you like apply?
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.440]   The shamrock, the royal, there's a little bird you could do.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   Get social.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   It's all good fun.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.240]   The idea is actually you spread this out when you're manscaping.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.740]   On the floor.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.740]   I didn't know.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.500]   Micah had explained it to me.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.200]   This nose hair trim is good.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.000]   This thing is actually legit.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.640]   Like I'm going to weed whacker.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.480]   I'm telling you, I bought this on my record.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   I bought this on my record.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.480]   No.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480]   This count.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.880]   But this thing is, if you're over 40, you know you got them stragglers coming out.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   Fix that.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   Stop.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   Stop.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   Stop.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880]   What did you fix it?
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   I have a friend.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   It was horrific.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.480]   I don't know, he was growing a shag carpet under his nose.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.320]   It was the most revolting thing.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.560]   I'm talking to him and I can't look him in the eyes because I'm staring at his nose
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   hairs.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.240]   Then, as you get older, you haven't experienced this yet.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.880]   The hair starts coming out of your ears.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.040]   Your eyebrows start getting a little wacky.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.480]   You're going to love having the weed whacker.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.720]   It's the best electric nose hair trim ever made.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   This is their manic.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.400]   Look, let me tell you.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.560]   If you're looking for holiday gifts for the Sasquatch in your life, if you've got a quarantine
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.080]   with them, you know you want them to clean it up.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.320]   Look, this is for their talons.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.920]   This is something, by the way, I wish my dad had told me.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.400]   Having manicured fingernails, women will judge you on your fingernails.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.080]   I'm just telling you guys, you will be judged.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.320]   So make sure you take good care of them and it's easy.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   It's simple.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:59.240]   It's fabulous and it all can be part of your future life with the Manned Scaped Perfect
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.680]   Package 3.0.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.120]   There's a crop cleanser, body wash.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.720]   It is awesome stuff.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.720]   They smell good.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   There's no commitment.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.920]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.040]   I think you're going to want to get the blade upgrades for sure for either the weed whacker
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   or the lawnmower.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.440]   I love how they name stuff.

[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.240]   There's no more baby powder.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.520]   There's crop preserver.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Crop preserver baby.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   What?
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.320]   Crop preserver places baby powder.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.560]   You will enjoy it.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   It's will.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.400]   It's an anti-chafing product.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.400]   Yes.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.400]   And it works.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.720]   Like I said, baby powder out.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.720]   Crop preserver baby powder.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720]   It's not good for you.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.440]   I'm coming man of 20/40 for a cyberpunk.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   You are in 20/7.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.400]   If you get to those crop preserver, I'm just letting you know.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   Yes, sir.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.360]   20% off free shipping.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.080]   Please do us a favor.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   Let them know you saw it here.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.080]   Go to manscaped.com/twit.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:22.520]   Did you have a story in mind, Owen J. J. Stone, O. Doctor?
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.960]   Or did you just want me to get change the subject?
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.920]   Well, I can I can rant about one more thing that the one story and I put in here.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.440]   We can just jump down to it real quick.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   Sure.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.200]   Just a Comcast to impose home.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.200]   God damn it.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200]   He's dang it.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.800]   And in my state too, like I've literally I've put out a Facebook thing.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.240]   I got a Facebook group started.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.640]   I'm like switch to Verizon immediately.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.120]   Like you can't get a device.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.480]   Does Verizon, if I also not have a cap?
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.280]   No, not only do they not have a cap, they give you the gigabyte up and down.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.920]   Like my speed is balling.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.680]   Like I have my up and down is outrageous.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.160]   Unfortunately, it's not available in my area.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   I do have Comcast.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.240]   Comcast gives you 250 down and like 50.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.360]   They are going to they've had this home internet data cap of of actually I think it was a
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.760]   terabyte, but they say 1.2 terabyte.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.200]   They launched it here in California.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.680]   They're now launching it nationwide.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:20.840]   If you go over your cap, $10 per 50 gigabytes up to $100, imagine your internet credit
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.320]   costing $100 more every month.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.880]   And here's the here's the and I used to get in such arguments with the Voreac over this.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.400]   He's not here to defend himself, but I'm just going to say it's my opinion.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:37.880]   There is no technical reason at all for data caps.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.120]   It doesn't it doesn't solve any problem.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.080]   They'll say, Oh, you know, your neighbor's using too much.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.160]   That is not true.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:52.320]   It is not it is not a way to protect their network at all.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.720]   It's a way to extract more money out of you.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.960]   It's extortion.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.760]   And it is particularly aimed at those of us who undermine Comcast's business model by
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:10.440]   streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime or iTunes or whatever instead of paying the cable bill.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.240]   It's pure greed.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240]   That's all I get.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.880]   Everybody should be aware of it so you can do something about it.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.160]   Again, it's like a drug dealer just giving you drugs and then telling you, Hey, the price
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.640]   just went up 7,000%.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.840]   I can't afford these drugs now.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.840]   What am I supposed to do?
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840]   I don't have.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.040]   Oh, I'm stuck because I don't have another option.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.560]   It's just bad when companies do this and there is no reason to do it other than greed.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.080]   And they have a monopoly or a best to do wobbly in many areas.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.280]   You don't have a choice in my town.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.440]   Half the town can get Verizon.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.200]   The other half has no option.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.600]   Like in just in one town, one side of the street got Verizon and they shut it all down.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.120]   I guess because of the pandemic.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.360]   So now only one side of town has two options.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.400]   The other side of town has only one.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.600]   So and by the way, Starlink will help that situation.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.040]   Well, there'll at least be some competition.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.040]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   I don't know.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   Do you think?
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.040]   I hope so.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.040]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.520]   I mean, sarcastic or you're genuine.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.800]   No, no, no, I genuinely am very bullish on Starlink for several reasons.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.880]   And one of them is to provide an alternative in various markets.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.240]   So we'll see what the reality of that whole service is in terms of the pay in terms of
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.760]   the bandwidth and all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:30.800]   But if they go forward as advertised, you'll have another option in literally every single
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.080]   market.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.480]   Competition is key.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.720]   And the FCC has essentially created these Duapley's.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.640]   The cable company is a monopoly in your town.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.080]   It's a regional monopoly.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.040]   The phone company, the ILAC is a regional monopoly.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:50.600]   And those are the two internet service providers for almost 90% of Americans.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.880]   Incidentally, you might say, well, how do you know, Leo, that they don't have to do
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]   these data caps?
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.880]   They say they have to because, you know, bandwidth is limited.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.920]   And you do recognize to get this argument.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.920]   I said, it bits is water.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.280]   It doesn't cost them more to give you more water.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.800]   They'll make more bits.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:15.000]   And the proof is in the pudding for 60 days during the coronavirus pandemic back this past
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.080]   summer, they lifted caps.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   They were nice.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.360]   They said, you're going to be zoom in.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   You're going to be doing that.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.960]   That only lasted two months.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.440]   Did the internet collapse?
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.160]   Did everybody die?
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.600]   Did it were we unable to get online?
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.800]   No, in fact, since they've turned those caps back on, I noticed Amazon's down a lot more.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.920]   Microsoft's down a lot more.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.920]   There was no side effect to eliminating caps for two months.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.080]   The cell phone industry, remember when you only had a certain amount of space and then
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.280]   AT&T went unlimited and everybody moved on AT&T?
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.000]   They didn't die and fold.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.480]   Other networks like, I guess we got to do it too.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.880]   T-Mobile came to do a Verizon, finally came around and said, okay, everybody's unlimited.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.760]   Okay, we're just going to charge you whatever dollar amount it is.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.720]   But now it still works.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.880]   The internet hasn't fallen apart because now every cell phone service offers unlimited.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.560]   And now with their fake 5G in most places, the internet is still fine.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   It's just great.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   It was bad for a while.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.640]   It happened at AT&T when the iPhone first came out because they didn't anticipate how
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.280]   much data people would use.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.960]   But so they beefed up their infrastructure.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.320]   Guys, it's not like they're not making a lot of money.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.680]   It's not like it's not a profitable industry already.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.560]   They could put more and I think what happened is these companies look at the bandwidth usage,
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.240]   the relative usage, and they see that a huge percentage of their customers are barely using
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.360]   any data at all.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   And then there are people like Owen who are just using terabytes of data, just flying
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.600]   around and thinking, there's got to be a way.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.240]   They're just using our service so much more than these other people.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.600]   There's got to be a way to extract all kinds of money out of these people.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:59.200]   And they just can't stand the fact that there's such a divergence of consumption for their
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.320]   product and logically they think, well, we've got to just make some mint out of these people.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:12.480]   We've got to improve our sort of how we look to our shareholders and show growth.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.960]   Let's just screw these guys.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.480]   They're using it, overusing it.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.880]   But the reality is that just when you offer a public service like that, that's what you're
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.880]   going to get.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   You're going to get super users.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.320]   You're going to get people barely use anything.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.400]   They can handle it.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:30.120]   I've talked to Jane Dain Jasper, a good friend, CEO of SonicNet.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.560]   They're rolling out fiber as widely as they can in our area and much of California.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.960]   I asked him about this.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   They don't have data caps.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   So we don't need data caps.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.280]   There's plenty of bandwidth out there.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.400]   Mike, Mike, why are you driving the throw me?
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.920]   Mike, don't be telling me about the terabytes.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   I got to hide the target.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.680]   I'm going to throw in one stone.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   Don't know.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.840]   I have not used it terabytes.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:58.280]   How many of those special fire TV sticks do you have in there?
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.920]   Nobody believes you.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.120]   I'm PS5 is beaming directly into the Pentagon right now.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.240]   Mike, don't snitch on me, baby.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.000]   I'm over here with the pedophiles.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.560]   Don't let nobody know.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.080]   The truth really is Comcast is terrified.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:17.000]   All of these companies are terrified because their big profit items are cable TV services
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.880]   and we're getting more and more over the top.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.640]   They know that base, at first they weren't denial for a long time saying, no, no, no,
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.160]   we're not worried about court cutters.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.360]   Now they know the time is rapidly approaching when people will stop getting their TV services
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.200]   and just do it over the internet.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.760]   Their whole plan right now is, well, we're going to make the internet as expensive as
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.440]   cable TV was so that we can maintain our profits.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.880]   And the pendulum is swinging.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.240]   If they actually went and cut their prices, YouTube TV just went up $25.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.400]   I mean, I'm like, come on, bro, I barely watched TV.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.160]   I bought you just for football and I got to cancel them and pause them every once in a
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160]   while.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.680]   Then you got HBO giving out HBO Met.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.520]   Now there's too much streaming.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.640]   And if the cable company said, hey, look, we're going to bundle this and give you this,
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.720]   then I probably go back to cable because the cable just got so outrageous that if they now
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.960]   when you add up 32 subscriptions, you know what I mean?
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   I mean, I'm cheating.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960]   I'm not paying everything.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.520]   I mean, I got one person with Defle has got another person with Disney and I'm not, I
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.680]   got, you know, we're here.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.200]   We're in a coalition, but I'm saying there's too many subscriptions going right now.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.880]   So the cable companies cut down, they'd make all that money back.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.120]   They could switch the pendulum around for themselves, but they'd rather just try to
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.360]   work for internet.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:34.760]   The number of paid TV households buying cable peaked in 2010, 10 years ago at 105 million.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.000]   It's been dropping ever since by next couple of years.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.400]   It'll probably down to 72 million.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.880]   It's widely expected.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.960]   It'll be even it'll end up half of that.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.600]   There's still be people using cable TV for a while, but it's slowly going away.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.840]   And actually, I think the trend is actually accelerating because I look at anybody under
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:02.120]   25 and their look their entire content comes from YouTube.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.520]   They don't watch cable TV.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:16.360]   So Nick at night viewership down 24%, AMC down 22%, FX down 21%, USA networks 19%, TBS down
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.160]   16%, TNT down 14%.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.600]   It's across the board.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.600]   It's just it.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.680]   And so these companies are, you know, they're scrambling now.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.880]   Starlink's interesting because I think Starlink might be expensive.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.400]   They're launching satellites like crazy.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.360]   Just launched another 60 last week.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:41.320]   They're currently charging $99 a month, but up front, you have to pay 500 bucks for the
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.160]   satellite dish.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   Yeah, that for the beta test.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.560]   And we don't know what the pricing will be for post beta test.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.320]   So it could be more could be less.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:59.280]   We don't know the, but we do know that the, that satellite dish is super expensive.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.880]   They're taking a bath.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.640]   They're selling a balloon with that pricing.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   Yes.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.440]   And so there's, there's some uncertainty there that, that we don't know about.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:17.480]   But I think that in the end, I think it will be a kind of expensive service.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:24.880]   But with the trend of people moving out of cities and moving to rural areas, to me, you
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.480]   know, one of the, one of the biggest reasons why, you know, you don't want to build a house
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.640]   in the middle of nowhere is internet connectivity.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.360]   It's just awful out, out in the sticks.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.680]   And now with the improvements in solar power, and now with the, you know, internet based
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.720]   satellite like Starlink, you're going to be able to buy a piece of property in the middle
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.720]   of nowhere.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.720]   Well, wait a minute, no infrastructure.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.040]   You just did that.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.600]   Yes, I did.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:53.160]   Do you have internet in that new place?
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:31:00.400]   So I have a, so what Leo's talking about is that Amir and I just bought 17 acres of forest
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:06.960]   land in southern Washington, which itself actually gets mobile broadband.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.760]   So you can, you can at least get, you know, your phone, there's no cable going out your
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.600]   way or anything like that.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:20.680]   There might be, however, my brother has a piece of property just six miles west and
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.000]   they have nothing out there.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.800]   They have no, and he's just can't wait to get Starlink.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.040]   They don't have their phones, their cell phones don't work.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.680]   They don't, they don't get cable.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.440]   They don't get anything.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.440]   And yet they are building a house there and they're living on this property and they,
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   they do have electricity.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.200]   They're going to build a septic system.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.680]   They can have everything except for the internet connectivity, which of course is their whole
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   livelihood.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.680]   It's kind of the dream.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.440]   I mean, living off the grid, you know, totally.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:56.560]   And there's a, there's a, there's a sort of self-reinforcing phenomenon that's happening
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.560]   as we speak.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560]   So people are moving out of cities.
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.400]   Ritcher people are moving out of cities.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.880]   People with jobs that they can do online are moving out of cities.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.960]   You've got to have internet to do that.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.000]   You've got to have good internet.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.600]   But what's, what's happening with all this flight from cities is the cities are going
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.800]   to become less desirable places to live.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:22.440]   These are the people that support, you know, the yuppy, you know, the, the hipster coffee
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.040]   shops and like all the cool things that makes living in a city so great.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:31.960]   And so city living is going to get worse, which is going to inspire more people to leave
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.920]   the cities, which is going to make the cities even worse, et cetera.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.260]   So we're going to, we're going to see, I think our major cities turn into what they
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:43.240]   were in the 70s, which is, you know, horrible places to live.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.480]   And I think a lot more people are going to be living in the sticks.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:50.360]   And I think that's, I think that Starlink is an underappreciated factor in the flight
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:55.200]   from cities and the embrace of the wilderness, you know, living in the middle of nowhere.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.640]   And you're kind of bent on it.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.400]   You lie and can pull it off.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.640]   I'm totally part of it.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:06.360]   And you're basically you and your brother are betting that Elon's going to pull it off.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.520]   Well he is more than I am because he's, he's going to live, live there.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.880]   We're going to do a cabin where we live there sometimes when we're not traveling.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.600]   But he is absolutely betting on that.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.960]   I mean, you know, they, they, they were looking at other, you know, a million other options.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.480]   There are no good, I mean, there's connectivity within like half a mile away.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.000]   And there are ways to beam that with a partnership of somebody as a complicated problematic situation.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.480]   But they're really looking forward to internet satellite, internet.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.240]   In our case, you know, we'll, we'll figure out the best option for internet.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.600]   We will get internet, but we're not really, really depending on it.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:49.120]   Once you, once this thing is a known commodity, once, once people really understand how Starlink
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.720]   works, I think we're, you're going to see the real estate market in the middle of nowhere
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.480]   just completely take off because there is, there are, you know, we were, we spent six
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.800]   months looking for a really great piece of property.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.720]   And they, you know, there were, you know, three quarters of the places we looked at
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.200]   were like, oh, wow, they are so far in the middle of nowhere that that, that is, that
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.320]   is just not going to happen.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.760]   But once, you know, Starlink comes online, all of those properties become desirable to,
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.800]   to, to, to lots of people.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.160]   They're cheap, they're beautiful, they're in nature.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.480]   They have everything going for them except internet connectivity.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.120]   And Starlink is going to change that.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.040]   You know, by the way, now the second richest man in the world.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.040]   Yep.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:40.840]   After Jeff Bezos beating Bill Gates took Bill Gates a long time to become the richest
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:41.920]   man in the world.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:48.280]   It feels like, you know, I feel like Elon, he made money in PayPal.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.400]   He basically took that money, put it all on red.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.120]   He put all his chips on Tesla and it paid off.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.960]   It entered the S&P 500 and suddenly he's the second richest man in the world.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.560]   Obviously, I own a test.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560]   I own the Tesla.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.680]   I think what he did is a great.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.400]   He, he jumped, started electric vehicles in the world.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.120]   I think SpaceX is great.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:14.160]   He's kind of strange.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   Yep.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:22.040]   But he's, he's really good at making big, big, big bets that actually pay off.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.720]   I mean, you've got the boring company, which I think could turn into something.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:31.080]   You have SpaceX, which suddenly is just the, it's, it's the cool.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.480]   It's the most amazing thing happening in space right now.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.800]   They're, they're sending astronauts.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:42.520]   He is the America space program in terms of sending astronauts into space.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.240]   We were relying on Russia for, we were using Soyuz vehicles.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   Yep.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.240]   Yes.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:56.360]   From, from the Soyuz era to put astronauts on the space station.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:02.880]   This time three Americans and a Japanese astronaut, the Japanese astronaut said it was the best
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   space.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   He's been on Soyuz.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.920]   He's been on the old American flights, NASA flights.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.520]   And now he's one of the few people who's been all three.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.760]   He said he's a kind of sir, apparently, space flight.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.600]   He said this is the best run I've ever had.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.600]   Best run.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.320]   Oh, by far, it's, it's like a big room with like lazy boys.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.120]   The Soyuz capsule is like you're in a Pringles can like stuffed in there with like a, one of
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.160]   those inflatable rafts when somebody pulled the thing and everybody, I mean, it's just,
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.960]   it's just a great experience.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.840]   You think it's, I mean, is that going to make the world a better place though?
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:40.440]   It's going to make, it's going to make, it's going to make Elon Musk's bank account a
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.440]   better place.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.000]   He's also got this company NeuralLink.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.640]   He's trying to create, you plug it in the jack into the metaverse kind of.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:52.640]   That's that.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640]   The NeuralLink thing I'm out on.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.760]   The boring company is trash, but Starlink and sending people in the space and Tesla,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:00.760]   those are all the jams.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:04.800]   So it's like he's got three for, he's like 50% and 50% of what he's doing.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.800]   What's the main about her money?
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:06.800]   Batteries.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   That may be the single, I mean, that's the, that is the kind of infrastructure investment
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.320]   that may actually be the real value of the whole thing.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]   Yep.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   I appreciate what he's done for my stock portfolio.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.920]   Oh, you got some, you got some of that Tesla stock?
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.480]   I had that Tesla stock when Tesla stock was 65 hours a share.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.760]   I'm a early Tesla.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.160]   I made the mistake also, not mistake of selling off half of it right that boom time.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.840]   I bought myself some Bitcoin, so I double dipped and I'm just riding this Elon train.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.840]   You know what I mean?
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.840]   Right?
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   That train.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.840]   I mean, he's not boring.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:42.840]   I'm champagne.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.840]   No olds.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:44.840]   I don't believe in that.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]   I don't believe in that.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.600]   And he ain't jacking nothing in the back of my head, but the Starlink, the battery, the
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.800]   Tesla, solar, all that, all that.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.800]   You bought a 10.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:52.800]   You bought a 10.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   50.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   It is now $585.76.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.240]   I sold it off when it was like, what was it?
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   A thousand?
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240]   It was something more.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.240]   Oh, man.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.160]   I made a good amount.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160]   Can I invest with you, Oh, doctor?
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.880]   Hey, look, I'm just saying I'm from the future and I got to introduce you to some herbal medicine
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:15.120]   stocks that you can get on really cheap right now.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.320]   A whole percent in the last two months.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.320]   You're kidding.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.320]   I'm not.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.320]   Wow.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.760]   So why do you buy in raffle tickets for PS5s?
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.800]   Because I'm a lucky guy.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.240]   I don't spend a little money.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.240]   Play big.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.560]   It's one of those things like Leo.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.480]   It's like I'm living in a bunker.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.800]   You don't know what I do for a living, but I do a lot of things for a living to live,
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   but I just want to live regular.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.680]   I'm about to go live out there to two acres with Mike.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.280]   Mike got two acres in the sideline for me.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.760]   As soon as he got started, Link, I'm going to put my little, little mini house on there
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.200]   and become hanging out with, with Uncle Mike.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200]   You are welcome.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.400]   You are absolutely welcome.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.840]   I want to, I would live off the grid, but what I would also live off as the internet.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.360]   I don't want to be on the internet.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.840]   As soon as I'm done podcasting, I don't know when that's going to be.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.840]   Never.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840]   Never probably.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.400]   As soon as I don't need the podcast, I guess, you know what I could do?
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.920]   I could, I could do the show in the house and get somebody to drive it into town.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.920]   On a hard drive.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.080]   Just drive it into town and say, Hey, I got a new podcast here.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.480]   Could you drive this into town and John, you could be in town and we'll just give it to
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.920]   you and you could upload it.
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.920]   How about that?
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.240]   See, I don't need internet.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.840]   If we had a neural link, I could just download your brain and we wouldn't need you anymore.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.840]   That's the reason you have to keep podcasting.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.840]   That's the future.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.840]   That is totally.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.960]   So in all these weird random, I had a DigiMazoo from 87.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.320]   What do I do with that guy?
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.760]   What are we going to do without you, Gileo?
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.240]   So that's what we're working on.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.240]   Neural link.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.240]   No, no, no.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   That's cool.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:44.760]   We have more than a hundred thousand hours of Leo in the can.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.760]   Yes.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]   It's more than enough.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:49.160]   This is what this is what your retirement looks like.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:55.960]   So all every show you've ever done will be entered into this AI and they'll and we're
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.360]   going to use generative adversarial networks, otherwise known as deep fakes to simulate
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.360]   your voice.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.360]   Deep fake Leo.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.600]   And it's just these these podcasts are just going to be automatically generated.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   They'll never end.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.920]   And it may have.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.080]   I just want to say you won't be able to tell and it may have already happened.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:18.440]   And technically we could just be using the system that YouTube uses to check out videos
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.640]   and algorithms for context.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.640]   We don't need you anymore.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:22.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:24.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   Thank you.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   I am out of here.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:35.520]   Hey, before we go any farther, let's give Kevin his advertisement.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.760]   Mike's son is doing some amazing stuff.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.840]   Tell us about that, Mike.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.840]   Thank you.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.840]   Yes.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.840]   Thank you so much.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.120]   So Kevin makes this.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.240]   This is a chatter box.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.720]   What this is is essentially an Amazon Echo type device that anybody over the age of eight
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.880]   or nine can make themselves.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.920]   So there's a cardboard outer box and you can customize and get another one.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.640]   They're very inexpensive for the outside parts.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:04.400]   And then you put the electronics in there.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.960]   There's a proprietary hat in there for the for the audio.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.240]   There's a very importantly, there's a button on the top.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:16.280]   So it doesn't it doesn't listen unless you push the button so it's not listening.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:20.880]   It's very private and chatter bot and either chatter box or any of the services that chatter
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.520]   box relies on knows who is using the service.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.160]   It's perfectly private.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:31.800]   Do not feed your kids into the Amazon privacy violating machine.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.600]   It's also illegal for schools to do that because they're their laws protecting kids from privacy
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600]   violations.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.680]   So once they've built this, they can use a very easy to use tool builder to build skills.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.520]   chatterbox doesn't do anything until you teach it how to do each and everything.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.560]   And so for kids under lockdown who are using this right now, they absolutely love it and
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:42:00.360]   their parents love it because it's endless learning and playing by developing skills.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.840]   And with each skill, chatterbox gets smarter.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.160]   And so you push the button button, you just turn on the lights.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:14.640]   It does more than an Amazon Echo does, theoretically, it leverages all kinds of services through
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.560]   APIs, teaches kids what APIs are.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.280]   It uses Wolfram Alpha.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:25.480]   It uses all these different brilliant services for the weather, for this, for that.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.720]   You can communicate.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   You can make calls.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   You can send texts.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.240]   You can do all kinds of things.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:37.240]   And it's just a brilliant, brilliant product for kids who are looking for STEM education,
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.600]   who are learning, they learning language skills because you have to craft exactly what you
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.080]   say and what it says back.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.320]   So you're thinking about language and how to communicate clearly.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.360]   Which is the most fantastic educational product in history.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.560]   And here's the part that I mentioned earlier.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.640]   Starting CyberMoney Monday, which for chatterbox lasts the entire week, you can get 25% off.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640]   Nice.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.920]   Well, so that's going to be at hello chatterbox.com starting probably today or tomorrow he's
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.920]   going to put up that information.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.960]   But I highly recommend this, whether you're a child or not, whether you have a child or
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960]   not.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.200]   That's a fun, fun, fun project.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.960]   It's pure fun.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.320]   And you end up, at the end of the day, you end up with something like an Amazon Echo without
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.680]   the Amazon part and all the privacy violation that goes with that.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.280]   So I highly recommend it.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.320]   And it's just a wonderful thing.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:36.640]   And it's just, you know, he initially was going to spend 2020 selling this to school
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.400]   districts.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.680]   They're not showing up for work for the most of the year.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.600]   So he's been selling it to parents whose kids are in lockdown and need projects that will
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.600]   keep their mental stimulation going.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.800]   So it's just a fantastic product.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.720]   I kind of wish I was younger because I would love to use this to teach them.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.720]   This is really cool.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.440]   It can text and call, which is also cool.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440]   That is really neat.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.880]   And it runs on a Raspberry Pi, which is really interesting.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:14.720]   It's very efficient and, you know, the secret sauce is in the interface and the software
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.760]   and also the audio hat that just makes building something.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.160]   You know, everyone will say prepare kids the future, teach them how to code.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.840]   That is false.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.480]   That is wrong.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.640]   Kids are not going to be typing code in the future.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:35.560]   They're going to be interacting with artificial intelligence voice agents as the main interface
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.560]   for computers.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.800]   And so you've got to, if you want to prepare kids for the future, prepare them to fully
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.440]   understand what voice-based AI is and how it works.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:47.920]   And that's what Chatterbox does.
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.480]   Nice.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.320]   And they're shipping quickly so you can get in time for Christmas if you order now.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320]   So absolutely.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.320]   Yep.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:00.520]   And in fact, he launched last Christmas and he dragooned me into the manufacturing product
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.520]   product.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.520]   Really?
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.520]   Oh, it's cute.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:07.160]   Sure, we were just putting together kids and sending them out.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.480]   And he hit every single one and every kid got there's time for Christmas.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.360]   That was his Kickstarter last year.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.560]   And he's just been massive improvement since then.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.560]   So that's so cool.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.560]   Check it out.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.560]   That's so cool.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.560]   Congratulations, Kevin.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.960]   It's really, really a great project.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.240]   Hello Chatterbox.com.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.720]   Hello Chatterbox.com.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.640]   Now for a pay dad.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:34.640]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.640]   I'll send you two.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.280]   I'm really thrilled to have both of you guys here.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:46.600]   Oh, Dr. Owen J. J. Stone, IQMZ.com.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   Raising a Ninja.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.640]   Are you still doing the Raising the Ninja podcast?
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.640]   Yes.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.340]   I have three episodes to upload it, but I'll do it.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.340]   Get going.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.340]   Get going.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.340]   Get going.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.340]   Give him to John.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.340]   He's sneaking drive them over.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.340]   Drive them over.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.780]   And Mike Elgin at Elgin.com.
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:09.380]   And of course, we're soon, once this COVID is over and I think the vaccine is really on
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.860]   the way, which is very exciting.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.980]   You're going to get back to being a gastro nomad.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:16.620]   I am very excited gastro nomad.net.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:18.620]   Can't wait.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:19.620]   Can't wait.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:21.820]   We're ready to travel.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:24.700]   Our show today brought to you by Forward Networks.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:30.340]   I spent some time with these guys and I am so impressed with what they did.
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:38.580]   They started, they were four PhD students at Stanford about seven years ago and they
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:50.620]   created a way to model networks in software, to model networks in software.
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:56.380]   Open networks basically delivers you a digital twin of your network, completely accurate
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:00.540]   mathematical model in software.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.540]   It can go out.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.060]   It can survey the network for you automatically.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:11.020]   It can build this and then imagine what you could do with this software model.
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:14.060]   You can verify your network is configured correctly.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:18.580]   You can verify that it's in compliance with policies that it's behaving as you expect
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:19.580]   it to.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:25.660]   If you're considering a change in your network, boy, I wish more network operators would use
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:31.740]   this because how many times have people changed their BGP settings and brought the internet
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:33.260]   down?
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:39.820]   You could run the change against the software model so you know what's going to happen.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:44.100]   This ensures your network is healthy and agile and you don't get those embarrassing
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:47.540]   misconfigurations that can ruin your day.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.100]   Here's some of what Forward Networks does.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.500]   You have a dashboard that gives you key network insights, visualizations.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:56.940]   We're looking at them right now on the screen that are easily consumable, exportable.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:02.420]   You can automatically create an always accurate network diagram with full details about the
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.260]   topology of your environment.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:09.020]   It searches network behavior, configuration and state network wide with an intuitive and
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.020]   powerful tool.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.100]   It's basically spidering.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:16.260]   You could perform end-to-end path analyses across your network both on-prem and in the
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.620]   cloud.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:21.780]   You could proactively identify potential connectivity violations.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:25.780]   You can make sure your network is configured and behaving exactly as intended.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:30.100]   Again, this is on-prem and in the cloud and with virtual overlay networks.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:33.180]   You can set, check and customize policies.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:36.980]   There is this thing called behavior diffs.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:41.140]   If you've ever done a text file diff, you know what we're talking about.
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:45.060]   You create behavior diffs that will give you side-by-side comparisons.
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.300]   One quick view of configuration file changes for any device between points and time.
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.660]   You can immediately see what's going to happen.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:57.140]   Fifty percent faster resolution network trouble tickets, ninety percent faster fixes related
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:02.220]   to audit processes, thirty-three percent reduction in the Board of Network updates due to identified
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.220]   errors.
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:10.060]   Imagine being able to, just like a Google search, search your network for what's causing problems.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:13.340]   Some of the biggest companies in the world use forward networks.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:16.980]   In fact, PayPal, they were having issues with their network.
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.620]   They thought they would build it themselves.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:23.700]   Instead, they found forward networks and they said, "Oh, look, all we needed was this software
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.900]   model that can find trouble spots, saves us time and money."
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:34.580]   They've worked with Telstra, Verizon, Bank of America, several large government agencies
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.100]   we can't name.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:41.260]   Get network automation and verification for your intent-based network with forward networks.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.260]   You're going to be so glad you heard this show and found out about this.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.260]   Go to forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.740]   Forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:52.620]   They've got a podcast seeking truth in networking.
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.020]   Isn't that a great name?
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:58.500]   You can download it anywhere you get podcasts, search for it, seeking truth in networking
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:01.780]   or go to forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:05.420]   I went, when I explained this to me, I was so excited.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.420]   This is brilliant.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:13.420]   The business depends on it and you've got to see the demo.
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.420]   Forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:15.420]   Try it.
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:16.420]   You'll be amazed.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:17.420]   Who knew?
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:23.060]   Black Friday was yesterday or Friday and Cyber Monday is Monday.
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:26.580]   Adobe, this is one of their little sidelines.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:34.580]   Every year they follow online sales in real time at 80 of the top 100 retailers covering
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.860]   some 100 million SKUs.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:45.580]   They said on Black Friday, US consumers spent the number is in $9 billion.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:50.780]   That's up 21% over last year.
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:52.140]   I guess that's not a surprise.
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.180]   We've been buying everything online more and more every year.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:00.660]   Forecast was somewhere between 8.9 and 9.6 billion, so maybe it wasn't as high as they
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.660]   thought it was.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:08.460]   In fact, the second largest online spending day in US history, but wait.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.980]   Cyber Monday says, "Hold my beer.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.780]   We'll see what it's like tomorrow."
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:13.820]   It's all Cyber Monday now.
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.980]   I think Black Friday is dead for good even when the pandemic is over.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.980]   I think the days when people line up at 4 o'clock in the morning and then just go clawing each
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:24.980]   other and traveling each other to get-
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   Thank God.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:26.980]   People died.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:27.980]   Yes.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:31.620]   People got injured trying to get those crappy door buster specials.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.620]   That's right.
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:36.700]   It's a terrible way to do it because online you can comparison shop.
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.060]   I think it's all Cyber Monday now.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:45.700]   I wonder though, somebody in the chatroom said, and it's a really good question, why the long
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:50.520]   food lines and 21% increase in online sales?
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:58.660]   I fully don't understand how that quantifies as real because massive job loss are, I guess,
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.420]   who's spending this money?
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.420]   Yes.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.420]   Who?
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:07.820]   Because I was a Philly two weeks ago and I was like, there was a line, this is not even
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.860]   a joke, there was a line eight blocks long.
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:13.700]   When I got to my friend's house, I'm like, what are they selling at the store over there?
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:14.860]   He's like, what are you talking about?
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.300]   We drove back around and it was a food line.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.300]   It's a food line.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.620]   Like it was eight blocks long and people were there with a cart.
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.340]   Baskets of food for Thanksgiving.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:24.660]   I'm like, it didn't even dawn to me that that's what it was.
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.420]   I just thought people were lining up to buy something.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.380]   There are two things happening, I think.
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.140]   Yeah, there are two things that are happening.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:38.580]   First is that one of the interesting cultural moments we're in right now is a kind of lockdown
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:39.580]   fatigue.
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:45.060]   So, after months and months and months of people spending a lot less than they normally would
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:49.220]   because of the uncertainty, because of the possibility of recession and job loss and all
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.220]   that kind of stuff.
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:55.620]   I think people are at this point, sort of in this frame of mind of like, you know what?
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:57.740]   Screw it, I'm going to spend some money.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:02.460]   And the other part of it is there are new fears about a coming surge in the coronavirus,
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:03.700]   more uncertainty.
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:06.700]   You can't find toilet paper anymore, Costco.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.900]   And people are also hoarding.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:17.980]   So it's the pandemic fatigue, it's the Thanksgiving holiday, and it's a new surge in hoarding that
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:21.100]   is driving a lot of stuff, plus the holidays are coming.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.940]   So I think it makes a lot of sense that people are spending a lot more.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:30.020]   But I do think also makes sense is that when we look at the entire year, there's not going
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.260]   to be a huge uptick.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:37.500]   I just think that the spending has been redistributed from the middle of the year to this part of
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:43.340]   the year where people just buying things they otherwise would have bought months ago.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:47.420]   I feel like there are two Americas now.
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.980]   There's the America, and I'm sad to say I'm in this, I'm not sad to say, but it's kind
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.860]   of, I feel guilty to say it.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.860]   This part of America that's still making money, we're making a lot less, I think, to it made
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:03.660]   millions of dollars less this year, but we still make enough money to live well.
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:08.820]   And we didn't spend on eating out and travel, so we do have discretionary income.
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.460]   That's one half.
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:14.180]   But then there's the America, one in four Americans are suffering food insecurity right
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.180]   now.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:22.780]   Out of work, out of unemployment benefits at the end of December, no stimulus check,
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:27.420]   no hope, landlords saying you got to pay the rent.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:33.060]   I feel like this is, it's the divide between the half and half knots has never been more
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:33.900]   stark.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:37.220]   And it's terrifying to me.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:41.420]   I also didn't think about, like, so me and my daughter, we go to the movies, we see every
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.740]   movie, you know, terrible, horrible movies.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:48.460]   And I was thinking to myself, you know, I'm just going to buy a huge TV and then we'll
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.460]   just sit home because we're watching everything at home.
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:53.260]   I have like 55 inch, whatever, it's not because it's not a big deal.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:56.940]   I'm like, I'm gonna go out and buy me a 85 inch TV just so we can sit home and watch
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:57.940]   our movies.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.540]   I don't need this TV, but I was going to buy it.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.700]   And I think about it.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.980]   That's the thing, like your money shifts, right?
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:05.300]   So the people are still working and do have money.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.660]   You're not able to go out and eat.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:11.020]   You're not able to go out to a football game or a baseball game or like I have season
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:12.860]   tickets and such, like there's certain things you can't do.
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.020]   So you do have income shifts.
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.500]   So I guess people could spend more money because they got cabin fever.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:21.740]   I didn't think about it that way, but that is something that probably happened a lot.
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:24.060]   Obviously because the numbers are so high.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:32.500]   I'm sure that's where the 26% came, but I worry about another 20%, 29% of households with
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.500]   children that don't know where the next meal is coming from.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.380]   Yeah, and it's going to get worse.
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:39.940]   There are going to be evictions.
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:47.100]   There was an initial surge in relief and forgiveness and so on for rent payments and
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:48.900]   mortgage payments and all that kind of stuff.
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:51.140]   But that's going to come to an end at some point.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:58.940]   Hopefully they'll be politically driven solutions to that coming problem.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.140]   But right now we're not aware of what those are.
[01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:04.140]   So it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:09.340]   But I also think that Leo, you shouldn't apologize for your success.
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:14.580]   You are doing your part because you pay your people a good wage.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.900]   You are a great guy to work for and so you're doing your part.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.340]   If everybody did what you did, we wouldn't have these problems.
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.380]   But again, ultimately I think it's political.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:27.580]   It's a political problem and it's a political solution.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:33.660]   Something happened, I saw a chart recently that something happened in I believe 1972
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:40.420]   where the success of companies and the wages were about the same and they diverged.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.140]   This is an amazing website.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:45.140]   I did want to tell people about this.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:49.700]   WTF happened in 1971.com.
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:50.700]   71.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.060]   And it was an inflection point.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:57:02.020]   And yet 71.72 you could see right here that prior to 72 compensation and productivity
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:06.100]   matched two lines going up together.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:12.460]   Then all of a sudden for some reason this divergence productivity continued going up
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:17.100]   and up and up it's up 246 percent since 1972.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:20.980]   Actually no, it's but more than 100 percent since 97, 250 percent.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.380]   But compensation flatten out.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:24.620]   This is what you were talking about.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:29.820]   Oh, and if only there was some show that you could rewind and listen to the first 15 minutes.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.820]   Exactly what you were saying, Mr.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.740]   What a what a what a ball these your dean.
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.740]   Your deans.
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:38.220]   Oh, I'm so camera.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:41.220]   Wages.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.220]   We need to fix that.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.220]   Flat.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:47.780]   But that's just that gets one very telling graph.
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:55.420]   But if you go through this whole page graph after graph housing the food everything everything
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:58:00.780]   is the again is the biggest scam in the world that rich people tell poor people.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.340]   It's not my problem.
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:03.700]   We have corporate welfare.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.900]   I'm not worried about John who's struggling to get food and needs a wick card.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:14.940]   I'm worried about Cook who's got money out the wazoo hidden in other countries and saying,
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:18.740]   well, we need more tax breaks and we need more credits because we've got to build a spaceship
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:22.980]   in the middle of the forest that only occupies 2 percent of our company.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.820]   But we need this spaceship because we care about the environment.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:28.620]   Those are the people that are causing the problem.
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.820]   But you know, America, the world.
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:36.340]   Look at the consumer price index because while your wages have been flat, the consumer
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:40.660]   price index, 1971, all of a sudden through the roof.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:45.420]   So in effect, your incomes buy in less and less.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.700]   Not only is your income flat, but you're getting less and less.
[01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:52.860]   This is not honestly for my iPhones.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:56.540]   I know I'm giving less and less.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:59:04.060]   This is not a prognosis that has anything but a nightmare at the end of it.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:11.140]   I just don't feel like the future is bright when you see this kind of thing going on.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.580]   Look at the national debt.
[01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:13.580]   1970.
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:17.780]   You know how I was like this?
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:18.780]   Rome.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:20.780]   Had a ground.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.700]   By the way, Rome was amazing.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:25.780]   It was probably just a whole historical coincidence.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:35.900]   But in the year 600 AD, the Antonine Plague widely considered to be the cause of the fall
[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:38.260]   of the Roman Empire.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:41.940]   It was already shaky and then a plague hit.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:44.060]   All right.
[01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:47.060]   History repeats itself.
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:49.580]   But the black plague, we have Black Friday.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:52.100]   It's all going to repeat itself.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:56.220]   Here's the S&P 500 price to earnings ratio.
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.220]   Throw the roof.
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.100]   And then suddenly it collapsed in 2010.
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:00.660]   I don't know what that's all about.
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.100]   This is a really interesting site.
[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:10.220]   I'm not an economist, but I think whoever put this together found some interesting statistics
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.620]   that really make you think, wonder what's going on, but really the most telling one is
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:19.100]   just flat income increase compared to productivity.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:27.420]   If I had to guess, I would guess that the number one cause of all of this is globalization,
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:32.740]   which we weren't really talking about it in the 70s, but it was starting to happen.
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:33.740]   It was happening.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.740]   Yeah.
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:35.740]   Yeah.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:41.460]   And so I think that globalization, as Owen was intimating, is something where you can
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:44.300]   play different economies off of each other.
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:49.740]   You can design it in California and then manufacture it in Shenzhen or whatever.
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.860]   You can manufacture it in a very cheap place and then sell it in a very rich place.
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:59.660]   And then you can mess around with all this kind of stuff.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:07.540]   We complain a lot about the nature of commerce in the United States, but my God, you should
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.780]   see it in other countries, Leo.
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:17.660]   We travel to a lot of countries where the locals literally have no access to anything, except
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.820]   the lowest quality cheapest garbage, you can imagine.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:27.460]   Their soap, their blankets, their clothes, their shoes, everything they see, everything
[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:34.180]   they get is just the worst kind of toxic polyester garbage.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:44.620]   And so we've seen it actually happen in Morocco, for example, which has this amazing culture
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:48.780]   of textile manufacturing, Berber textiles and so on, and people selling it and all this
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:49.780]   stuff.
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:54.260]   Well, now you see those being replaced by made in China versions, knockoffs of the traditional
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:55.340]   culture.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.780]   And so the sort of indigenous people, it's also happening in the Americas.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:09.340]   These people are selling Chinese knockoffs of their own cultures, patterns for pennies.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:14.540]   And I mean, it's just where do you think all those mega hats are made?
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.580]   Exactly, or the Trump ties.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:24.980]   But globalization is kind of like one of the big problems.
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:30.700]   And I think we need to really start addressing the downsides of globalization.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:35.500]   You look at the politics of populism.
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:42.700]   Again, I don't want to get in politics or name names, but basically the populism is essentially
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:49.980]   railing against lower wages being made, stuff being made abroad instead of here.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:51.660]   That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.620]   It's hard to, it's the 70s.
[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:54.980]   It's complicated, right?
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:56.740]   It's really complicated.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.860]   And I'm not an economist.
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.180]   You can also find false correlations.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.460]   People are talking about going off the gold standard.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:05.460]   That happened.
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:11.780]   The number of lawyers per thousand people doubled from 1971 to today.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:14.420]   I don't, is that causation?
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.980]   The incarceration rate?
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:21.020]   Well, that's because we never got rid of slavery in America.
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:23.180]   We just have a jail system.
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:28.700]   They're looking underwear for victory is secret for a 13th time today and brooms and other
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:30.100]   things to make.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:36.660]   So, you know, the share of 25 to 29 year olds living with their parents, the median age
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.780]   at first marriage.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:44.900]   These are probably the effects of their of, as opposed trends in obesity, the number of
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:49.100]   the growth of physicians and administrators in healthcare.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.180]   I mean, this is a fascinating page.
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:53.180]   Huh?
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:54.780]   So that's what a money is at.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:55.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:58.700]   I mean, be a lawyer or be a hospital administrator.
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:01.620]   WTF happened in 1971.com.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:06.740]   It doesn't have any answers, but it's a fascinating page to look at.
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:07.740]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:10.980]   And I think that first graph may be the most telling one.
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:12.580]   So yeah.
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:15.380]   We also talk about some of the socials.
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:19.860]   The social networks, the Twitters, the Facebooks, the TikToks.
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.820]   How about this poor guy?
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:26.540]   This poor guy, here you got a millennial really coming up with a great idea.
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.700]   He worked at Sherwin Williams.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:32.180]   You know, every once in a while, customer to ask for some paint.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:34.060]   He'd make a TikTok.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:36.060]   That's the same on names.
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.540]   He'd mix some paint, put some nice music behind it.
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:42.460]   This is blue and magenta mixed together.
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:47.060]   He would take requests for color mixing.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:51.260]   He said, you know, I thought this would be a good way to help market our paints.
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:52.260]   It is a good way.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.180]   It is a good way.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:58.420]   Millions of people, 1.2 million followers, tonedster paints.
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:04.980]   He got fired because he was making TikToks on the job.
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:11.860]   The company said he was, it was gross misconduct, wasting properties and facilities and seriously
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:14.780]   embarrassing the company or its products.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:19.140]   Now, if I were Kelly Moore or Benjamin Moore or some other paint company, I would hire
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:21.740]   this guy so fast.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:22.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:25.220]   So, I mean, with the shoot done, I said, okay, you know what?
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:26.220]   That's your job now.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.740]   You're part of the market department and you're going to make TikToks for us.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:31.740]   Yeah.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:34.660]   And they would have made bank because this is great marketing.
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:38.820]   Instead, people are going to be boycotting this company because they're so stupid.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:39.820]   Stupid.
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:43.300]   They fired him because he was giving out the secret sauce.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:44.540]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:49.500]   You can't tell people what you always got to do is squeeze into two points.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:56.260]   You know I charge you $97 for this custom can of paint and Marco just gave it away for
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:57.260]   free.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:00.540]   Side note, anybody watching and listening, if you want to learn how to do anything, if
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:04.420]   you want to pay actual corporation for everybody is driving it, you don't take that.
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:05.420]   Okay.
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:08.700]   If you want to know how to make these chicken wings, if you look at this, that's blueberries.
[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:12.300]   If you put blueberries in the paint, if you want to know how to get the best deal on
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:17.580]   the car or a leased car, go to TikTok, type in car leases and you will find out the world.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:19.620]   People dressing this on age out all over the place.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:20.620]   Thank you so much, TikTok.
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:24.620]   Sorry for you, paint guy, but you know, you weren't getting paid to make them anyway.
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:28.100]   So just go, you say, go on to somebody else and then give out their secrets and hopefully
[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:29.900]   hire and this guy.
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:30.900]   This guy's actually a genius.
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:37.700]   I mean, the world of paint is so boring and he made it really fun and interesting and
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:39.100]   it's just, it's just incredible.
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:42.740]   Yeah, but I agree with you, Leo, that the competition should hire this guy and just let
[02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:43.740]   them run away with the ideas.
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:44.740]   Such an opportunity.
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:45.740]   This is just fantastic.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.740]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:47.740]   People saying, did he pay for the paint?
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:52.380]   In every case, he said, no, I was mixing paint for customers and I just videotaped my
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:53.380]   job.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:55.140]   That was just, I was doing my job.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.180]   I made a video out of it.
[02:06:57.180 --> 02:06:58.180]   Sauce.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:03.820]   Did you, that, if you not watched SpongeBob, okay, there's a sauce trying to get to crab
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   paddy sauce.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.820]   You can't give out the secret sauce.
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.820]   Can't give out the crabby patty sauce.
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.980]   That's why you got the trouble.
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.700]   I'll foresight, but I mean, like I said, that paint's expensive, bro.
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:14.700]   You get custom paint.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:15.700]   It's a lot of money.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:19.940]   If I just go and buy this little $5 tube and another $5 tube and he put blueberries
[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:23.020]   in the paint to make blueberry color.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.020]   Actual blueberries.
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:25.980]   Don't give that one away.
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.980]   Anybody could do that.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:31.020]   You got to get that mixer box though that shakes it really hard.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.020]   Yeah.
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:33.020]   Yeah.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:34.780]   Or a, I saw him use a wooden stick to uncle Lee.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.820]   I mean, you can buy it or you can use it.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:37.820]   Like, whip it.
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:39.660]   Yeah, I mean, America.
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:44.140]   Hey, our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:49.100]   It's actually right up the alley of what we were talking about, which is internet service
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:57.060]   providers predacious, credit-preying on their customers.
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:59.940]   Comcast, AT&T.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:04.180]   They're actually collecting information about what you're doing and selling it on to marketers,
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:06.140]   making big money from spying on you.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:09.380]   So we've talked about VPNs before for security reasons.
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.260]   It's a great reason to run a VPN.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.340]   But there's also a privacy factor.
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:17.380]   You don't want people to see what you're doing online.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:22.860]   You need to use a VPN, especially if your internet service provider snooping on you.
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:24.540]   That's why I love ExpressVPN.
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:26.540]   Couldn't be easier to use.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:30.620]   And now remember, if you do choose a VPN, they're going to have the same potential to
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.860]   spy on you as your ISP.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:34.660]   You're just kicking the can down the road.
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:38.220]   That's why I only use ExpressVPN.
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:43.740]   These guys absolutely respect your privacy so much so they invented a new server technology
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:50.140]   they call Trusted Server that runs only in RAM, spins up when you log in, cannot write
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:51.140]   to the hard drive.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:54.460]   It's sandbox and then spins down, disappears when you log out.
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:57.380]   There is no trace of you ever using it.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:02.460]   And we know that's true not only because they have independent auditors, Price Waterhouse
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:07.380]   Cooper, checking their privacy policy, checking Trusted Server technology, making sure it
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:12.420]   works, not only because of that, but also because from time to time, law enforcement
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.740]   from countries with no knock warrants or no warrant at all will come and take the servers
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:21.860]   hoping to find evidence of things people have done on ExpressVPN and there's never anything
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:23.020]   on there.
[02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:25.220]   They never have found anything.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:26.220]   They don't log.
[02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.740]   So your privacy is 100% protected.
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:30.740]   Your security is 100%.
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:35.940]   Everything you do is encrypted and protected and with servers all over the world, ExpressVPN
[02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:40.820]   is fast, but it can also put you in any country in the world, which means you can watch Netflix
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:44.900]   in the UK and binge all the doctor who episodes you want.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:48.620]   Netflix and Japan and binge all the anime episodes you want.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.260]   It's so fast it works with HD streaming.
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.420]   It's easy to use.
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.500]   The apps are available on every platform.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:59.980]   You can even put ExpressVPN on your router, making sure your whole household is protected
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:00.980]   and you know what's great?
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:05.900]   It's so fast they'll never even notice that nobody's going to say, oh, wow, it's slow,
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:06.900]   but we're secure.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:07.900]   You don't have to say that anymore.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.540]   Not with ExpressVPN.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:14.340]   Your data is your business protected with the best VPN on the market today.
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:15.980]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.180]   It's the only one I use.
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:19.300]   Visit ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:24.180]   Get three extra months of VPN free when you buy a year.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:29.180]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:34.980]   Get yourself online, your privacy, your security, and watch TV anywhere you want in the world
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:36.700]   with ExpressVPN.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.420]   When you're in another country, there's so much content that is unavailable.
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:44.700]   It just pops up and says, "This is not available in your region."
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:46.780]   You use it the opposite way.
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:49.940]   As you travel around the world, you use it to be in the US.
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:50.940]   Exactly.
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:52.580]   I mean, use it as an exaggeration.
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:53.580]   It's running.
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:55.780]   I never think about it.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:11:00.940]   But my Pixelbook is always in Miami, no matter where I am.
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:04.260]   And so everything, just all the content is just there.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:05.540]   And I don't even think about it.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:06.540]   It's just always running.
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.300]   Your Pixelbook says, "Am I in heaven or am I in Miami?"
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:16.340]   Yes, if you find the road, just put your VPN to England and you will get all kinds of
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:17.340]   stuff.
[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:18.340]   You can get back.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:19.580]   It's a pretty little habit.
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:21.180]   What else did you want to talk about the socials?
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.300]   Do you want to talk about Twitter?
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:26.380]   And using stories and their fleets.
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:27.380]   I don't like them.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.580]   I'm grandpa on that.
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.820]   I'm tired of stories on every single thing.
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:31.820]   I don't like it.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:35.820]   I miss my periscope live when I can just see people actually go online and watch them.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:37.780]   I don't want stories on everything.
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:44.100]   I'm tired of Snapchat invading every social network by Humbug.
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:50.260]   Those fleets, besides having the worst name ever, terrible.
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.300]   I believe, if they say the name of us.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.300]   It's an enema.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:54.300]   It's an enema.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.300]   It is.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:56.300]   It is.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.300]   So, I do that.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.940]   Well, now you do.
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:01.420]   My favorite thing on Twitter is, "Check out my new fleet."
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:03.420]   Bro, don't tweet about the fleet.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.300]   If you just tweet it then.
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:09.980]   It goes by so fast anyway.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.380]   I don't need that on Twitter.
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:15.100]   It's a really dumb system the way it works.
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:16.580]   It doesn't work in your browser.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:18.220]   It's only on the mobile phone.
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:21.260]   And then the comments on it go into your messages.
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:26.020]   So now I did a couple of fleets and now my messages are blowing up with all these comments.
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:30.900]   And most of the comments are emojis of a heart or clapping or something like that.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:33.500]   It's such a waste of time.
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:41.100]   Stories on Instagram, except for the people who really abuse it and do 50 segments all
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:45.020]   in a row, it kind of works for that platform.
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:50.140]   But it's just not a Twitter-like thing and they didn't implement it very well.
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:57.900]   So hopefully they'll either get rid of it or they will fix it and make it work better.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:12:59.500]   You're going to fleet forever.
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:00.740]   I'm just great.
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:01.740]   I don't know what it is.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:02.740]   It just is what it is.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:05.260]   But you know what I hear doing.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.660]   So Leo, I have an airing of grievances as well.
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:09.660]   All right.
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.980]   You've asked a small there quickly.
[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:13.580]   Yeah, go ahead.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:16.580]   You've already covered this because this is a two-week-old story.
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:22.300]   But I'm really, really honked at Google for what they did with Google Photos.
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:28.140]   And I don't think that people are understanding how bad this transcription really was.
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.620]   I will debate you on this.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:30.620]   I will debate.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:34.980]   So the news story is a couple of weeks ago, we all got emails saying, "Hey, look, we've
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:40.180]   been giving you free unlimited storage on Google Photos.
[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:42.260]   But we're not going to do that anymore."
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:49.020]   Everything in June of next year, June 5th, I think, fourth, whatever first.
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.700]   First everything you upload is going to start counting against your total amount of storage.
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:57.060]   And if you need more, you could buy Google One and you only get 15 gigs free.
[02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:02.100]   Everything you got there up to now, in fact, anything you upload now, all the way to June
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.700]   first is going to stay free forever.
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:05.700]   Right?
[02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:06.700]   Right.
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:07.860]   What's wrong with that?
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:09.580]   They gave us a lot of notice.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:11.380]   Here's what's wrong with it.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:18.180]   So first of all, I have 22 gigs of photos and videos on Google Photos.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:20.220]   But I also pay for the storage.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.580]   So it's not going to cost me personally anything.
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:28.660]   But I have recommended Google Photos to lots of people, millions of people over the last
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:30.340]   five years.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:36.540]   And so when they rolled this out, they said they were offering free unlimited photo storage.
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:43.220]   And we accepted them a dragooning all of our loved ones into their facial recognition
[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:44.220]   system.
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:49.140]   We accepted them compressing it so that when we download a version of the photo, we get
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:50.380]   a compressed version.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:51.980]   It's not the original.
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:57.500]   We accepted buying into their ecosystem all the stuff that we did.
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:01.180]   And we did it because they said it was free and unlimited.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:06.700]   And we made a decision about where to put our photos based on the deal that we had with
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.820]   them that we would do our part, all the things aforementioned, and they would do their part.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:13.780]   It would be free and unlimited.
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:17.540]   And now they come along and they're saying, okay, well, now we're going to charge you.
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.220]   Now the amount they're charging is actually very low.
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:21.220]   It's a low price.
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:25.340]   And I have the feeling it's not about the revenue from charging people for photos.
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:31.060]   It's more about getting you into their system with your credit card and all that kind of
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:33.180]   stuff the way Amazon does.
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:36.220]   Nevertheless, a deal is a deal and they broke the deal.
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:40.820]   Now we have many, many people have gigabytes and gigabytes of data.
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:42.980]   It's actually too much to download.
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:44.940]   People say, well, just go to Google Takeout.
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.580]   You can just launch a thing.
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:52.980]   So I've asked a lot of my newsletter readers if this works for them and a shocking number
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:59.460]   of them have said they've tried it and it simply doesn't work for lots of people including
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:00.460]   myself.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:03.580]   You cannot download your own photos.
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:05.460]   You can download them one at a time.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:11.420]   I have 20 gigabytes of photos from Google Photos and was able to do it.
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:12.420]   Some people take it.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.060]   Many people are able to do it and many people are not.
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:20.300]   What happens with me, and I'm using a Google laptop, I'm using a Pixelbook, right?
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:25.780]   I go in there and I initiate the process and literally nothing happens.
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:29.460]   I say, okay, we'll notify you, I don't even get a notification.
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:30.540]   I don't get anything.
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:31.540]   I don't get the download.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:33.580]   I don't get nothing happens.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.340]   It doesn't work.
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:41.940]   And so they either have to, for people for whom this doesn't work, they need to send you
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:44.900]   a free hard disk with all of your stuff.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.900]   Or as far as I'm concerned, this is technically a financial crime.
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:51.100]   It's bait and switch.
[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:56.580]   They basically said, people were taking photos with the knowledge that it's free storage.
[02:16:56.580 --> 02:17:00.580]   So people are taking 10 times more photos than they otherwise would have.
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:02.900]   And they've chosen this service that was free.
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:08.500]   And now they've got more data than people can download.
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:12.100]   And in many cases, the downloads don't even work at all.
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:17.900]   So I think this is something that really demands a lawsuit.
[02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:24.820]   But if you don't upload anything more, if they said to me, oh no, now you've got to
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:27.900]   delete it if you're not going to pay for it, that would be different.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:32.700]   But they're not going to count what is up there up to June 1st against any total.
[02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:34.500]   They're going to keep it forever.
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:36.860]   I mean, for everybody, it's a mighty long time.
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.420]   Nobody wants half their photos on one service and half their photos on another service.
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:46.020]   So I could go to smug mug and start using some other service.
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:50.500]   But now I have these two things going on.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:51.500]   It's just a really long time.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.180]   Yeah, but Mike, I mean, that's just because...
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:54.180]   Yeah.
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:58.940]   You should have just bought a hard drive and put them on the freaking hard drive.
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:17:59.940]   I should have.
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:03.220]   Well, I've been saying for a long time, people should have Wasabi.
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.620]   And I know they're not advertising on this particular show.
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:06.620]   Wasabi.
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.620]   That's a cheap one.
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:08.620]   And you can do it.
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:15.660]   So I have, after taking photos for 20 years, pretty prolifically, I have about a terabyte.
[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:18.620]   I could buy a two terabyte drive for a hundred bucks.
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:19.620]   You've got to have...
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:20.620]   You've got to have it in the cloud also.
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:21.620]   Somewhere.
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:22.620]   Somebody could steal that hard drive.
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:23.620]   Like, what's his name?
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:24.620]   The movie director.
[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:25.620]   So...
[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:26.620]   Got his strength on.
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:29.580]   I'm in the dark because Mike makes me snitching all people.
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:30.580]   I don't want people to...
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:31.580]   Shh.
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:32.580]   I've got a couple of friends.
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:34.220]   Nobody knows what's going on.
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:35.220]   We don't know who this is.
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:36.220]   It's some stranger.
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.940]   I guess somebody picked up with Dad.
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:41.940]   This is coffee to decaf.
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:44.700]   How many pictures do you have on Google Photos?
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:47.460]   I have nine terabytes of pictures of...
[02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:48.460]   Holy cow!
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:49.460]   Oh, come on.
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:50.460]   That's your the problem.
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:53.260]   You're the problem.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:58.460]   Every single photo that my Dad ever took when he passed away, I upload all those immediately.
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:00.540]   I do photography and videography.
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.260]   I do stuff for companies.
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:05.740]   Everything that I've ever done gets backed up in two ways.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:07.220]   In the Google Photos.
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:10.860]   And I also get a hard drive and I back up and I send it to my friend in California who
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:11.860]   puts it in the safe.
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:14.220]   So I got, you know, by coastal in case he goes off.
[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:16.220]   So you're good?
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:17.220]   You're good?
[02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:18.220]   So, but I...
[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:20.820]   Google right now can literally just charge me whatever.
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:21.820]   I got to do it.
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.220]   So, I mean, Mike, I hear what you're saying, but they did get there something out.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:28.660]   They said, "Hey, look, at this time we're going to stop, but you keep everything free."
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:31.700]   So if I stop right now, I'm happy with this ATB's.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:35.140]   So, TV's, I got to sit up and I'm going to upload some more stuff.
[02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:36.940]   I got cursed, I got to upload.
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:38.340]   But it's been a great service.
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:39.980]   I thank you everybody at Google.
[02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:40.980]   I know I'm an abuser.
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:42.820]   You know, I don't want to get it.
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:43.820]   Holy cow.
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:44.820]   Holy cow.
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:47.180]   Work that system to the boat.
[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:49.900]   I also pay my little $20 a year for 100 Meg risk.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.260]   Laura is listening right now.
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:54.820]   She's making a note in her little black book.
[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:57.460]   You find that Owen, J.J.G.
[02:19:57.460 --> 02:19:58.620]   Let me say something.
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.020]   If it's free, it's for me.
[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:01.020]   They said free.
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:02.020]   It's free.
[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:03.020]   You did it.
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:04.540]   You didn't break any rules.
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:07.340]   I was doing a 100 gigs a night.
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:08.860]   Every night I just had badges.
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:10.660]   I wake up and the X-1 was done.
[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:11.660]   They blew.
[02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:13.500]   Thank you, Google.
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:17.940]   I think Google does take a hit when they cancel something like this or change something.
[02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:22.700]   But honestly, because you got burned, we all got burned by Google+.
[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:24.540]   There's been a lot of things.
[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:26.700]   Google Reader and Google Reader.
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:28.140]   But come on.
[02:20:28.140 --> 02:20:31.060]   I mean, they were given away a free service.
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:39.500]   If YouTube went away, I guess the one point you make that I think is genuinely an issue
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:47.140]   is you did give them these photos, which they got a lot of value out of with ML training.
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:50.420]   That was the whole reason for it, I'm sure, for Google's point of view.
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:52.740]   We want to train artificial intelligence.
[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:54.980]   So they got some value out of it.
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:59.540]   But I don't think it's unfair of them to say, "Hey, look, we can't afford to do this anymore.
[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:03.340]   In six months, we're going to have to charge you a not unreasonable amount of for cloud
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:04.860]   storage."
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:08.740]   But everything you put up there, including all of Owen's nine terabytes, will stay there
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:09.740]   for free forever.
[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:10.740]   That seems fair.
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:13.100]   I'm not even mad about that.
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:16.980]   I hear what you're saying, Mike, but that's the one thing I'm not grandpa on.
[02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:20.820]   If they were to say I had to pay for all that I got up there, "Oh, man, I'll be burning
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:22.020]   this house down with you, Mike.
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:24.260]   I'll be right there with a pinch for it."
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:27.740]   They gave me a ton of frames and said, "Now, again, I got to see what the price is because
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:28.740]   I still be uploading.
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.540]   So I got to figure out what's going on.
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:34.580]   But I'm thankful that my stuff is up there with the Google's quote unquote "safe and
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:35.580]   sound."
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:40.140]   Mike, do you feel like maybe you're kind of at the end of your rope with Google?
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:42.780]   Like they've burnt you one time too many.
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:43.780]   I have.
[02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:48.380]   So here's the theme that this feeds into.
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:51.060]   Google is really unskillful.
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:55.780]   They have passionate users and time and time again, they launch a new thing and they say,
[02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:58.380]   "Hey, passionate users, check out this new thing."
[02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:01.540]   And then people get super invested in it.
[02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:06.060]   I've personally spent hundreds of hours interacting with Google Photos and I'm very invested in
[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:07.060]   it.
[02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:09.380]   I have this thing called a nice book, which was my replacement for Facebook.
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:13.700]   I've gotten all my readers to be subscribers of this thing.
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:16.460]   I've gotten everybody involved in this and I've promoted it.
[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:19.540]   I use it for Gassarum experiences.
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:23.060]   We take professional quality photos and then we share them through Google Photos.
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:30.300]   So our customers of our business actually, we've said, "This is where all the photos
[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:33.700]   and videos from this experience are."
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:39.820]   And so I don't mind that they have something that's free and then they monetize it.
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:43.900]   What I mind is they didn't tell us that at the beginning.
[02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:49.540]   In the beginning they said free and unlimited and they made everybody believe that this
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:51.340]   is always going to be free.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:55.460]   Now I've always been nervous about this because I know that people like Owen are abusing this
[02:22:55.460 --> 02:22:56.460]   horribly.
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:58.420]   I actually thought I was an abuser.
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:02.300]   And now an unknown contributor.
[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:04.300]   You're so so funny.
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:05.300]   You're so funny.
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.300]   You're so funny.
[02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:07.300]   You're so funny.
[02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:08.300]   You're so funny.
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:10.740]   See how many buses we can throw all over.
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:14.180]   But one show.
[02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:20.020]   They should have said at the beginning, "It's free for now."
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:21.500]   They should have been clear about it.
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:22.500]   But they-
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:23.500]   But come on.
[02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:24.500]   You're in the real world.
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:28.220]   You know that anything- nothing is free forever necessarily.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:30.820]   Everything is free for now.
[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:35.380]   We assume Facebook is always going to be free because they're monetizing us elsewhere.
[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:40.700]   We assume that shipping on Amazon is free because they're monetizing it elsewhere.
[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.700]   They're not all-
[02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:43.700]   But they're not all-
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:44.700]   The last of the crime prices have gone up.
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:46.780]   They told me prime was going to be $99 a year.
[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:49.380]   Now it's $119 and it's $129.
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:51.940]   Netflix told me that I was going to be paying $8.99 a month.
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:53.500]   And now it's up to $17.99.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:54.660]   Like things change.
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:55.660]   Things change.
[02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:56.660]   Things change.
[02:23:56.660 --> 02:24:01.400]   The difference is that, yeah, but the difference is that you can just switch from being a prime
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:02.400]   user to something else.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.400]   It's like there's no-
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.400]   What are you going to switch?
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:06.400]   I can't get my own photos.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:07.400]   Oh, you're not.
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:08.400]   Are you shipping?
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:09.400]   I'm just switching.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:10.400]   I'm not switching.
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:17.180]   Well, I'm trying to use non-Amazon sources for the things that I buy.
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:18.580]   I'm trying harder to do that.
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:19.860]   But that, not for that reason.
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:24.940]   But my point is there's a heavy, heavy lock-in when your most precious data, your photos
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:32.140]   and videos of your family and all that kind of stuff, are being held hostage in this,
[02:24:32.140 --> 02:24:34.900]   in undown notable quantities.
[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:38.260]   And in some cases, literally undown notable because their mechanism doesn't work and
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:40.640]   no, they don't have tech support.
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:43.000]   And you're just kind of stuck.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.000]   This is, I used to, before I was a tech journalist, I was a regular journalist at a newspaper.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.720]   And we used to do a lot of stories about local businesses that would do bait and switch.
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.600]   One of the first stories I ever wrote was about a motel in the town that I lived in that
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.520]   said, "Oh, it's $29 a night."
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.840]   And you could never get that $29 room.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:04.320]   They'd get you off the freeway, get you committed, you waste your time finding the place.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.400]   You go in, you park, you go inside.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:12.580]   And they're like, "Well, those rooms are taken, but you can get this other one for $29.95."
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:15.580]   And they paid a huge fine for bait and switch.
[02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.860]   That's exactly what Google is doing.
[02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:18.860]   It's a bait and switch.
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:21.140]   They said, "They told us the deal was one thing.
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:22.820]   They got us all committed."
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:26.460]   And now they're saying, "Now that you're committed, we're changing the deal."
[02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:29.700]   And I think that people should be angrier than they are.
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:30.700]   And then--
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:31.700]   People are angry.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:32.700]   They don't get it.
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:35.500]   There are a lot of people share your point of view on this.
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:41.880]   But again, the theme is that they are unreliable and they take their passionate users and they
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.000]   crap all over them again and again.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:52.000]   And so if you're an active user, like everybody who listens to this podcast is, you shouldn't.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.640]   You probably don't, but you shouldn't trust Google as far as you can throw them.
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:02.640]   They are an unreliable company that just doesn't not give a crap about you.
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:04.480]   And they're proven once again.
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:06.120]   I can't say otherwise.
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:12.800]   And I think that is really the big business risk Google seems to be charging into as they
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:17.240]   cancel projects left and right is that people just have lost trust.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.080]   And Google Stadia is a good example.
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:24.760]   I think a lot of people are very reluctant to go all in on Stadia.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:28.200]   When you buy a game on Stadia, that's theirs.
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:33.720]   If Stadia goes away, that's 60 bucks I paid for Cyberpunk 2077 and goes away too.
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:37.680]   I don't get a copy I can download and play on some other machine.
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:39.240]   That's it, right?
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:44.040]   So I don't know, but it will go away if there are histories, any guide, right?
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:46.640]   I'll go who trusts who trusts them at this point.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.640]   Nobody, right?
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.720]   This shows relations to Google and conversations.
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:55.800]   Do all my do not reflect or inflect my relation to Google.
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:56.800]   I love you.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:57.800]   I run on G.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:26:59.520]   I don't run on dunk and I run on G.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.520]   I do this email.
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.040]   My personal G my kids.
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:04.400]   I think it's run through Google.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:05.760]   I'm so thankful to you.
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:07.280]   Do not delete any of my stuff.
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:09.000]   I know I don't even want to download it right now.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.760]   I just want to preserve it in case I get hit by a truck and my daughter needs everything
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:14.480]   in my life in one place.
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:15.480]   That's true.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.400]   I thank you so much for all the welcome, Arne, and for Stadia overlords.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:19.400]   Yeah.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:20.680]   But seriously, you mentioned Gmail.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:21.680]   I'm actually Leo.
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:23.600]   This is the biggest thing that I'm considering.
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:27.480]   I'm trying to really think through all the implications, but I'm thinking about getting
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:33.000]   off Gmail and going to hay, which I already pay for hay, but I'm thinking of a bad
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000]   abandoning Gmail.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.360]   It's a little scary because I've been on it forever.
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:42.480]   I abandoned them a long time ago, actually moved to Fastmail, which is a service I pay
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:44.480]   for.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.720]   It's not cheap, but it's not expensive.
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:48.720]   I don't know.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.600]   It's like 50 bucks a year or something.
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:55.520]   But I feel like I want to support a good-- it's better than Gmail, frankly, a good
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:58.920]   IMAP server and support it.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.200]   Now, the thing about Gmail is there's not really any lock in on any email program.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.280]   You can easily move over to another email program.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:11.880]   You should not use a Gmail address or a Fastmail address or a Hotmail address as your main
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:12.880]   address.
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:13.880]   You should have your own domain.
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:14.880]   Right.
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:20.320]   And that's what I'm waiting for for hay to have the custom domains, which they said they
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.320]   are going to have.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.720]   Well, I mean, I think it's-- what is it?
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:24.520]   75 bucks a year or something like that?
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:26.160]   It is a little pricey.
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:27.960]   But it's pretty great.
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:29.720]   So I'm probably going to do it.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:30.720]   It's funny.
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:36.760]   I had a hay account, and I just said, I asked, screw it, and I didn't pay for it.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:38.240]   But I don't feel like it was that good.
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:40.120]   I really like Fastmail.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.720]   That's a really interesting-- I think you're right, though, that Google has probably harmed
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:45.200]   their reputation.
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:50.040]   But frankly, at this point, it looks like the only thing Google knows how to do is search
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:51.680]   and advertising.
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:54.320]   And that's the only money comes from that, and that's the only thing they know how to
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:55.320]   do.
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:58.480]   You can't count on anything else for any length.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:02.360]   I blame Sundar Pichai, who I think has no vision.
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:04.400]   And he's just a clerk.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:07.840]   And I think he's just really wrecked Google.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.680]   And the founders of Air and Sergey have-- they've totally checked out.
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:14.200]   They've got their yacht.
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:17.760]   And their live aboard airplanes and whatever.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.960]   But let's hear from the sunglasses factions.
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:28.440]   You can associate a Snapchat launches a TikTok-like feed called Spotlight, kickstarted by paying
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:29.520]   creators.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:32.920]   I wonder if there is a story in that that we could go to.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:38.760]   I'm going to call it Meets, Fleets, Weets, Teets.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:39.760]   Teets.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:40.760]   How about Tweets?
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:43.160]   Oh, I can't use that.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:45.720]   At this point, I get-- I don't know.
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:51.000]   Do you use Snapchat still?
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.840]   Under the age of 18, Snapchat is your life plan.
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:55.840]   It's still the thing.
[02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:56.840]   It's still the thing.
[02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:06.640]   TikTok is like what you get to see, but the Snapchat lifestyle is a real underground network
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:08.880]   of stuff that's going on behind the scenes.
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:13.920]   So you think they have a chance to go-- I mean, one way they might have a chance, and maybe
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:18.000]   the reason they're doing this, is it's still up in the air that TikTok might be forced
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.600]   out of business by the US government, in which case I can imagine creators saying,
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:26.320]   "Well, Snapchat's not a bad place to move to."
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:27.960]   They can't stop TikTok.
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.240]   I'm not even worried about that.
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:31.000]   That's such a pipe dream.
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.800]   That's telling me that you're creating a school that's going to magically educate people,
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:36.800]   or you've got a college degree, or you didn't--
[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:43.880]   Oh, the US government has some-- you may not think they have some tools at their--
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:44.880]   disposal.
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:49.200]   If the Commerce Department decides to cut off all the bank accounts and say nobody can
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:55.320]   sell servers in the United States to TikTok, they're going to pretty much put them on business.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:01.880]   I've seen mayors and governors bow to the feet of protesters this year.
[02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:04.000]   Yeah, who would have thought that, right?
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:09.800]   Don't understand the power of humanity until all of your children have knives at your throat
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:10.800]   when you come home.
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:13.120]   I wish you would cut off TikTok.
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:14.120]   You want to see my little--
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:15.120]   That's true.
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:16.120]   You want to see my little people--
[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.120]   That's a good point.
[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:21.920]   I wish you would cut these children at the feet because Lord knows it'd be Lord of the
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:24.760]   Flies up in this piece within two days.
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:26.520]   They'd be, "Oh, running, rubbing."
[02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:27.520]   Go ahead.
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:28.520]   Try it.
[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:32.200]   Shut it down for 48 hours, and watch what happens to the United States of America.
[02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:37.520]   We may find out by the next-- the next tweet, they've been given one week to sell off the
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.480]   US business and avoid a ban.
[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:47.800]   Of course, they were given one week back in August, but they were given another one week.
[02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:52.320]   The Treasury Department told CNBC that Cepheus, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:57.240]   US, had granted an extension to allow time to review a revised submission.
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:04.480]   Remember, it was Oracle with some help from Walmart that was trying to acquire TikTok
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:07.480]   from ByteDance.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:12.760]   And then TikTok-- we talked about this a couple of weeks ago-- said, "Hello?
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:13.760]   Hello?
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:16.400]   Is anybody there?
[02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:18.520]   What happened?
[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:20.200]   Should we still sell?"
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:24.400]   And then Cepheus said, "Oh, yeah, sell."
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:26.080]   TikTok has no comment.
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:27.320]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:31.240]   We're going to have a very interesting-- this story from CNBC was published today, four
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:32.240]   hours ago.
[02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:36.440]   So we're going to have a very interesting week.
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:37.440]   But you're right.
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:41.080]   I actually hope it happens, Owen, because that will be something to see.
[02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:44.040]   I just want to know-- I can't imagine.
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:50.960]   Like again, if you're in the TikTok universe, like my daughter, she asked me how to game
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:52.400]   the system.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.520]   And her third video got 100 and something thousand views.
[02:32:56.520 --> 02:33:00.320]   Now, she's got stuff where she's getting 50,000 likes and views and things on.
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:03.480]   And she's got kids at school coming up asking her for a shout out.
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:07.440]   The power of TikTok with kids, like as much as you get your niche and you know how to
[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:12.720]   play the game, like your viral ramp is much quicker and you get more opportunities to
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:14.720]   get shots at the top with TikTok.
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:15.720]   So what do you think?
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:18.720]   Well, TikTok just seems like they've been trying if it works something out.
[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:19.720]   Yeah.
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:21.440]   It'd be interesting if they just said, "Hey, go ahead.
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:22.440]   Shut us down.
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:23.440]   Let's see what happens."
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.440]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.320]   I'm sure some kind of financial deal is going to get put in place where somebody buys it
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:28.440]   or something happens.
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:32.880]   But just shutting down TikTok, I can't-- I just can't even imagine it.
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.880]   I can't imagine what happens.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:34.880]   Right?
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:35.880]   It's in the streets.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.880]   Make for an interesting week.
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:39.920]   Hey, we got-- this show is going to go on for another hour or two.
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.920]   No, no.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.800]   We're going to wrap it up because it's been going on and I don't want to keep you guys
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:45.040]   too much longer.
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.800]   We do want to though change the subject a little bit because we had a fun week and I
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:56.800]   had a special video I commissioned to illustrate what a good week we had this week on Twitter
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:58.880]   and I wanted you to watch.
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:02.280]   Obviously, Ant must have an incredibly cluttered desk.
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:03.280]   I did it.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:04.280]   Everything's right there.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:05.280]   Everything's right there.
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:06.280]   Everything's right there.
[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:08.920]   I just wiped this west-caught white here from a glasses.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:14.920]   This looks like some sort of DVI, the HDMI adapter here for some reason.
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.360]   There's also a quarter right here.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:21.160]   Previously on Twitter.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:22.160]   iOS today.
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:27.240]   And if you are looking to try a new recipe app, then crouton is a great app.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:32.760]   So you stand your iPad with Face ID and there's a play button at the top of every recipe and
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:34.400]   I'm doing this right now.
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.880]   And if I tap on the I button, then I can link to go to the next step and open your mouth
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:40.880]   to show the ingredients.
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:41.880]   Oh my god.
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:42.880]   Oh my god.
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:43.880]   I think there's six.
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:46.880]   You about want to save that for a read.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:47.880]   There you go, man.
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:48.880]   There's some stamps.
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:51.320]   It's all about Android.
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:52.760]   Episode 500.
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.760]   That's right.
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.760]   500 episodes we've been doing this show a very long time.
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:58.360]   I mean, kind of a rotating cast.
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:02.120]   Oh, all that Android alumni today.
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:03.120]   Smart tech today.
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:07.160]   Matthew, Cass and Ellie and I have some black Friday tips for you.
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:11.520]   The things you should go after, the things you shouldn't go after and how you plan to
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:15.000]   shop smart when it comes to the smart home.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.400]   This week in Google, I think this is a C-band.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:18.400]   Wow.
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.840]   In case I decide to give most of the sickness while podcasting.
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:25.360]   Yeah, my desk is rather cluttered, sir.
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:26.360]   Quit.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.960]   Unbelievable as always.
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:29.960]   And there was no Leo.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:32.800]   I'm just cluttered with a stack of gold.
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:34.760]   Holy, it's kind of a cry.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:35.760]   Oh, that's amazing.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.760]   Wow.
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:37.760]   That would be a great new show.
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:40.520]   I want to I want that to be a show like just go through the things like like I got a
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:41.520]   face here.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:42.960]   I got my polar.
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:45.320]   I got what's on your desk.
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:46.480]   I got a brush.
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.480]   I got some.
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:48.480]   I got some different.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:49.480]   I mean, I got a.
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:51.680]   I mean, I got some back clean.
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:52.680]   Freeze stuff.
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:54.240]   I got some beard oil.
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:55.240]   I got like.
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:56.840]   That would be a great show.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:58.480]   What is on your desk?
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:35:59.480]   This is this is amazing.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:00.840]   I got some Versati glasses.
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:01.840]   I got.
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:02.840]   Man, this is great.
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:03.840]   We should do that show.
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.840]   What kind of depressing because the week I took off is the best twig in years.
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:08.840]   So I don't.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.840]   I feel.
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:16.840]   A couple of obituaries, sad stories we're going to end the show with, but that's where
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.080]   I usually put them at the end of the show because we want to remember these people.
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:23.880]   Darth Vader has passed away at the age of 85.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:31.800]   David Prowse, who was the big tall guy in the Darth Vader costume, a six foot six former
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:33.120]   body builder.
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:39.680]   He was in the original trilogy and he passed away at the age of 85, much beloved.
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:46.240]   And then speaking of beloved, there is an entrepreneur who I think probably we all knew.
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:50.880]   We certainly all encountered from time to time.
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:37:00.400]   He Tony Shea, he created a link exchange when he was just out of college, sold it to Microsoft
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:07.480]   for hundreds of millions of dollars, took that money and founded Zappos in 1999.
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.280]   On one simple principle, the customer comes first.
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:17.440]   He sold it 10 years later to Amazon for more than a billion dollars, continued to run it
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:24.320]   until this summer when he retired at the age of 46.
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:31.320]   Sad to say, Tony, who was beloved by our community, passed away.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:38.640]   It sounds like it was a house fire, which is really on Thanksgiving, which is really
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.040]   tragic.
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:48.760]   If you want to read about what a great fellow this guy was, O'Malley has written a really
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:52.120]   good obituary at om.co.
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:57.080]   He of course knew Tony very well, but so did so many people in our community.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.000]   I only met him once at a South by Southwest.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.320]   He had a Zappos bust with a full bar that he was driving around Austin.
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:07.560]   It was so much fun.
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:09.320]   I'll never forget it.
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:10.320]   He was quirky.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.520]   He was innovative.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:13.840]   He was quite brilliant.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:20.000]   He really cared about customers.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.480]   He also cared about his employees.
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:25.720]   The thing that I ranted about earlier, hers my heart even more, knowing that somebody
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:33.040]   like him existed in the ether that gave so much and did it not just because, as a goodness
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.200]   of his heart, because he knew it was right and he knew that it would make a business
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:37.360]   better.
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.920]   He knew that treating his employees the right way, treating the customers the right way.
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:42.920]   Down to the little things.
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:48.280]   There was a story a long time ago about a guy who called Zappos customer service by accident
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:49.600]   instead of a pizza place.
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:53.760]   The guy ordered the guy a pizza for him anyway.
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:39:01.160]   The mindset of this man to instill from the top to the bottom is what I wish humane business
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:02.160]   would be.
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:03.160]   Yes, we're going to make a profit.
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.120]   Yes, we're going to make money, but we're going to do it by servicing the people that
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:10.760]   want to work with us and servicing the people that work for us.
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:14.520]   And if we started with that, if this guy, we could just multiply him and have him run
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:17.720]   everything, rest in peace, we would be much better off.
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:19.440]   He did an amazing job.
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:23.800]   He created an amazing company and culture and he touched so many lives of people that
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.200]   worked for him under him that are going to go off and do other great things and hopefully
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:33.040]   take his lessons and his spirit and his essence with them into the future.
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:35.440]   So again, rest in peace and Tony.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:42.320]   My friend Jason Rapp tweeted him, tweeted about Tony Shea.
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:48.640]   Apparently at one point, 13,000 Zappos customers orders were one day late.
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:49.840]   He sent them an email.
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:52.080]   He still had the email and Jason tweeted it.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:53.080]   This is embarrassing.
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:58.320]   He made an apology and said, "Instead of your order being delivered July 8th as we promised
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.600]   is not expected to be delivered July 9th.
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:05.200]   If this is causing you undue hardship, please call our customer service line.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.160]   We will bend over backwards to make it right.
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:11.920]   If it isn't causing you undue hardship but is just extremely annoying, please call us
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:16.360]   and ask whoever answers the phone to do something weird or embarrassing, like sing "I'm
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:21.840]   a little tea cup" or do their best audio impression of a cute little kitten.
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.840]   You trust us and we failed."
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:24.080]   I mean, that's customer service.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:30.480]   He often said, "Zappos is a customer service organization that just happens to sell shoes."
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.280]   He was very instrumental in the revitalization of downtown Las Vegas.
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:44.200]   46, way too young and a huge loss to our industry.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:48.320]   RIP Tony Shea.
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.800]   I think we should wrap it up on that note.
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:54.440]   I want to thank you so much, Mike Elgin, for being here.
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:41:00.000]   Even though you're in the dark, the lights are off, the furnace is off, there's no food
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000]   on the table.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:02.000]   I'm so sorry.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.680]   No, everybody should go to Elgin.com.
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:08.880]   You subscribe to Mike's list.
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:11.080]   Are you still doing the Google Photos?
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.040]   Mike's nice book or is that...
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:14.040]   Nice book.
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:20.680]   I'm probably going to be moving it somewhere just out of a kind of protest.
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:25.360]   I'll figure that out and announce whatever it is I'm doing because it has a few thousand
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:29.320]   people who follow that pretty regularly.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:36.840]   But I would also like to let people know that this pandemic will end and we will travel
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.840]   again.
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:43.240]   Our first one is going to be Provence this summer, Gaster Nomad Experience, followed by
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:45.480]   Prosecco and Barcelona and Vahaka.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:50.920]   You say something about Vahaka because we just spent a long time in Vahaka.
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:57.400]   And Vahaka, you can't book anything for Day of the Dead in Vahaka.
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.160]   That's like Rio for Carnival, right?
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:05.680]   It's the epicenter of Day of the Dead celebration.
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:08.200]   And we booked the very best place to live.
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:13.320]   We booked the city's top chef to give a personal cooking class.
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:19.120]   We are going to have the most amazing Day of the Dead ceremony in October of next year.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:24.280]   So if you want to do Vahaka, this is the way to do Vahaka.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.560]   But I would encourage everybody to sign up because travel is coming.
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:29.560]   It's coming back.
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:32.200]   We're going to have a vaccine and we are going to travel.
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:36.400]   We also kind of specializing these days, Leo, in pandemic safe travel.
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:43.000]   So we've actually developed this thing called the Safe Travels Manifesto, which is what I
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.320]   hope everybody will embrace this.
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.920]   And it's basically a long list of things, not that long, but it's a list of things to
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:58.440]   do about how to fly, how to go to restaurants, how to go to hotels and airbnbs, how to travel
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.680]   without spreading the pandemic and without getting a virus.
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:05.480]   And so we're hoping everybody will embrace that.
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:06.480]   Wonderful.
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:07.480]   Gastronomad.net.
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:12.480]   It is my dream someday to go on.
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:13.480]   Yes.
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.720]   And you know what, Vahaka, next Halloween sounds pretty darn awesome.
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:18.720]   It's so amazing.
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:20.600]   I would love to do that.
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:25.040]   Owen J. J. Stone, not related to the guy who owns nine terabytes of photos on Google
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:26.040]   Photos.
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:27.040]   He's not the same guy.
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:29.160]   That's just somebody with the same name.
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:30.560]   But different guy, different guy.
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.240]   I got to turn the lights off.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.640]   You see my name.
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:44.320]   If you work for Google, you'll find him at iqmz.com, inquiring minds media.
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:46.240]   Let me tell you something, Uncle Leo.
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:47.240]   Yes.
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:48.240]   You got to always end the show.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.880]   You know you're going to end the show.
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:55.040]   So first and foremost, I've been stressed out this year.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:56.280]   I've been semi depressed.
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:58.080]   I've been not happy.
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.080]   I know that.
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:00.080]   No, it's not.
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:01.080]   We love you, Owen.
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:02.080]   We love you.
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:03.320]   It's not that everybody's been this way.
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:04.320]   This year there's a rough.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.640]   I'm just saying, I know if I'm upset, I know other people loves it.
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:09.640]   It's true.
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:12.240]   If you get to me, you've gotten to everybody.
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:14.000]   But the end of the year is coming.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.120]   The holidays are here.
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:19.320]   Don't look at the whole quarantine thing as a bad thing.
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:23.160]   So many times in your life, you've been too busy to spend time with your family or your
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:25.520]   loved ones or call and check on people.
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:27.680]   Right now, you have nothing else to do.
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:30.280]   Call that friend you haven't talked to in a long time.
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:32.480]   Send those text messages out.
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:36.480]   Make sure that you reach out and touch the people beyond social media that matters somewhat
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.640]   in your life that you miss sometimes because right now, they might need that phone call
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:41.640]   from you.
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:43.000]   They might need a message from you.
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.280]   And if you're home and you're stuck with your kids, I just order myself up.
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:50.040]   Hello, chatterbox for my daughter.
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:51.040]   >> Good.
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:55.120]   >> I also have her running on code kingdoms because I still do believe in coding.
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:56.720]   So get one of those two things.
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.160]   There's not both of them for your kids.
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:01.600]   Get them educated for the future, not just because you're homeschooling.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:04.040]   You might as well homeschooling for something that they might need to know.
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.840]   You're teaching about some taxes or some banking and stuff like that.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:12.000]   But spend this quality time together doing stuff that makes you happy and create new
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000]   traditions.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.000]   I didn't have a turkey this year.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.560]   I made a meatloaf turkey.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:16.560]   It was delicious.
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:19.040]   We might forgo turkeys for the rest of existence.
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:20.040]   I don't know.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:21.400]   So look inside yourself.
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.160]   I know it's been down, but we on the way up because it's holiday season for the smile
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.160]   on your face.
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:30.080]   Do something that makes you happy for you because that's all that we can do.
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.080]   I love you guys.
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:32.080]   I appreciate being on the show.
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:35.520]   Thank you so much for having me on Gileo and happy birthday.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:37.680]   >> Another treat.
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:39.880]   You said this is in the camp.
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:49.880]   [MUSIC]
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:51.040]   it.
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:53.620]   (gentle music)
