[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend Tech, episode 29 for November 6, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And those of you who are watching on video saw me go, "Huh?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   But see on audio you can't tell, I'm used to doing radio and nobody knows I'm going.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Well the best part though is when you do your radio voice, you're like, "This is Twit!"
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I have to do it like that, otherwise people don't know.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Oh you need a little radio tower noise in the background.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   [Music]
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Roger Chang.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Hello.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   GameSpot.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Yes, a fine company.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   How are you doing these days? You're doing a lot of video on GameSpot.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Oh yeah, a lot more than that.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The more than that I could have ever imagined when they originally told me about the job.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   He's the Tech TV Xerox Park guy number one.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Xerox Park guy number two.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He is Patrick Norton from Digital Life TV at Ziff Davis.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   That's gone really good.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So far so good.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   10 terabytes last week.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Actually, he was a little bit more than that.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Wow.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   That doesn't actually, because you gotta remember me and math would like this.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'm starting to get a real appreciation for bandwidth.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Actually, what you're starting to get to appreciate this is the cost of bandwidth in very large volume.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   [Laughs]
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Well, I'll introduce the rest of the twist and we'll talk about that.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   There's actually a lot to talk about.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's a very busy week.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   David Prager is also here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   He's the representative of System.org this week.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   System.org in revision two.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Because Kevin, you're like, "Hello!"
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Look at the camera.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Which one?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   There's three.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Can't keep mentioning cameras.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Look at the audio people get upset.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You're spending money on cameras.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   David is here in lieu of Kevin Rose who will never be here again.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He's actually worked out a schedule.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I think he's gonna be here.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He's gonna be here.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   He's gonna schedule with all his travel plans.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   He's gonna Tennessee's, going to Japan.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Does he have an assistant now?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We talked him into going, he might be going to the Portal Media Expo next weekend.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, really?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Might be.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Please talk him into that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm trying to get him to do that.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Everyone is an admin now.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We're doing Twitch from the Portal Media Expo or Podcast Expo at three o'clock in the hall.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And they tell me if you just say, "I'm here to see Twitch that'll let you in for free."
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So say you're here to see Twitch.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And Alex Albrecht's going to join us.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   As soon as I--
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   As soon as I heard that Kevin might go, I talked to the guy in charge.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I think his name's Tim and I asked him, "Hey, can I get Kevin Rose and he does this?"
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And he said, "Oh, you know, just make him have him register when he shows up."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's 25 bucks.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Come on.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They're gonna afford it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.560]   From Pixelcore, the great Alex Lindsey, who is a regular now on call for help, he comes
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.120]   up every week, every month to Toronto.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   It's his offices we're in.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   Something like that.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.480]   We're here because his offices are draped in black.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   We like black.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   It's very fun.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   It's very fun.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   The Pixelcore crew are doing all the video and putting us together.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   They're great.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   We could not do this without them and they do it all.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   They're all volunteers.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Well, we could do it.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   It would just look awful.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   It would be the same.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   It wouldn't be the same.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.560]   And it saved me quite a few late nights.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   I have to say, I'm really happy about that.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.040]   So thank you, Pixelcore.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.840]   Big story of the week.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.240]   It's just making me hop and mad.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.400]   We covered it on security now with Steve Gibson in detail.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   I actually did an early security now because it was such a big story.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   It first came to light last month, but nobody paid much attention to it.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.400]   The F-Secure people said, "Sony is putting a rootkit on Windows systems when you run
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Sony BMG audio CDs."
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.320]   Hey, hey, nobody paid any attention until the fellow from Sysinternals, who makes a rootkit
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   reviewer program called RootkitRevealer, mentioned it in his blog and the world came
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   tumbling down.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.520]   That was earlier this week.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   So here's the deal.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   If you have a Sony BMG disc, they've been doing this since last spring that says content
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.360]   enhanced and protected copy.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.440]   How many titles or how many albums really?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   You know, it's not clear.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   Nobody's ever said.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   Sony's not saying.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.360]   So I stopped buying CDs two years ago.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.680]   But if you look at it, you'll know because the CD will say content enhanced.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.840]   If you play it on a Windows machine, you'll get a Yule.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   You'll get a license agreement that pops up and says, "Is it okay to install some software?"
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   It mis-describes the software, including it implies that you can remove it easily or
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   disable it easily.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   And so most people are just saying, "Yeah, okay, I just want to listen to my music."
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.400]   What it's installing is effectively a rootkit, which a rootkit, of course, is a hacker tool
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   that allows software to hide on your computer files, to hide on your computer hides so well,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.080]   because by patching the kernel that no program, not even the operating system, can see these
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   files.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   They're just invisible.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.520]   In fact, the way that Sysinternals RootkitRevealer does it is by actually writing its own operating
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   system code and comparing what it gets with a directory listing to what the operating system
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   is saying.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.720]   And if there's a discrepancy, if rootkit revealer is finding files that the operating system
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   doesn't know about, it says, "You've got a rootkit."
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.280]   But you don't need toâ€”you can install that for the fact you don't need to immunize.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.960]   The Sysinternals Rootkit revealer is great.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.560]   There's also one called Blacklight from FSecure.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.680]   They basically both work the same way.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.480]   But Mark Recinovich, who's at Sysinternals, was the guy on Monday who said, "This one,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.120]   there's this Sony Rootkit on here."
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.960]   So is this because Sony decided to license a protection, like some kind of DRM?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   From an ex-British company.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.520]   Were they naive in the company that made this DRM technology?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.880]   No, but did the company that made the DRM technology decide, "Hey, let's put this on
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.400]   here and make it really sloppily?"
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.320]   And Sony just said, "Okay, this is probably good stuff we'll put on."
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.800]   You've got two basic options.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.960]   Either Sony went, "Wow, this looks like an incredibly robust system for protecting our
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.480]   content, preserving our revenue stream."
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.160]   Or Sony knew exactly what it was doing and was like, "Yeah, I choose the latter."
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.520]   As someone who used to work for Sony, a long time ago.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   Evil!
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520]   Evil!
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   Hey, I left.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520]   I left.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   Okay.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   Over a decade ago.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   Before the BMG thing.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   Before the BMG thing.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.320]   But I wasn't there.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.560]   I wasn't part of the decision-maker.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.920]   But I would actually suggest that they may not haveâ€”
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   They didn't know it.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   There's a lot of decisions.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.840]   There's a lot of decisions that they make that some executiveâ€”
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.080]   Nobody sat down with the executive and said, "We're going to use a root kit."
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   And the executiveâ€”
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   No, no, no.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   Yeah, the executive doesn't know how to check his email.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   Great.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   What's a root kit?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.680]   All they said in the executive is, "No, don't worry.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   No one will know it's there.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.920]   No one will be able to see it.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.360]   It hides itself."
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.160]   In fact, it was possible to remove it and they patched it just a few months ago to prevent
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.360]   removal.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   So what I think Sony is culpable for is that much.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   Somebody said to them, "Oh, yeah, you cannot install it."
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.680]   And they said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't want that to happen."
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.160]   Now this thing is so badly written that it scans your disk like eight times a minute.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   It does.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.880]   It double scans it, but worse.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.440]   And I think the real serious thing is it means that any file that begins with dollar sign,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.840]   S-Y-S dollar sign, any file will disappear, is immediately root-root-kitted.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.280]   So I, in fact, Mark Risenovich, who discovered this took notepad.exe and renamed it to dollar
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   sign, S-S dollar sign, notepad.exe.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.280]   And it disappeared.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.920]   It could have quit third party hacker could just take advantage of knowing that they could
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   hide stuff like that.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.960]   Funny you should mention that because there's a world of Warcraft hack that's been built
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.720]   around the root kit.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   Oh, really?
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   I know that.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.320]   So somebody's got a hack that they put on your system?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.960]   No, not an R-sit bid.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.640]   She used to cheat in the game.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   She used that to hide it essentially.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   And any idiot 12-year-old who knows enough to rename a file, dollar sign, S-S dollar sign
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.240]   can, in fact, put anything you want on your system.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   So not, I mean, Sony can say, well, look, you know, I mean, there's root kit technology
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.080]   used in Kaspersky antivirus in Norton.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.240]   The trash protect, they could say, look, this is legitimate, other companies use this,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.640]   but what they can't say is what really a problem is that they're opening this huge security
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.600]   hole on everyone in this system is installing.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.520]   And now here's the latest that just came out today from Markersonovich.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.680]   As we take this, it came out on Friday.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.720]   He said it's also phoning home.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   Every time you play a Sony disc, it's calling Sony and saying what songs you're listening
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   to.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.600]   See, there's marketing people at Sony's going, hey, this is, you know, we're trying
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   to figure out how many people are actually listening to our audio on computers, isn't
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   this great?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   You know?
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.880]   I think there's like this weird, like, mismatch because Sony started out as a hardware company
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.760]   and then they decided to get into the content business.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.200]   So it's kind of like, I think my impression is they got into the content business because
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.280]   they needed, they had, they lost on the hardware business because they didn't have enough content.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.600]   They got beta maxed ones and they were like, we're, we're always, we're going to be self-sufficient.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.080]   You know, you know, and that's the same way that Apple, you know, had trouble and now
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.160]   they have lots of their own software, you know, you know, and that's the, it's the same approach
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   in certain ways.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.200]   Really, if they knew what they were talking about, they would be even more culpable because
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.400]   this thing is so badly written and so appalling.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.160]   For instance, if you pull it out, if you do on it, if you manage to uninstall it, it breaks
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.320]   your CD, you can no longer see your CD, because it's patched.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.920]   This is just another good reason not to buy any more CDs.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   No more Sony CDs.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.520]   I certainly, if you're not the property, because your CD opens all the time, just randomly.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   It's going that way anyway.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.680]   Go into the Apple stores, not the best option because the audio quality isn't as high as
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   it could or should be.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   It isn't.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.720]   Well, I would certainly say stop playing CDs on your computer.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.280]   In fact, don't play DVDs on your computer, too, because there's a similar thing that
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.680]   happens with this interactional player.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.360]   There's a much better lesson here.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   Buy a Mac.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.280]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.200]   I mean, we don't know because there's no root kit revealer for the Mac.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.440]   I don't think it's actually possible.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.520]   Well, if you buy music from Sony that has this...
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   It's possible on any system.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.320]   In fact, the original root kits were designed for Unix systems.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   It is absolutely possible.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   All it is is back-action that's cool.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   I guess it's still asking the kernel.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.360]   It's still asking because Apple, every time it goes into that, it's going to, Apple's
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.080]   going to keep on asking you, are you sure you want to do this?
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.840]   But once you patch the kernel, all bets are off.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.240]   It doesn't matter because they can patch the kernel to stop asking you.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   They can do anything they want.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   But if you take any of these disks and just pop it in your system and have, say, iTunes,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.240]   you know, rip it, you're fine.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   Well, it was in the whole purpose of this to hide the CD.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.880]   This is to keep it from being ripped.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   I mean, now I don't know if this works on these.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   There you have.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   And that extends the CDs.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   It's not a digital.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   It's an analog thing.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   And by the way, they're trying to plug the analog.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.120]   We're going to get to that in a little bit, too.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.720]   That's a huge story.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.560]   This is a bad week for civil libertarians.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.040]   It's a bad week for American citizens.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   I agree.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.760]   Well, I respect their rights or not.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   I agree.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.480]   So in the past, remember holding down a shift key would prevent this software from running
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   because it prevents auto runs.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.080]   So if you want to listen to a content-enhanced CD, hold the shift key down.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   I still wouldn't put it on my computer.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.000]   And I presume if you say no to the EULA, the license agreement, nothing will happen.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   We can only hope.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's just a problem.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.760]   We'll probably just spit your CD back out.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   There is a patch.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.640]   Sony, the company that wrote this, XPC Aurora, is offering a service pack one for the company.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.040]   Because they found a better way to hide it.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.840]   Well, hey, we'll take that one out.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.120]   I don't trust them, but they say it makes it so that you can remove it.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   It's 3.5 megabytes.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   It's a huge download.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.840]   A service pack for a root kit?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   A service pack.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   That sounds dangerous.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   That's awesome.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.560]   We'll put links to Mark Risenvich's blog postings because that was really the most complete
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.200]   and I urged people also to listen to security now because Steve and I talked about it quite
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   a bit.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.520]   Somebody else went out and went to a record store with a list of the names of the CDs
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.040]   that had this on them.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.200]   I was like, "I understand there's supposed to be a EULA I can read according to Sony's
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   website."
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   Which there is.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.040]   And then people in the store are like, "Huh?"
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.200]   It's not printed on the label.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   So I hope there are serious repercussions for Sony for this because this is just bad
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   corporate behavior.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.640]   I'm not picking the PS3 up next to you.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   Okay.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   That's...
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   No, well, I certainly wouldn't buy any more Sony music.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   I've been thinking about selling my Sony PSP because there's no games worth playing on
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   it.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   Somebody will write another game for a while.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   You know why?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   It's a movie player.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.600]   Well, you're asking developers to create games for the PSP right as the Xbox 360 comes
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.960]   up and right as the PS3 comes around the corner?
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.800]   PS3 is not around the corner.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.200]   No, but the development kits are out there and they are coding.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   So you're asking companies with limited resources.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.880]   So I can either kind of report and rehash a PS2 game over to the PSP or I can actually
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.720]   devote the time and money to something that I actually sell.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   So...
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.960]   I mean, most of the instant the PSP has been selling very poorly compared to it.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.880]   So nobody's developing for the PSP?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   No, there are games.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   I know there are games, but...
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.760]   There are games coming out, but everyone's attention, in my opinion, seems to be kind
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.400]   of taken by the next generation.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   It's a great disappointment to me.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.160]   I mean, I bought a PSP and I was looking for it.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   It's a good gaming platform.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.640]   It's a nice piece of hardware.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   It's brilliant with it.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.360]   I have one too and if you really, really want more gaming, get a DS.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.200]   I bought one and when I first picked one...
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   And then it turned out everybody's going...
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   I thought it was...
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   I was kind of like, "Jesus, kind of big plastic piece of you know what?"
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   You know what?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   It's actually cool.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   The games are fun.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   You do the two...
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.040]   You're doing this finger and then...
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   It's awesome.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.160]   It's like you would think it's like the most...
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.680]   When you first hear about everyone's calling the next virtual boy, the next failure.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.080]   And here it is.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.680]   It's selling more games, more titled, rolling down.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.000]   I have some vision of you with Nintendogs.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.880]   Actually, I don't have Nintendogs.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   I do have...
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   Oh, what's the...
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.480]   She actually has to know this because I edited the review for this.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.640]   But it's a surgery game.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   It's where you basically...
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640]   My cooperation.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   Kind of.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   You do little sutures and stuff on the skin is probably...
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   It's actually pretty fun.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.320]   And then there's Ace Right...
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.720]   See, that's the problem with the Nintendo DS.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   It's a kid though.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   You know what?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   I know a lot of adults with them.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.400]   I've yet to see a child with one in their hands.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   You might get them wrong.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.760]   I mean, there's a lot of really cool...
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.240]   I mean, there's electroplankton, which some will debate as whether or not it's a real...
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   Electroplankton?
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Yes.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   Is your job to use...
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.280]   It's a musical game where you actually create music hitting...
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.840]   You don't use your baling to sieve through the krill and try to find food stuff.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   Yeah, but krill is...
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.000]   I don't think krill is kind of just plankton, even so of plankton.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   This is why...
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.600]   This is why I love Roger.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.040]   It's going to be a lot of unique games because of the fact that they've got this weird...
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   It's fun.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   ...and they're going to do it with the revolution.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   You know what?
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.880]   It's cheap and the games are a lot cheaper than the $50 PS.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   Was it EA?
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.680]   Who was it that said that the revolution controller is going to spawn a slew of crappy
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   games?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   I think it was EA that said this.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   I think they have a lot of interesting games.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   Where they just jump.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   They have a lot of...
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   They have a lot invested in certain...
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   I think what I think it's so...
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   I should say anything.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:10.120]   What I think is so frustrating about the PSP is how hard they've made it because they
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.160]   want to sell movies to the PSP.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.360]   How hard they make it to put content on it.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   They have Wi-Fi.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.280]   That's what this doesn't have.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.760]   My iPod video doesn't have...
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.560]   Does your iPod really need Wi-Fi?
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.920]   Oh yeah, because then you could download...
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   You could watch two...
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   We could download content and you can one-six the speed of...
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.720]   What I'm more interested in is that I could...
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.800]   I chat people and I would use my phone about half of what I use it for.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.080]   Why am I the only person who doesn't see Wi-Fi everywhere in North America?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.800]   Somebody was in my computer like you've got to do a story on the Wi-Fi phones that are
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   coming out.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.880]   They're going to bury, bury wireless.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.600]   And it's like, where?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   I live in San Francisco.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.000]   It's supposed to be the most wired city in the country after Seattle.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.560]   You couldn't even get on in here where there's Wi-Fi flying for each.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   I got...
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   We're all online.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.960]   I think Nintendo is actually doing a deal with McDonald's to have...
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   Hold on.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   You could play...
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   You could play...
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   You could play a Wi-Fi and get a DS.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   In McDonald's.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   Play Nintendo's.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Eat fries.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   Actually, it's funny because it's way poor in the States.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.080]   It's way poor at McDonald's in the States and it's fat poor in Canada and they're doing
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.480]   a deal with fat poor Nintendo is to also...
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.040]   Fat poor is a hot spot provided on Canada.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.320]   I don't know if you can get a happy meal kind of deal with it.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   That'd be kind of cool.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.560]   All right, game time's over.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   Let's talk about the broadcast flag and the analog hole.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.080]   Actually, before you were starting to say about the Wi-Fi or...
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   Well, it's just that there's so much that you could do with Wi-Fi.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   I mean, being able to get content, get like news or get something, you know, get live
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.440]   footage or just be able to buy movies while I'm sitting around.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.560]   I don't have to write, you know, I don't have to go somewhere.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.680]   I can just sit there and pay my $199.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.760]   Sony could be doing what Apple's doing with the iTunes Music Store if they created something
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.240]   that I don't even have to load.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   Sony does...
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.800]   Sony, if you go to connect.com, they've got exclusive content for the PSP.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.880]   Don't you think there's a root kit on your PSP?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.400]   None of our viewers... most of our viewers should go to connect.com because they're probably
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   using Firefox and connect.com doesn't...
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   It only works with IE 5.5 and...
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.600]   Ooh, I don't want to go anywhere.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   I don't want to go to a website.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.000]   I want to just be sitting there on my...
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Right.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I really want this.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.640]   Why max would be great if Wi-max would actually be, you know, Wi-max, most of all
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   have the...
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   In a usable manner?
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.520]   Well, there is a patch, a hack patch for the PSP that will be out soon that will override
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   all of those firmware fixes that Sony's put out to turn off piracy.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.240]   It's amazing that they will allow you to play DIVX and X-Fit and all the other...
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.160]   There are must controls of platform Alex via Sony.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   But you know, it's interesting...
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.720]   And you'll hold that all the way to the bottom of the scene.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.360]   It's interesting because the PSP is geek porn.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.720]   People want it so badly that they're going to hack this sucker and it doesn't matter what
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   Sony does.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.520]   It just shows you what a losing proposition it is.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   It's a GP32.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.160]   What's that?
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   It's actually a...
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.280]   The thing in South Korea is that they're so nationalistic and they're so kind of...
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.320]   They have a certain issue with Japan.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   So they block a lot of Japanese imports including video game consoles.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   Oh really?
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.680]   So it's one of the few places in Asia where you see a lot of PC gaming.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.000]   You can't because you can't get a Nintendo in or a Sony.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   You can't.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   You know, you have to import it.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.920]   Just, you know, go to the import and get a very high price.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.160]   But also because they have a lot of broadband.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.480]   We're going to import Black Market, PSPs into Korea.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.720]   Well, there's a company that actually makes...
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.280]   It's basically a handheld video game unit but it's completely open source.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.080]   They give you the SDKs for it.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   That's the GP32.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.880]   And you...
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.680]   Basically there's this entire cottage, you know, kind of hacker but development group
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:43.000]   made of open source users who created emulator's own games, you know, moving, watching utilities
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and P3 players.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   I think it's Korea.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Stuff.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   So you know, excuse me, you must either late this year or next year.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   Walmart's going to have it.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.360]   Walmart's going to sell the rocker for 87 bucks.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.480]   Walmart's going to make millions.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   How much?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   The rocker, the razor.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   The razor.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.480]   How much money is...
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   How much...
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   Remember what's the...
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   What's the deal with the new...
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   The current rule is for about 200 bucks.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   Because like...
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   The motor will make 5 cents.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   It's 200 bucks on it.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.160]   If you buy 200 million of anything, you can get it for half.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.920]   But that was like, I remember all the funds.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   They're not that expensive to make it.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.960]   Because there's companies that say they ensure you can ensure your cell phone and the deductible.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   Apparently the deductible...
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.320]   No, the deductible has been more money than the cell phone value is if the replacement
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   phone they give you, you hear about that?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   Well, I'm not buying that insurance.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.960]   There's some class action lawsuit going on.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   That's not good insurance.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   I don't know if that...
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.120]   The cell phone costs are really strange because it's hard to...
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.520]   That's why it's cool to see some of the sites where they actually give you a total of the
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.880]   value of the parts inside a cell phone or a...
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   It's all subsidized though, right?
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   I mean, it doesn't really matter what it costs.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.520]   Well, it's hard to tell, right?
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.520]   Because if you buy one outright, it's like $500.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.880]   And if you buy one of the two-year contracts, it's $250.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.400]   And if it's a Wednesday under a full moon, there's $75 off on top of that.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.480]   What's your best friends with the guy who runs those cell phones?
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.120]   That's when somebody's like, "Well, I'm getting the new," and they inserted the name
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.600]   of this $700 PDA cell phone.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.440]   I'm like, "You're 15.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.040]   You don't have a calendar to organize.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   Why do you need this seven-hour cell phone?"
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   And he's like, "Well, I can get it for 50 bucks."
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   I'm like, "How?"
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   I'm always like, "His buddy works at the cell phone store."
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   Are you saying that basically these cell phones are a lot cheaper than their...
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   I don't know.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.040]   I'm curious.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   Your shirt left the factory at $1.50.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.320]   I mean, you know what's amazing?
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.960]   I think he paid the $1.99.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   Why?
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   Actually, there was only anything because it was a gift.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.400]   I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   So you know what?
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.760]   Just go tell my mother, she wasted money then.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.240]   That's horrible.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.480]   Mr. Rogers is on the phone.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   He wants his shirt.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.560]   This is from my friend who's about 6'4", so it's just small for him.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   It's the same thing.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.720]   I mean, we had just these incredibly absorbent prices.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.880]   There's lots of margin, and that's what makes it all work.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.400]   Margarine.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   The house...
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.600]   Did you know that there was a house subcommittee on courts, the internet, and intellectual
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   property?
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   Absolutely.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   The S...
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   Great reading.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   H-S-C-I-I-P.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   Sh*t.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   This...
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   But why the courts, the internet, and intellectual property?
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.760]   I mean, what do those do?
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   What do those do with each other?
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.320]   The RIAA, the MPA, rewriting federal law about the MVA, the small group of people who
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.600]   was close to New York City.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.440]   Hearings are going on right now in front of this subcommittee debating...
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   There's actually three laws.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.080]   One Corey talked about, for Dr. Rowan, when he was here a little while ago, to revive
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   the broadcast flag.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.520]   He couldn't get the FCC to do it.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, we must protect the content developers.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.920]   So the broadcast flag prevents copying on...
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.040]   Basically means every digital device that can play digital video has copy protection.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.360]   There's like analog hole, right?
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   That's my personal favorite.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   There's an analog hole.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.440]   It turns out if you have an analog device, who's stopping you from copying?
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:55.560]   So what they want is all analog devices like VCRs to start recording digitally and then
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.360]   put copy restrictions on.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   Okay.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.320]   I mean, isn't that one of the reasons why they were pushing so hard for H-E content
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.240]   because the belief was, if you make the bandwidth of the content so incredibly huge, no one
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.880]   in their right mind or this size short of a million dollars, you're going to be able
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.040]   to actually copy or do anything other than that.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   They were wrong about that.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.520]   They didn't know about BitTorrent.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   Dang, Lickman.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.920]   Dang, Lickman is the CEO of the MPAA following in the footsteps of the late great Jack
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   Bellenny.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.600]   It was not dead yet.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   No.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   Former.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.160]   Neither dead nor far from our hearts.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.600]   Lickman characterized the broadcast flag as necessary to, quote, "keep the free marketplace
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.400]   from turning into a black marketplace."
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.080]   And there were stuns on the table.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.000]   And the lovely Rick Bouchar responded that he thought the MPAA's proposals were unduly
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   restrictive.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.720]   Oh, say that again?
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   Unduly restrictive.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   Who said that?
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   Rick Bouchar, believe it or not?
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   Oh, Rick.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   Yeah, he's coming around.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.240]   Zolafgren, who is from Silicon Valley, she's a Democrat from California, said, "Congress
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.560]   should do it at hand to keep content owners from being ripped off, but not at the end
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.440]   of the expensive limiting consumers' rights or killing off technological development."
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.840]   Which is something the RIA and the MPAA are working furiously.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.560]   They don't care about.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.360]   So I don't know what the status is of these, but clearly this is one where you should go
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   to action.ef.org.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   I'm personally rooting for it.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   Aren't you?
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   And why would that be?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.280]   Because the more they screw up, the more they screw up, they just keep on pushing that thing
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   down.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.280]   Look what Sony's done.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.160]   So if they basically make pirates out of a whole generation, what we'll do is we'll
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.480]   make everybody break the law.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.440]   So we will have no regard for it anyway.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.760]   So out of that, or we'll tighten it so much that we open up a huge chasm for other content.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.720]   Because we're going to hang on to it.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.520]   You can't touch it and you can't have it unless you pay us every time you think about
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.360]   our content.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.080]   And the thing is, if they keep on going down that path, they really are going to open up
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.800]   a whole horde of other content that will run them over.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   It is a typical...
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   So you're...
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:11.400]   It's like the people who vote for the other guys in the election hoping the whole system
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.880]   will come tumbling down.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   I don't know.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   I'm just a Mark Hawkman.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.800]   I know very little facetious I have to say.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   I think it's a bad idea.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   It was Alex.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   I vote yes.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.200]   Mark Hawkman over at Xtreme DRM wrote a bunch of articles about this and got a little more
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.480]   technical than other people.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.240]   Anyone who reads some stuff or somebody's just utterly dismayed and pissed off about
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   what's going on.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   I mean, I understand...
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.600]   Part of me understands, people want to get paid for content.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.480]   But rather than exploring ways of doing that, micro payments, content tracking, better
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.480]   distribution systems, better quality on distribution, it's always about locking it down and more
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.680]   importantly having a legal recourse.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:55.080]   And the other thing is the digital money and copyright act is strange at best.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.240]   Well, here's an example of this Mark Risenovich in order to figure out what the Sony DRM was
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   doing.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   The other thing on this rootkit had to violate the DMCA because he had to reverse engineer
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   the rootkit.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   Right.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.080]   So in order to protect us, you had to break the law.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   But it's everywhere.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.280]   And the other thing is a lot of companies were citing...
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.520]   Remember when the DMCA first came out, companies were citing left and right.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.320]   We're going to sue you onto the DMCA.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.800]   And it's like, there was no digital...
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   There's no copy protection on this.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.480]   How can you cite the DMCA?
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.320]   It's a big scary four-letter word.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.680]   It's like, right, it works.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   But your letter at least.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.840]   Yeah, that's always that, you know...
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   Collapse.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.840]   Well, they've had cases.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.640]   I mean, people are starting to get nailed for downloading movies through BitTorrent.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   Oh man.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.920]   Has anybody here read Penny Arcade on a regular basis?
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   Pennyarcade.com?
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.800]   I read it whenever I come here because you don't rank it out to you.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   What's the latest?
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.960]   No, no, I just wanted to say that Penny Arcade rules, that's a little spam.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.280]   They did some pretty good stuff when...
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   They do get naughty.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   So if you're under 18 ask your parents to check it out for you.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   Let's do a little plug thing.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Because, you know, I think this is good.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   We do a little plug thing.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   Frederator.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   You know, Frederator is?
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.200]   Not the old Frederator on TV where it used to sell.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   No, no, no.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.160]   Frederator is a company that does cartoons for Cartoon Network and others.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   They do some pretty cool cartoons.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.920]   They're putting free cartoons on iTunes as part of the iTunes video.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.280]   So they just sent me a note.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.160]   They're big fans of Twitter and they said, "Would you plug the fact that we're putting
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   up?"
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.200]   And I think this is one of the exciting things about having a distribution channel.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.600]   It is not the cable companies.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.600]   It's not the networks.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.200]   If you are an independent filmmaker or a short filmmaker or you have cartoons that Cartoon
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.720]   Network didn't want, suddenly you've done that one.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   They're not charging.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   They're going to give them away.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.200]   But I'm sure they hope like we do that they can charge.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   So there's my plug.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.720]   Anybody else have any other plugs you want to?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   Userfriendly.R.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   Can I bank plugs?
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   Userfriendly is very...
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Bank of plug to the next step.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Yeah, bank of plug.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.920]   You'll get two next time, David Preger.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   You did...
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:03.040]   I've found out about Frapper on Digital Life TV because you guys did a Frapper Mapper.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.200]   And we did our Twit Frapper.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.040]   Actually, I set it up on Friday and I think we've already broken Frapper.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   Because it doesn't...
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   It doesn't deal with...
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.840]   It's trying to load 1500...
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   And this is...
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.240]   I think it's probably an issue with the Google Maps API.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.320]   It wasn't really designed to track 2,500.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.360]   What Frapper is is an interface to Google Maps.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   And you can put in your zip code or your city and it will put a push pin on the map.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   And so you did it with DLTV and asking viewers to put push pins in and it just filled the
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   map.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.280]   And I just did it with Twit.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.240]   And yeah, you can't really load it.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.880]   It'll do 100, right?
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   And then you can do a 100.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.480]   Show all of them and then things slow down.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   But go to frat...
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.600]   Go to F-R-A-P-P-R dot com slash Twit.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.800]   And at least you can add it with that.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   That doesn't slow down.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   No.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   And then we'll just see how many buttons.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.600]   20,000 push pins.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   That's a scary thought.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.840]   I bet we will.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   We've got...
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.080]   It's funny because it's been growing but we were looking at the log files the other day.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.040]   And we've got people downloading DLTV in 124 countries.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   Isn't that neat?
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   Well, that's what I want to find out.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   It's called the One in Tunisia.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   My personal favorite is great.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.720]   We don't have anybody in Africa yet on Frapper anyway.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.160]   But we've got quite a few in Europe, Asia, Australia.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.960]   There'll be a whole bunch.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.920]   In a few days.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   Alright.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   This is fun.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.920]   I think it's...
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.920]   Proplug, F-R-A-P-P-R.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.880]   If you're listening to us in Bhutan, please make sure that it goes to Frapper.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.720]   Well, I really want somebody in Antarctica and South Dakota.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.000]   They'll seem to be the two most difficult to get.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.440]   And you would see Yahoo's new map.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.200]   Well, that's a good segue.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   What do you think?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   I like it.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.520]   This is not even a feature but the thing that I like about the Google Maps so much that
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.800]   I use all the time is the fact that you can do a hybrid view.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.880]   So it shows a real satellite view.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.520]   And for some reason, there's features in the new Yahoo one that's really neat especially.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.840]   It'll show the area that you zoomed in on by a little grayed out area and then you can
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.920]   look in that and you can use the scroll bar to zoom in and zoom out.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   It's using Java.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   It's maps.yahoo.com/beta.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.160]   It's not the full one.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.560]   Somebody said they were using Flash and I was like, "What?"
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.440]   No, I think it's Java because as I remember when I first did it, it loaded a Java window.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.200]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   Java.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   But it's kind of cool.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   It's really, really, really similar.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.600]   It's Google because you can move around actively.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.720]   I did find that the browse by category actually works a little bit better than Google.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.320]   It's just a little easier to find to get to it.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   I love it.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.440]   I think the more these guys are at each other's throats trying to best each other, the better
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   for us.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   The better features everyone's going to see.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   Absolutely.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   It's a competition.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:45.720]   Do we know if is the Yahoo maps, is it going to be open source the same way?
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   I mean not open source.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.160]   Well, that's something Google did that was really smart.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.480]   There is a Yahoo developer network that says, "Build your own map."
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.520]   Yahoo maps API application gallery.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.480]   What they're doing is they're looking at what was worked for Google and they're saying,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   "Good, we can do that.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.360]   We can do that just as well as you can do that."
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.120]   I think it's great.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.920]   It means there's more jobs for gearheads.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.760]   It means there's more cool web services for us.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.840]   Microsoft clearly is feeling the breath, hot breath of Yahoo and Google.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.960]   Did you go to the big web services announcement?
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   No.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.080]   The poster is like a rock show that they -- what do they call this?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   It was in San Francisco.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.480]   Microsoft live!
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.760]   The idea is they're going to do web versions of Windows in office.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.120]   It's one of the questions of it.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.680]   It's so -- I don't understand really.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.920]   Are these Ajax?
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   Yes.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.440]   The idea is it's web services.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.160]   You can use your office online.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.240]   You can use Windows online.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.640]   Watch out, PeopleSoft.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   It's kind of -- Watch out, Google.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   Exactly.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.280]   It's going to be putting out a bunch of software for that.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.120]   I think Mergifoli was like it's Hail Storm 2.0.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   Oh, joy.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   Oh, yay.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.520]   You see that Microsoft has tried to appeal something to the Supreme Court about it.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.080]   Let's talk about the lowest thing in a second.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.040]   I want to finish this web services thing.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.400]   It's hard, though, if you think about it from Microsoft to do anything that people are
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.640]   going to jump up and down about.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.200]   No matter what Microsoft does, they're going to say, "Oh, yeah, that's Hail Storm 2.0.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   Oh, yeah, that's MSN 2.0."
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   Because they've done everything.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.280]   They've also got a habit of doing the same thing and not working.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.920]   Then they change the name on it and they re-release it.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.640]   Is it time for them to pass the baton and say, "Look, I think they should just stick
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.880]   with what they do, applications, operating systems."
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.480]   Web services is a new generation.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   There's young people out there.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   You've got billions of dollars in the bank.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   The same thing.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.960]   The pocket PC5 or what's the latest handheld low?
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   It's actually pretty cool.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   You like it?
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:52.120]   I would probably buy one if I didn't have so many other toys to put in.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.400]   Windows Live and Office Live create opportunities for Microsoft to sell online subscriptions
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   and advertising.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.120]   There you go.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   Bottom line.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.920]   MS ads dollars.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.560]   They're going to have instant messaging programs.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.760]   They're going to compete with Skype and Vonage.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.280]   What do you know?
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.080]   You'll have email.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   It's kind of a little .Mac, a little MySpace.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.200]   We'll have real-time weather updates.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   Yes.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.160]   You don't have to worry about it until version three.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.040]   Then it takes over everything.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.880]   Until they tell everyone, you have to.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.680]   That's going to be the next piece of this.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.520]   What do you think people said though when Windows 1.0 came at?
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   Probably.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.360]   It's kind of funny when IE1 came out, when the first version IE came out, it wasn't too
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   bad.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.440]   It had issues, but it wasn't too bad.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.680]   By version three, it was like the classic.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   It was over for Netscape.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.480]   In fact, I'll never forget I did an editorial on the site on MSNBC saying that when an
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.640]   Internet Explorer 3 came out.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.560]   I said, "It starts shutting, turning off the lights in that escape because Microsoft's
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.200]   here and it's all over."
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.120]   Apparently, Mark and Driesin sought and just was furious.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.200]   He wouldn't talk to me for a long time after that.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   He was very...
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   He's just recently.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.400]   By the way, I was right.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   Netscape was sold to AOL just a year later.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.240]   The whole browser thing was the precursor to Microsoft's troubles with the DOJ.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Really?
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.960]   It was bundling the darn browser with the OS, which I think you should be able to do quite
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   honestly.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   It's part of the OS.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   Apple, does it?
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   Linux?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   Does it?
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Everybody does it, right?
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   Well, everybody did it after Microsoft.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   After Microsoft.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   So let's talk about this Eolus patent.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.200]   They tried to get the Supreme Court to review it.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.320]   The Supreme Court said, "No."
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.440]   So the trial goes on.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.560]   This is really a big deal, I think, because this is a patent...
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.960]   Another one of these companies formed to enforce a patent.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.160]   It's like the one click thing.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.800]   I need to put something that a plug-in in my browser so I can run flash things on it.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.160]   Well, essentially, it means that embedded objects on a webpage are patented.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.200]   Microsoft's unwilling to pay the royalties, the huge royalties that Eolus is asking, so
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.760]   they're going to have to change the way Internet Explorer works.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.360]   I guess all other browsers will, too.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.400]   What it means is it's just bad news for consumers, because it used to be, and still is right
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   now, seamless.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.840]   You go to a site that has some flash or a site that has some Java, just like Yahoo Maps.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.000]   It just loads and it doesn't.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.520]   Who is Eolus?
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.600]   I think they're a holding company.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   I don't know.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   We should find out.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.080]   It's a CEO problem.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   It was a...
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   See, Microsoft...
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Let's see.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.360]   It's a web browser called Volo, the V.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.000]   I.O.L.A. created by a computer program, an artist named Peewee or Peewee?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Okay.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.200]   They bought it, probably, right?
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.680]   Before the University of California filed for its patent, the University of California.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   Oh, that's right.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.840]   You see it involved in this.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   That's right.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   That's right.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.680]   And then they changed it to E.O.L.A.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.440]   Eolus, did they buy the rights to this or...
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.600]   They were granted a patent in November of 1998, which is not that long ago.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.720]   So, you see licensed this patent.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.040]   So, you see, I guess, it's involved in the lawsuit.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   But any event.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   This is bad news.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.480]   Microsoft has continually lost all along and the fact that the Supreme Court is not going
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.640]   to review it is bad news.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.920]   It means that either Microsoft will have to pay this company a lot of money and pay you
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.760]   see a lot of money or they're going to have to take out.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.920]   And they've already, by the way, they did this already.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.280]   And Apple also has figured out how to do this work.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.720]   It's an extra click, basically.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.160]   So it's just a pain, though.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.320]   You go to maps.yahoo.com/beta and instead of it just loading, you'll have to...
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.200]   It'll say, "Okay, in order for me to load this Java, you have to click a button."
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.120]   Well, I think the only thing that's happened is they wanted the Supreme Court to have a
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.040]   final decision on all it does now is go back to a district court.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   So, that's right.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   That's right.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   So, it's a trial move.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   So, it's a decision.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   It could end up going back to the...
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   It could go on forever.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   It could be appealed to the Supreme Court again.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   It could go on forever.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   That's right.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040]   And I think this is...
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   When someone's going to have to start really looking at it.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.440]   And the whole patent copyright, everything is just...
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   Everybody...
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   Have you seen the world?
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.440]   You've seen the world.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   You've had a story.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.440]   You've had a story.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.440]   You've had a story.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   Storyline, yeah.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   But did you see this plot?
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   It's a stupid plot, the one they patented.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   I don't know why it's that much.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.440]   The guy goes to...
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   The guy prays...
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   Two guys walk into a bar.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.440]   No, the guy applies to MIT.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   That's a great patent.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.920]   And he says, "I won't wake up until I get in."
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   Right?
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   To MIT.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   And 30 years later, he still...
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   He wakes...
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   It's according to the abstract of his 14-page application, a process of relaying a story
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.800]   having a timeline and a unique plot involving characters comprises Cole and indicating a
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.160]   character's desire at first time in the timeline for at least one of the following.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.480]   A, to remain asleep or unconscious until a particular event occurs.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   I'd like to remain unconscious.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   And B, to forget.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.480]   So, stop reading this.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   So, this is a great deal.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.560]   Can I patent the upside down pyramid and then go sue the New York Times and the Wall Street
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   Journal and the LA?
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.040]   Well, that's the problem with these patents.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.040]   It's supposedly prior art.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   I don't know.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   I could copyright it.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.040]   And then it's...
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.360]   Supposedly, prior art is supposed to overturn these things.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.160]   But, I mean, 1998, they patented embedded objects and web pages.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.000]   Don't you think there's prior art there?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.720]   Oh, well, maybe they will still win.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.000]   But right now, Microsoft owes the oldest $569 million.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.800]   Well, that's a Microsoft money that's played.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:26.160]   You'll get off of a million, take the patent and then go take over the web or something.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   Exactly.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   Google's going to hire a programmer to work, speaking of chicken feed to work from open
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   office to work on office.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.880]   Well, that's, I mean, it's interesting because apparently it was something said kind of off
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.160]   the cuff by one of our favorite.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.280]   We're holding them to it.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.360]   Was it Larry or...
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.360]   No.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.360]   They want us...
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   Who?
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   Somebody we know?
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   Oh, it was Chris Dibona.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   Yeah, I just...
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   I forgot it was Chris Dibona.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.080]   We got to get Chris on the show.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.520]   Chris was a regular on the screen saver.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   He's our Linux guy.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.600]   He's now in charge of open source software for Google.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.200]   He's your for open source programs.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.500]   Yeah, and he...
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   And I...
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   Good for Chris.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   He's got a little...
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   Got a little...
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   You're Larry and Sergey, a little free up a little back sheet.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.500]   Why am I talking to me?
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   He wanted to go make...
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   Start making video games.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.520]   He was working on a massively multiplayer online role playing game, but I think when
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.240]   World of Warcraft came out, he gave up.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.680]   You know, I finally erased that from my hard drive.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.320]   Was you a World of Warcraft?
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   I had to.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.920]   Because you were up until one o'clock, plus...
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   One.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.480]   Try three.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.760]   I mean, it's... and you get nothing done.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.120]   And you say, "But I've got to get the level 19."
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.920]   But did you raise your character's level?
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.400]   Oh yeah, well that's what you're doing.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   You know, you're...
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   They call it grinding it out.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   Is it...
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Did they just create a...
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   Excuse me.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.560]   A new world so people would have something to do once they...
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.720]   There's a expansion pack, because you know, you stop at level 60, and there's all these
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.040]   level 60s wandering around.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.280]   It's kind of creepy too, because these guys are so powerful.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   They're like, "God, I mean, my God."
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.120]   He's just like, "Touch people to disappear."
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   It's dying.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.120]   That's right.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   So they finally have to do something with these guys.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.560]   So yeah, they've got a new expansion pack that lets you go beyond.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   Sounds like a plot line.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.120]   I think I patented that one.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.320]   I have to admit, I...
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   I...
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   You never play these?
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.760]   I don't put any games on my computer, not because I hate them, but because I love them.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   This thing is addictive.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.240]   And it's not even that fun.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   It's not even that fun.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.360]   Married and marginally functional as an adult, if you get...
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.520]   World of Warcraft and both of those tenuous situations.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   I was not.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   I was very far from...
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.520]   Well, very far from...
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   But it was just...
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.520]   My wife would kill me if she found me paying video games for like 12 hours.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.520]   What are you doing?
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.040]   Well, I would never play for 12 hours straight.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.760]   I would play for 12 hours in a 24-hour period.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.600]   So I'd play for a couple hours on, a couple hours.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.560]   Yeah, that sounds so much better when you put it that way.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.040]   You're like the fourth or fifth person I know has been like, "Yeah, I had to pull it off
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   my system."
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   It's bad, you know.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.720]   They're gonna have like, you know, like little treatment centers.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   Just another level, man.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.360]   First taste is always free.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   I am powerless.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   Oh, every eight months or those, there's some story.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   About some poor guy in like Japan who's at a cafe.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.920]   Korea actually is more often.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   Who dies.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   He played for 36 hours straight and stopped to go to the bathroom and he didn't make it
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   back.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   And he's in the last of the heart attack.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.320]   What just happened, didn't it?
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.560]   I've been like three or four of those stories, I think.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.520]   What's like, what's more depressing than like dying while playing EverQuest for 48
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520]   hours straight?
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.200]   Well, I mean, really, that's what finally did it for me was that I would...
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.800]   You were thinking about kidney failure?
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.120]   At the end of these six-hour sessions or whatever, I'd go, "What did I do?"
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   What have I done?
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.040]   I've just wasted six hours.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   I will never get back.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.360]   You've had glorious, six glorious hours of online gaming experience.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.080]   So were you like a wizard or an elf or a demi-dragon?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   Undead Priest.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   Oh, well.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   Well, I have a number.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   I have a gnome mage named Twit, by the way.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.920]   Come on, you say Undead Priest one more time.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.960]   The Undead Priest is named the tech guy.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.080]   But don't go looking for him because he's gone.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   He's gone.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.760]   I left it on one computer that I, you know, my laptop that I don't carry, you know, they
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   don't have around, just in case.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   But I've been jonesing.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.920]   It's been a tough week for me.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.840]   I have to say I'm working on the sweats.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.640]   You need to do habit.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   Well...
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.840]   Brother, can you spare a level?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.880]   I'll use your computer for 10 minutes.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.040]   They do that by the way.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.720]   You can pay people to level you up.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   There are like sweatshops.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   I know, I know.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   It's just bizarre.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:20.080]   It's a role of Central American kids under nourished impoverished play games.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.240]   They level up cringos up out of North.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   They do!
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240]   I think that's true.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.080]   I would actually, in fact, if anybody is a level up, does this for a profession or even
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:35.040]   for like spirit change, please call us, send us an email, Leo@thisweekintech.com.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.200]   We'll get you on the show because I would very, very...
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.000]   Actually, there's people who are basically running, I mean, little sweatshops doing this.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.800]   Oh, people are making money.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:50.880]   People make money by making leather hose and selling them on eBay with special enchanted
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.400]   powers.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.800]   Like for cash, for good for dogs.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   I understand.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   For real money.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   It's not like for...
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   It's a whole economy.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   I understand it.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   It's like...
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   It's nothing tangible.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   You work for GameSpot.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   What do you mean?
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   Don't you understand that?
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Hey, look, what do you get out of game?
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   Why do you get out of game?
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   How many billions of years do you know?
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   How many billions of years do you know?

[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   What about a solid U.S.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   What about a solid U.S.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   That's a good question.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   I bet you it wouldn't.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   It's probably Linux, so it probably wouldn't have to worry about it.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   So basically it's a dedicated lame box.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Lame as an NBA 3.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   It's a lot of money given what you're getting, but really I think it's for people either who don't have computers or don't want to put their computer in their living room, but want that functionality.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   Interesting.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   I think you're going to see more and more of this stuff.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   My lame box is my Pismo Mac.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   I have a 60 gig drive hooked up to my back.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   Well that's exactly what you're thinking about.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   I just kind of throw everything onto it.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   Yeah, that's what that's basically what a laptop does.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   But yeah, but for like my parents who want to just throw everything in there.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   It's very cool.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   You can also use the window for the car and you'd be really sick.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   Yeah, making you use the Windows Media Center.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   You could use some of the open source boxes that are out there.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   It's amazing how many sort of computer centric.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   Meteous devices that are starting to do.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   Most of these media's have sprung out from a PC in some fashion or another.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   Are we done?
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   I don't think we have.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   Oh, you want to talk?
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   Well, Amazon and Google, I guess this is kind of a story we've been talking in the past
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   about Google print, which is Google's plan to scan every book in existence and sell it
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   page by page.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   And of course the publishers and the authors hate this.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   And they're suing Google and they're mad.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:03.600]   Amazon and Google both have announced a way to get micro payments for parts of books.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.800]   They're hoping to be able to sell for instance if you don't want to buy the whole cook but
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.520]   just want to buy a recipe, you pay 50 cents and you get the recipe page from that cook
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.280]   book.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.840]   And this might be the kind of thing that ends that lawsuit because now you're saying instead
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   of just taking the content.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.800]   I see the RA and the MPa here going to sue.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.680]   The office guild was very upset and publishers were very upset about Google print.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.760]   But this may solve that problem.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.680]   Microsoft signed a deal with the British Library to scan a hundred thousand books.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   Wow.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   Me too.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   Me too.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Well, right now you can get public domain stuff, not just Gutenberg but I think they're scanning
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.240]   Google scanning public domain stuff.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   The issue is how about these copyrighted books?
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.480]   What about everything since 1927?
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   Is that what it is?
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   24?
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.600]   It would be interesting to see.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.080]   I hope they do solve that.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:01.120]   That would be kind of the same idea we've got now for music and video.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   For print.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   Well, it's going to be interesting to watch because the print production model is difficult.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.840]   Well, and is there a market for books in the same way that there is for music and video?
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.960]   I like buying a book to be honest with you.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   I don't want to download a book.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   I just don't want to use it.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.520]   I can read a book.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   Steve Gibson talked me into downloading a trilogy of books.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.440]   It's a privilege sci-fi trilogy that you can buy the books.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.440]   They've printed it.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.040]   But for 15 bucks I got three books and I got an e-reader format so I'm going to try it out.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.080]   Try it on a good handheld.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.800]   The best looking ebook out there is the Sony Libre which is impossible to get in the US.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   It's in Japanese only.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.640]   They have this insanely locked down.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.600]   The Sony we're talking about, insanely locked down content delivery system.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.480]   They keep coming up, don't they?
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.640]   It's Sony Day here.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.040]   What is it?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.840]   They also have one of the first true digital paper readouts where it basically flips the
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.520]   pixels and you have what ascends to look like a very good printed page and then you
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.200]   go to the next page and the next page.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   It's funny.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.240]   I've been reading books on computers on and off since William Gibson's third book.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   Really?
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.240]   You read it on a computer?
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   You read it on a Mac actually.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   Wow.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.720]   I think it also depends on what kind of book you're looking at.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.560]   When I read something that's fiction or even something that's kind of in depth that I'm
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:28.480]   going to read linearly, then I think about, oh, I really want it on paper for me.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:33.440]   When I want to have a reference, when I'm referencing post production for film or whatever, or like
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.480]   for instance, Apple probably does a better job of their manuals for their pro apps like
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.000]   Final Cut Pro or whatever.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.960]   I've never opened their manual because the manual is built into the app.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.080]   I sit there and I can search, I'm constantly going, where is slip cut?
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.160]   Well, that's what, have you used Safari online?
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.440]   I mean, that's the greatest.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.760]   Safari is a Riley Pearson, a number of other computer book publishers and they put all
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   their books online.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.000]   You pay a fee and you can have a bookshelf.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.960]   You pay a big enough fee.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.000]   You can have every book, thousands of computer books.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.560]   And then you're looking for a Pearl One Liner.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.120]   You type it in and it searches through all these books and it'll bring up the relevant
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   page.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   You can read them online.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.120]   You can annotate them.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   Safari is very cool.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.120]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   It works well with computer books.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   You write reference material.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.240]   I'm not sure I want to read War and Peace on my computer.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.240]   But I'm going to try it.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.640]   I'm going to try it with this, with this entaure's trilogy.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   As I'll admit, I actually do read more, like just print documents on ever since I got
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   an LCD monitor.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   I go forward with the CRT.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   It is better.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   I couldn't do it.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   My eyes would bleed after me.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   No, you're right.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   It is much better.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   Literally.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.480]   I stopped using CRTs about three or four years ago and I won't, like I won't turn one
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   on anymore.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   Right.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.640]   Like I just, the memories of my little pupils going back and forth really, really fast is
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.320]   when you used to have an even 10 hour day and you'd look away and your eyes are going
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.640]   back and forth and back and forth.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:53.200]   You know, as I, LCD only, I still work in 90, oh man, I was in 92, was doing basically
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.800]   living inside a Photoshop, you know, doing pixel by pixel corrections on a 15 inch, you
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.000]   know, the member 15 inch monitors with the big round screen.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.160]   My dad still has one.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   Oh.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   And it was like, I did that.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.760]   I didn't understand that you can't work for 12 to 14 hours.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.440]   I mean, we're in four inches from a, from a, I would see an optometrist, one of the funniest
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.480]   conversations I ever had that like, you work on a computer, don't you?
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   Uh huh.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.200]   Like you have to look away from the computer and refocus your eyes every couple hours and
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.760]   like, cool, the pain stuff.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.600]   And they're like, uh huh.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.560]   And Lucas, for my stuff, I, I, I stopped being able to see more than about three feet
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.760]   in front of me, you know, because we were working some long hours for SW one and that
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.480]   was the, that was the problem.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.640]   You know, don't, you gotta look away.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.960]   You can't look at the pod race.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.440]   Look away from the pod race.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.280]   Now I have a question for, for Patrick.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.320]   I have a specific opinion here.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.480]   So now if you've seen in the register, they have this thing where they, there's an opinion
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.360]   article is CEOs should follow the NBA and make geeks wear real clothes.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.760]   Have you seen this?
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.800]   What do you mean real clothes like this?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Exactly.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.360]   And for the audio commentary, Leo is, is in a fashionable.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   It's a smock.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   A smock.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.000]   I'm wearing a smock.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   This is an NBA.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   You worked out last week.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   I'm wearing a smock.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.520]   I've just never seen you in this before.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   I don't know why I'm wearing it.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   It's very exciting.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   It's very San Francisco.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   It's uninhifting.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   It is.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   Except, well, he's wearing pants under it.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   So it's not like he's missing around.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   That's my mistake.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   Should I take off my pants?
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   Because then it would really be much more, much more kill.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.800]   Now I'm really, I mean, the music is just a comedy.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.160]   Try wearing pants under a kill?
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   No, no.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   Wear that.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   That one?
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.360]   What if they want, they want, they say that the CEO should, should, should dress geeks,
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.160]   you know, we should, we should dress up in suits like you would have like, wow, it's
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.160]   what for?
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.920]   I guess the big question is what for the old IBM guys used to do when they started
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.320]   a company's songbook and had to wear a garter?
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.120]   Well, I mean, but there's environments where geeks wear suits.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   Right.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.720]   You know, it's like Wall Street guys, when they're going in to seal a deal, I mean,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.920]   they don't walk in like, you know, this is Harry and Harry is the classic geek with
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.680]   like the giant beard and, you know, looking like he just dropped a six pack in the middle
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   of his chest.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.720]   But the man, you know, somebody's like, you know, my mother, Shiver, here's, is going
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   to hurt me.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   No, she'll laugh and she'll hurt me.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.520]   But like, it's like, I've built my entire career about wanting to be able to be respected
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.720]   and still live in hooded sweatshirts.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.520]   And you've succeeded, I think, mapper, play in that.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.720]   You're the king of the hoodie.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:21.400]   If you ever fly in an airplane with Patrick Norton on a flight this more than an hour
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.040]   long, you'll see him hunched over in a corner with the hoodies and it's zip tied all the
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.880]   way down so you can see the little strings popping out right here and you're just sitting
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   there like, I'm gone.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.280]   That's the hoods more.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   Our congratulations to race Lekinsky.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.680]   Remember him from I Potter X?
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.480]   He and his wife Shannon had a baby, a baby boy on October 23rd.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.280]   You finally got around telling the world, Aiden McLaughlin's Lekinsky.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   And Chris Kosatch and Alex, well, on our moving to DC.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   Alex has got a job.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.840]   You remember Alex from Cyber Crime?
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.240]   He's got a job as senior producer for CNN.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   Wow.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.640]   So we have friends in high places.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.600]   And Chris Kosatch was working for the travel channel last time I talked to her.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   Just some updates.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   You're doing a few things for CNET.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   She's doing CNET too for Alex.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.840]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.840]   Congratulations to the folks.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   Alex published two books, right?
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.920]   "A More Man" and something else.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.520]   Yeah, Alex is a stud.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:18.320]   And he started with-- he was a writer for a TV show called "One of Those Earlier Legal
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.080]   Shows," like right before.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   "Jutie?"
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   "Jutie" is a rare project.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   Well, after that, but--
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   Well, after that, yeah.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.920]   --they did "Cymer Crime" on tech TV, then he and his partner left and went down to the
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   LA thing.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.120]   He was also a pretty hardcore lawyer before he came out to do the television thing.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   That's right.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   More careers than anyone I know.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.760]   And they're all at a high, very successful level.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.280]   The cutest girl at tech TV.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   So we--
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   And he also--
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   I'm not sure if he ever had a tattoo cut.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   He's a good kid.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.080]   He's the hand two-sided ping-pong paddle.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Remember that?
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.480]   We had him on the screen savers talking about that.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.520]   Boy, that was a soft segment.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   Must have been out that day.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   He was on call for help in short.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   You were there at that meeting.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.320]   Oh, it was a call for help, all right.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.200]   So you had to get pads or how did you have a pad and--
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   Oh, that's what it is.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.320]   I had the hall in Halley's old ping-pong table.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.200]   How to get a pad.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:19.600]   So I think we pretty much kind of run out of steam on this one here.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.640]   So I thank you all for being here.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.880]   We want to thank the folks speaking of plugs at AOL Radio who broadcast this show.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.680]   And cover our gigantic bandwidth.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680]   You can see it.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   I appreciate them all.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.680]   Every more and more every day.

[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.240]   There goes the pizza hut sponsorship.
