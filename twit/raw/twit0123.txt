[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.820]   Everybody's already heard it.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.120]   Joining us on the panel and being very quiet now.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.800]   Mr. John C. Devoreak.org/blog, take a drink.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.440]   Hey there.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.860]   Good to have you?
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.560]   Vodka.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.440]   Vodka.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.400]   Is that your drink of choice?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.300]   I thought it was --
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900]   [ Buzzer ]
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.840]   No, but that's what I recommend.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.780]   Mainly because it's gonna be less likely to give
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.980]   somebody a headache if we say devoreak.org/blog enough.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.880]   [ Buzzer ]
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.880]   We will also welcome Mr. Will Harris from England.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hello.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   Or you cannot get a Kindle.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.120]   No.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.320]   But you can get an iPhone.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.200]   We also --
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.460]   It sucks being you, doesn't it, Will?
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.060]   It does, apart from my marvelous, you know,
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.900]   internet video at channelflip.com.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.240]   It's all -- it's all terrible.

[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   Take three drinks.

[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.840]   Callie Lewis from geekbrief.tv, dkeitircallie.com.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.940]   And now the iUEL.tv.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.920]   Hey, Callie.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   Hey.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.080]   Just watch for a moment.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.480]   John, you're gonna wish you had this idea.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.880]   This is such a good idea.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.240]   You'll log for your iPhone.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.440]   Well, just a burning log?
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.240]   Yeah, with some music.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.720]   Go to iULE.tv.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.920]   This is so brilliant.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   It's basically for us, it's a way to bring
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.560]   some much deserved attention to Jeff Smith
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.460]   and to raise some money for charity
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.820]   and to experiment with the whole idea of premium RSS
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.020]   content.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.400]   Basically, it's, you know, a fireplace.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.300]   The crackling audio is in there,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.500]   and Jeff Smith's original score.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.700]   And to me, it's the results are hypnotic.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300]   And at $5 a pop could be quite lucrative.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   Yes.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.180]   Well, I think we're splitting the pop that's in charity.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.420]   I like the story, though, that you got this idea
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.300]   from Timothy Ferris and his four hour work week.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.900]   Right.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.300]   Yeah, I'm actually getting to interview Tim soon,
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.780]   hopefully this week.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.540]   He always talks about virtual products
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.180]   and making products that you can set up
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.380]   and then be able to let somebody else handle the dealings
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.020]   of it.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.540]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780]   You know who he got this idea from his PUD.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.980]   I'll talk about it in a second.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.380]   I'll explain.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.780]   PUD.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.820]   The guy who started F Company, he told me this.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.300]   He said, here's how I get rich.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.980]   I start websites that I don't have to run.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.300]   They just run themselves like F Company.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.940]   And then it's an annuity.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.820]   In fact, I had a manager call me up a couple of weeks ago
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.020]   saying, layout, layout.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.180]   Yeah, I can imagine him with a cigar.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.140]   Layout, you're not making all the money you could.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.260]   Layout, the key is a noity.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.060]   He says, shut up a noity.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.220]   He says, you just make your money.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.580]   You just make your money.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.100]   Said, yeah.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.420]   OK, he waits for you, Leo.
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.940]   I like it.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.140]   Also, you're--
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.940]   I challenge you to do the whole show in that voice.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.100]   No, you don't.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.860]   Because I'll do it, and you'll be sorry.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.100]   Also, you're Don Reisinger, who's wishing he was not right now.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.420]   But he doesn't come bearing a Yule log,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.300]   but he comes bearing his very own URL.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.980]   It's about time, right, Leo?
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.340]   It's about time, digitalhome.cnet.com.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.700]   Yeah, you have to make sure it's throwing the in there.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.380]   Also, it won't work.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.900]   The?
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.740]   Oh, well, who--
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.500]   Somebody else has the--
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.420]   The digital home.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.540]   They couldn't give you two?
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.140]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.980]   It goes to another digital home part of the site.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.140]   So I guess we got thrown in the--
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.420]   so it's the digitalhome.cnet.com.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.660]   We got all set.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.540]   And it never ends, does it?
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.140]   And it still resolves to these funky numeric things
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.900]   from vignette, these lousy URLs, these SEO bad SEO URLs.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.180]   OK, that's the panel.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.940]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.620]   We'll see you later.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.380]   Bye-bye.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.540]   Bye.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   Bye.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.740]   Wouldn't it be funny?
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.020]   We did a six-minute twit.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.100]   Does everybody want home?
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.700]   I think it actually--
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   It actually--
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   It's a--
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.100]   --in improvement.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.540]   It would be an improvement, I think.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.300]   Everybody love it.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.100]   So I guess since Callie has a Kindle,
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.500]   we could talk a little bit about the Kindle.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.220]   John, what do you think of the idea before we get to Callie?
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.540]   Well, I think you know what I think,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.820]   or you wouldn't even ask me.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.100]   You're going to give Mr. Cranky Pants before?
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.140]   Yeah, Cranky Pants, take the floor.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.660]   The likelihood of this thing being successful is, let's see,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.580]   zero.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.420]   I guess the Sony readers only sold a handful.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.460]   42.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.140]   42 of them.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.980]   And Scoble, who was real hot on this now, Scoble,
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.660]   in fact, I should get him on.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.100]   He says, here's my one-week review of Amazon Skittle.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.100]   He couldn't wait.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.580]   I've read two books on it.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.140]   And that's why I haven't tweeted much.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.180]   He drinks a lot of coffee.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.140]   I focus on a few areas.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.020]   No ability to buy paper goods from Amazon through Kindle.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.900]   Usability sucks.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.620]   UI sucks.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.460]   No abilities and electronic goods to anyone else.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.580]   I know.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.540]   No social network.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.660]   No social network.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.700]   Do you want Facebook on Kindle?
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.540]   Well, we don't need another social network.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.820]   I want Twitter on my Kindle.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.020]   If you want to do a social network is the answer to everything.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.540]   For Scoble.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.460]   Scoble, peace will solve it through a social network.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.060]   No touch screen.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.580]   It doesn't wait.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.540]   It stops, stops, stops.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.980]   It doesn't have a touch screen at all.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.980]   No.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.740]   No.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.140]   Why?
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.220]   Has that goofy little scroll?
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.820]   No, I should say Callie's going to say likes this.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.820]   But I haven't--
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.140]   By the time we're done with her, she's not going to say anything.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.020]   Not true.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.060]   No, Callie's got the guts to stand up to strong personal--
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.700]   Stand up and crawl a piece of crap.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.220]   Great.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.740]   Hey, Don.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.500]   Either the hardware does have some issues
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.940]   that need some improvement.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.340]   But this thing, I think, is strong.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.620]   And we're comparing a first gen device here
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.620]   to a fifth gen iPod.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.300]   I keep approaching it as a touch screen or I did it first.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.340]   But it may be the case with Kindle
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.620]   that people wait until the fifth or sixth gen.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.580]   But I hope not.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.340]   I hope that people early adopt.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.780]   And it becomes something great.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.260]   Because I think that--
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.260]   Because you want them to jump start.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.740]   --the reading experience right.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.620]   You want us early adopters to jump start the thing
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.060]   so that there's a marketplace.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.620]   Yes.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.380]   Please go out and buy it.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.700]   And why are there by a you'll log for your iPhone?
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.100]   Because they're great, too.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.020]   Yes.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.700]   Or your TV or your Apple TV or your Zoom.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.820]   Does anybody else have a Kindle?
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.540]   Do you have one, Don?
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.220]   Have you played with it?
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.700]   No.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.940]   No.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.340]   I only wrote up a column saying the same thing John says.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.500]   It's going to be a total another flop.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.980]   My first reaction was that here is an example
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.380]   of a product designed around a business model,
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.980]   not around what customers want.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.340]   This is a way for Amazon to make money.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.620]   How can we package this so we make more money?
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.140]   Everything's DRM.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.180]   Everything's through Amazon.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.620]   You rent.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.500]   You don't buy.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.020]   It's $0.10 just to mail yourself a PDF.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.500]   Wow.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.060]   Oh, but it's not just $0.10.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   It's $0.10.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.820]   That's a convenience charge.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.060]   If you were willing to use the USB connection,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.460]   then you can get it for free.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.500]   All you have to do is send an email to your username
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   at free.kindle.com.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.740]   And it converts it, send it back to you.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.180]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.420]   You have the USB connection to get it on your Kindle for free.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.740]   So if you send a PDF, it'll convert it to the MOBY format?
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.260]   Right.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.780]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.820]   And I think it's important that they give us
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.700]   that option.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.740]   So we have wireless for a fee or another way for free.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.700]   Well, the wireless is basically--
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.500]   the thing that kind of makes me like this--
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.340]   and I already bought a Sony e-book reader.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.140]   I already spent 300 bucks on that twice,
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.740]   because I left one there.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.940]   How much money do you make, Leo?
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.420]   You just throw money away left and right.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.620]   John, I feel that it's my fiduciary responsibility.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.340]   That's what I like to know.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.620]   I'll buy you lunch.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.820]   Just come over.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.540]   It's my fiduciary responsibility as the chief
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.780]   twit to purchase and try these products.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.140]   I don't want to buy a Kindle, but I feel I must.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.460]   I think you're crazy.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:54.780]   Really?
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.860]   Well, should we take it from the top like hardware design?
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.780]   OK, so yes, that's the weak point.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.740]   It looks oddly.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.820]   Although, you know, I've talked to somebody who said,
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.340]   this is like an Apple design.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.060]   This is beautiful.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860]   So I guess that's--
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.460]   Really?
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.720]   I think it looks like Pre-IPod.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.300]   Ugly.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.460]   Pre-IPod.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.380]   Looks like a '90s PC.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.180]   That's what I think it does.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.200]   I could see John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.920]   carrying this around in Greece.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.020]   Totally.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.160]   Right?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.520]   Yeah, I don't think it looks like something new.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.900]   I think they've been working on this for, I think,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.920]   it's been three years.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.000]   Three years.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.360]   It looks like a Commodore 64.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.160]   It's that old kind of feel.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   I'm willing to bet that the design wasn't what they spent
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.720]   three years on.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.440]   It was mostly two years.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.760]   No, I think you have to reevaluate.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.880]   The three years were spent between 1984.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.080]   Jeff Bezos was designing this in college.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.800]   Supposedly, it's designed by a company that is in Cupertino.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.920]   Not Apple.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.440]   No, it's called Lab 3.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.840]   I can't-- I can't-- I mean, I mean,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.160]   you think this thing has like real potential.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.400]   I mean, the idea of like--
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.920]   Thank you, Will.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.320]   I mean, this is a first-gen device, right?
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.160]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.680]   But when you get to the point where you've got one reader that
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.920]   has all your books and your papers and blogs that'll fit
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.720]   in your pocket-- and OK, so this isn't it just yet.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   But you can see now how we get from here to there.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.640]   We're on the laptop.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.960]   I'm not sure we could.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.200]   And I mean, look at-- you know, the fact
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.560]   it's got Evdo built in for the wireless.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.720]   I mean, that's like the killer application tool.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.360]   I'm hungry.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.320]   You know, buying a book while you're on the go.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   You're on the train.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.880]   I need something to read.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   All right, I'll just buy a book.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   That's what I like about it.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.000]   So Will, I take it your negotiations on your website
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.280]   with Amazon.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.560]   No, they are talking to just--
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   I mean, the number of blogs you get there are very limited.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   And it's not-- the screen is an E-ink.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.040]   It's not fast enough to do video.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.760]   You get devorac.org/blog.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.240]   Blogging.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   It's like-- it's all AA lists, double A list.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.280]   In fact, it's mostly corporate.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.760]   A lot of sports blogs.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.200]   Well, screw it.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.480]   It is a first-gen device.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.080]   But if you don't think this is the future,
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.040]   then you don't read science fiction books.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.680]   We're not going to be using paper forever.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.000]   And this is the best effort so far, don't you think?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.680]   Flying cars are just around the corner.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   I think they're exactly why they got the cover.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.280]   That's why they got the cover of Newsweek,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.440]   because Newsweek and Stephen Levy bought into the notion
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.480]   that, oh, it's a future.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.360]   Someday everybody will read books this way.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.880]   I can't get past the price.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.600]   I mean, $400 for a place that'll let me read a book.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.920]   I said this in the column, and I got beat up for it a little bit.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.840]   But I see-- you know, I mean, it's a $400
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   voice that'll allow me to read a book.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   I mean, don't have eyes for that.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.680]   Those come free.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.360]   And you still have to pay for the book.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.720]   And you're still paying for the book.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.640]   That's ridiculous.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.120]   Well, the book--
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.560]   Yeah, I think they should lower it to what?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.000]   100?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.000]   40, 95.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.440]   Yeah, they got 50.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.120]   They got to pay--
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.200]   Spray it looks.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.360]   They got to pay three.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.880]   All the day or something.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.640]   You can quite easily-- I know you, Leo.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.600]   You take a bag of books of hardbacks and paper books
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.800]   and whatever.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.720]   How much easier is it to just take one little device?
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.440]   Well, that's exactly why I got the Sony ebook reader,
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.680]   because I wanted a bunch of books.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.520]   But the advantage the Kindle has, they're a couple.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.160]   First of all, their books are half the price
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.240]   the Sony books are.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.600]   You don't have to use a Sony store.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.960]   You can just do it wireless.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.680]   You don't even have to go online.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   You just do it from Kindle.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.720]   So in fact, the Kindle is like a book for power.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.200]   And here's the real reason I got it.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.000]   And actually, why I'm a little excited about it.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.880]   I have every week a stack about three foot tall of newspapers
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.520]   and magazines that I recycle.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.280]   I now have-- I subscribe on the Kindle.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:26.720]   I'm a got it.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.240]   Yeah, I won't get it for a couple of weeks,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.440]   because they're back-ordered because it's selling so well.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   At least five a day.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.000]   I got the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Times,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.560]   the Wall Street Journal, Salon, and the Onion.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.160]   And I subscribed to all of those on there.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.480]   And they'll be delivered automatically,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   three in the morning, every morning.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.960]   Leo, how much time do you spend in front of a computer?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.840]   I mean, everywhere you go, I mean, at least myself.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.040]   I mean, I can access those on the computer.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.520]   You know, I can have my laptop and go wherever
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.600]   I can read those on a laptop.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.240]   I mean, to me at least, it just--
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.800]   I'd rather look at it on the computer, number one.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   Number two, if I have access to it on something,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.520]   I don't have to spend extra $400 for.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.080]   I don't know.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.000]   I can't justify--
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.400]   I agree with-- well, I'm sorry.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.720]   I agree with that.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.280]   It just seems to me that you're on the computer all the time.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.720]   What do you need this redundancy for?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.600]   It's ridiculous.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   Come on.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.840]   It's for breakfast.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.280]   Surely.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.120]   So when you're sitting down, you want to read paper.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.760]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.120]   Don't want to read paper.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.200]   You want the Kindle.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.320]   Can you imagine, Leo's there in the morning.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.760]   He's sitting in his underpants.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.200]   And he's got his bowl of corn.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.720]   I don't want to imagine it.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   He's got his Kindle in his hand and a spoon in the oven.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.760]   It's the perfect side of the morning.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.080]   I just don't drop the thing in the oatmeal.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.600]   And then when you have to go to the bathroom,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.120]   you take it with you to the bathroom.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.200]   This is a feisty bunch.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.360]   We don't drop it in the toilet.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.320]   Yeah, still drop it in the toilet.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.920]   ValleyWag has an interview with a designer of the Kindle,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.480]   by the way.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.560]   And I want to thank TTK in our chat room who
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.200]   was watching live.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.440]   His name is Robert Brunner.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.240]   He was the guy who designed the PowerBook.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.280]   He was at Pentagram.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.720]   He went to--
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.280]   Which PowerBook are we talking about?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.520]   The original iconic, the one you like so very much--
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:01.960]   I don't know.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   The toilet?
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:02.760]   The toilet?
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.560]   I don't know the toilet.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.080]   The toilet seat one?
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.560]   It would make sense, wouldn't it?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.280]   It doesn't say.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.160]   It just says the original iconic PowerBook.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.920]   He has his own Prox Design Studio ammunition.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.640]   And that was who worked with Amazon's Lab 126
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.840]   to design the Kindle.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.480]   You know, let's wrap up this review,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.360]   because let's face it.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.320]   There's going to be people who are going
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.240]   to have to judge for themselves.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.440]   You could put a bet down, if anybody's willing.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:27.960]   OK.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.840]   But this thing's going to be--
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.560]   what's your bet?
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.200]   No, I'm not betting.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.040]   Callie and you were betting.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.840]   She's got no-- she's got no--
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.440]   she's got no--
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.640]   She's going to have so much money because of this eye
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.240]   you'll think.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.360]   Yeah, I'll play the bet if people will buy the aisle.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.760]   She's going to-- she's got-- I'm telling you,
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.320]   she'll make half a million dollars this year on the eye
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.120]   you'll alone.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.440]   That is going to be a hit product.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   If you keep promoting it, there's no question about it.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.760]   That's my goal.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.280]   I just want a little cut, that's all.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.120]   All right, so you're right.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.560]   Let's wait.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.320]   So what's the bet, John?
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.720]   I don't know.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.400]   I'm going to have to think about it, because Callie,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.600]   how much do you want to put down 100 bucks?
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.640]   But we got to come up with something.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.160]   No, put something more than that.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.080]   Say, I don't know.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.760]   You would let her host Cranky Geeks.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.960]   She can host Cranky Geeks.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.800]   She never shows up.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.280]   And she would let you host--
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.760]   What?
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.200]   She's in Texas.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.400]   She would--
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.240]   I'm going out to San Francisco, though, on a long time.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.720]   And she would let you host Geek Brief TV for one day.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.240]   I could do that.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.640]   How about that for a bet?
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   OK.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.560]   That means she's going to--
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.760]   Wait a minute, how does it--
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   I will pay the airfarer.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.400]   It's like I lose on both accounts.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.720]   I can't lose the amount.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.040]   I will pay airfarer travel expenses for whoever
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.000]   loses to go to that direction.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.240]   How about that?
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   I don't know why I'm involved, but I will.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.880]   I need a trip to Texas.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.680]   But we have to decide what the bet is.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.880]   That's the problem.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   I mean, what constitutes a flop?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   Yeah, we have to decide.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   Because basically I'm betting on flop.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.720]   She's betting on, well, it's just the beginning of a great,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.640]   long-term thing.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.680]   Maybe the bet won't--
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.880]   OK, here's how about the--
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.360]   OK, here.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.320]   Amazon quietly discontinues the Kindle within two years.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.760]   No, I'm not going to say that because they're going to upgrade it.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.520]   And you're going to say, I can make the claim that, hey, the Kindle--
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.160]   the original was not being made anymore.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.800]   And you say, yeah, of course not, they upgraded it.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.320]   We can't.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   I mean, no, it's not to be sell figures.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.280]   Because they'll never release sales figures.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Let me think about it, and then we'll do the bet on the show
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.880]   in the next couple weeks.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.920]   We'll figure it out.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.640]   OK.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.400]   But I like that.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.600]   I like that to make because it's like, what's flop?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.000]   You need to be measurable.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.600]   You need a measurable quantifiable--
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.200]   OK, talking about predictions and philosophies.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.720]   Let me bring something up real quick.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.280]   I'm only going to do this for the audience out there,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.440]   especially the people that live in West Virginia.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.600]   OK.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.960]   You know, I'm a college football nut last year, for those--
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.880]   I knew this was an Apple.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.840]   --at a Latin state fan from the beginning,
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.040]   because I knew this team was great.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.680]   But since the beginning of this year,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.120]   I've been a huge West Virginia fan, and they're
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   great spread off, and some believable team.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.400]   They are going to win the national championship.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.000]   I'm making the same offer I did last year.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.200]   Anyone who wants to get me one of those West Virginia WV,
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.480]   the fancy look in--
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.160]   Who would have untwitted?
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.200]   --loved to get it.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.680]   You can send it to me at john@devork.org email.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.960]   And I'll wear the thing.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.680]   I'll give you a credit on the show, just like I did with the other guys.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.800]   Are you wearing the Appalachian state right now?
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.680]   Appalachian.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.080]   Pardon me.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.640]   It's getting straight.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.600]   Sorry.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.080]   They always get notes when you just pronounce it.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.200]   It's Nevada, not Nevada.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.920]   I have a-- I got a few of those, and those are great.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.280]   Still, the team could still win again.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.800]   But the point I'm trying to make here
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.720]   is that if this West Virginia wins the national championship,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.000]   which I predict they will, I'd like
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.400]   to get a national championship hoodie.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.280]   All right, deal.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.000]   That's it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.320]   Sorry.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.480]   It's my only begging for clothes.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.360]   I do that once a year.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.000]   I love it.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's a holiday thing.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's a tradition unto it.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.040]   We just-- John begs for clothes.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   It's just part of the whole--
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.000]   But only cool clothes is something I can wear around Berkeley.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.280]   I still have those University of Pennsylvania sweatshirts.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.760]   You never really wanted to wear those, I guess.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.840]   No, nobody does.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.600]   Moving right along to our next story--
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.560]   what is our next story?
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.000]   Oh, I could tell you our next story.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.880]   Big problems in Britain, and that's
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.080]   where Will Harris is in Oxford.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   With the iPhone, apparently, the iPhone signal sucks.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.480]   You're experiencing that right now, right?
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.720]   Well--
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.200]   So, yeah, it seems to have started
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.840]   with a thread on the Apple support
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.200]   forums, which are legendary for their complete uselessness.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.040]   Because they'll ban you if anything sucks right away.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.960]   So this guy just posts and says, hey, I just got an O2 iPhone.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.480]   Does the signal suck for anybody else?
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.720]   And it turns out that it's got hundreds and hundreds
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.320]   of replies and thousands of views from people saying, yeah,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.600]   the reception here is absolutely appalling.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.080]   And the thing is, people have got--
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.600]   so the network over here is O2.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   That's the exclusive carrier.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   They're sort of the AT&T.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.920]   And people have got standard O2 phones
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.880]   and get like a five-bar signal.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.400]   And then iPhone on O2 and get like one bar signal
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.360]   in exactly the same place, like one in each hand.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.440]   And so a lot of people have been complaining that, you know,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.600]   what's wrong is it like the iPhone that's faulty?
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   Is it the network that's faulty?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.480]   And the weird thing is that the iPhone
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.240]   seems to get like a signal bump in power.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.040]   Whenever you put it in the dock, like it doesn't even
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.880]   have to be plugged in.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.440]   It's just like putting it in the dock amplifies the signal.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.560]   Well, yeah, it's like a big antenna.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.040]   So if only you could just like walk around with a dock
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.400]   attached to the bottom while you were talking on it.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.480]   It would be perfect.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.320]   But there's so far there's been no official response
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.760]   from Apple or O2.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.840]   There's just a lot of really cheesed off.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.720]   You need like a metal plate in your head.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.040]   Then that'd be awesome.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.760]   How bad is it?
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.240]   Well, I mean, is it awful?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.440]   Or is it so?
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.320]   I mean, so in my office, I get five bars on Vodafone.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.880]   So full signal on Vodafone, no service on my iPhone O2.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.280]   Is that on the same network?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.840]   No, it's a different network.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.040]   But if you get another O2 phone in my office, I get five bars.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   Oh, so it's bad design, maybe.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.200]   Well, maybe it's just pretty awful, really.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.680]   Hmm.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.880]   And then walk around.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.920]   The story sounds fishy.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.680]   And then my local borders, I get five bars on Vodafone,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   five bars on any O2 handset, and two bars on iPhone.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.720]   Maybe they forgot to put the antenna in the phone's
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.920]   station.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.200]   Well, you joke.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.440]   But it's not out of the realms of possibility
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.760]   that the phones are getting shipped over here are just daft.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.360]   They're what?
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.000]   Daft.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.640]   Daft.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   Daft.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.200]   Daft?
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.640]   Daft.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.560]   Like daft beer in--
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.800]   Ooh, daft--
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Dafone.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.080]   You know, busted.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.600]   Broken.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.960]   I want you to say busted, then.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.080]   I like daft.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.320]   How do you spell that, D-U-F-F?
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.360]   I never--
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.160]   Are you crazy, Mary?
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.560]   I was trying to do that to confuse us.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.320]   Who's that?
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.560]   It is Robert Scobble.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.720]   Oh, man, wait a minute.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.920]   Robert Scobble's on the line.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.960]   Robert has a--
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.880]   many people don't realize this.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.720]   Robert has a backdoor entrance to it.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.280]   He can call in anytime he wants.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.800]   So Robert, Dvorak thinks the kindles a piece of crap.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.760]   Callie Lewis, who's also on the line with us,
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.520]   thinks it's great.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   She loves hers.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.720]   I've ordered one.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.360]   Dvorak and Callie now have a bet,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.560]   although we haven't figured out exactly what the parameters are.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.920]   But we do know that if he wins, she'll--
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.960]   We didn't determine which is a winner and which is a loser.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.840]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.480]   That's the problem.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.240]   If he wins, either he'll host her show or she'll host his show.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.480]   We don't know which one is a winning proposition.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.120]   But you know, John, you're more
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.520]   than welcome to Host Geek Brief anytime.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.880]   Doesn't have to be that.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.000]   Things just all get paid and she gets to do the work.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.600]   There you go.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.560]   So if you win, John, she makes-- she does your show.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.280]   Anyway, Robert, what do you think?
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.160]   I read your blog post.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.360]   You didn't seem to like it that much.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.400]   Yeah, I just ripped them.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.120]   I just did a video where I ripped the thing, the shreds.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.600]   So it's a device I want to love.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.280]   And I'm sort of in Cali's camp because for me,
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.560]   it's like cool geeky.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.760]   What's wrong with it?
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.880]   We read your six points.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.720]   I can't say that it needs a social network.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.200]   Yeah, that's pretty weird.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.800]   Well, I mean, if I knew you had one of these,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.120]   why shouldn't I be able to see what kinds of books
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.600]   you're reading?
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.320]   Because that's Facebook beacon, which we'll get to in a moment.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.280]   Yeah, well, you know.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.960]   I actually like that idea.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.560]   OK, leave that idea out.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.640]   First of all, when you hold the device,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   everybody have handed this to, has picked it up,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.920]   and has flipped the page accidentally,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.640]   because the buttons are right where you--
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.040]   Everybody agrees that button shouldn't be there.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.520]   And it's just not designed to be held.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.440]   I did a video where I showed where I hold this device,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.600]   and there's no place to put your thumb.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.400]   You know?
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.360]   Hey, Robert, have you tried holding it in the palm
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.080]   of your hand?
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.760]   Have you found a way that works for you?
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.560]   I have a--
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.960]   It's a goofy-- I showed it in my video.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   It's a goofy way to hold it.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.560]   It's only one little place on the left where you can put your thumb.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.600]   You look like a Buddhist.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.040]   Yeah, you're still talking about the Kindle, right?
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.720]   What do you think?
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.200]   All right, you showed it to Mike Arrington.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.160]   Oh, you immediately panicked.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.200]   Let me play the recording you made of Mike Arrington's
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.760]   review of the Kindle.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.400]   This is from Scobolizer's Scobolizer.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.320]   So any minute now, we should be able to hear him saying something.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.520]   I can't hear a thing.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.880]   He's not saying anything.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.160]   Is there an audio issue with--
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.080]   With Kite?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.960]   That didn't mean--
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.080]   Who the audio was turned off?
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.680]   I guess the last time I used Kite,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   I didn't have any audio on it.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.200]   Let me turn the audio on.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.480]   Here's-- this is Arrington.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.520]   We can't get him on the show, but at least we could play a video
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   you made of him.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.320]   So, so Mike, you hate the Kindle?
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.160]   Are we recording?
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.960]   Who are recording?
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.120]   I'm not comfortable on the camera.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.480]   Where the hell are we?
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.160]   Anyway, we're at the Orange Party.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   What does he say something?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.800]   We're not live at the point, right?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.400]   What does he say?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.720]   At the end of sketch, well, not as functional as a Kindle
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.760]   while they really close up.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.320]   Stay close to the Mike Fixies.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   Connectivity.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.200]   Well, I give up.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.800]   What does he say?
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.400]   He doesn't like it.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.440]   That was fantastic.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.840]   I know.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.120]   Great audio, great video.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.960]   I'll tell you.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.800]   Robert?
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.720]   This is audio show.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.640]   Video doesn't translate very well.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   I can't move for you.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.840]   Yeah, the video didn't transfer.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.840]   He instantly started playing with a menu and said, this just sucks.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.640]   But you know, the thing is you've tried it for longer.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.720]   Callie's tried it for longer.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   That's who I'm more interested in.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.080]   People who've had some time with it.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.680]   Did you read-- you said you read two books on it.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.760]   And once you actually get into reading a book
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.800]   and flipping pages and get comfortable with holding it
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.440]   in a weird way, it actually--
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.080]   the device starts to disappear.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.600]   And that's--
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.040]   Well, that's OK then.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.440]   I mean, I got used to using the Sony ebook reader.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.040]   There's things I hate about it.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.640]   Do you get the page turn flash on the Kindle?
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.040]   Yes.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.560]   I hate that.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.800]   That's an e-ink problem.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.440]   Because of the screen technology it's using,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   which is actually flipping little balls back and forth.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.240]   It's not like an LCD screen, which means it works out right now.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.680]   By the way, John, that's your cue to say.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.000]   Are we talking about the Kindle still?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.440]   I mean, there's a lot of jokes here.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.040]   I'm going to tell you something right now, though.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.440]   I mean, I think we've been looking at the time
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.680]   where we've been talking about this thing for half an hour.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.840]   There's nobody's going to buy it or not buy it
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.280]   because of what we have to say.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.000]   I think we should let it settle out a little bit.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.520]   And we should go on to some other topics.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   No offense, Robert.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.040]   I agree.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.360]   But I want to say one thing.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.320]   Robert is bashing the Kindle.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.880]   And yet you're going to make money on the Kindle.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.640]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.480]   People could subscribe to the Scovolizer blog.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.800]   You're one of the few, the proud, the Kindle bloggers.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.520]   I have to pay two bucks a month to read something
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.640]   I could read free on the internet.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   And you get--
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.280]   Well, what's even funnier is if you learn how to use the Kindle,
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.120]   there's a free web browser in the experimental menu.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.640]   And actually, reading blogs in the free browser
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.280]   is actually better than reading them in the paid version.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.640]   Because the paid versions don't have comments.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.240]   And the free version has comments, so--
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.040]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.800]   I'm not a fine recommendation.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   All right.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.600]   I'm going to keep Robert on because why not?
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.800]   We've got the feistiest panel we've had in years,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   and nobody's going to have a chance to talk anyway.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.480]   Let me ask about-- and this is right up your wicket.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.200]   Let's talk about Facebook beacon.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.400]   Facebook's been getting a lot of heat over this advertising
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.360]   scheme, which nobody except Mark Zuckerman really
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   understands.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.160]   Zuckerberg.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.120]   Is it Burger Man?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.440]   I never--
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.960]   Zuckerberg.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.960]   Bird.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   Never-- I think he's the only guy who understands it.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.400]   The eye-- somehow, when you buy something on Fandango
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.760]   or overstock-- and I've tried this,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.040]   and it doesn't seem to do anything--
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.600]   but it will pop up of things saying,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.080]   do you want to share this with Facebook?
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.160]   And then it disappears.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.400]   And then you go to Facebook and says,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.680]   do you want to share this with your friends?
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.400]   And it disappears.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.680]   And then all of a sudden, your friends are seeing, hey, Leo
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.160]   just bought tickets to see Enchanted.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.720]   Maybe you'd like to go to.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.360]   Which is, I guess, a good way to do advertising.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.440]   People are upset, though, because they
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.880]   feel it's an invasion of their privacy.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.120]   Privacy is dead.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.400]   OK, so number one, why would you ever buy tickets
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.640]   to see Enchanted?
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   I loved it.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   It was a friendly movie.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.680]   There's a good point.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.120]   And right now--
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.440]   According to Twitter, everybody in the world
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.040]   went to go see Enchanted.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   It was a good movie.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.520]   I liked it.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.000]   The day after Thanksgiving.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.080]   And after that, I bought Crocs.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.760]   I'll tell you what, I went to go see No Country
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   for All Men last night.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.960]   Oh, that's supposed to be good.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   That's what I'm going to tell you.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.560]   See, I love the call.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.000]   You can't go wrong with the Colin Brothers.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.920]   As good as the Darjeeling Limited?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.200]   The G-W-A-L-A.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.040]   I'll do it now.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.600]   I'll do it now.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.760]   You'll talk to them.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.520]   Oh, come on.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.440]   The new Wes Anderson film, Jason Schwartzman.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440]   Is it good?
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.600]   Adrian Brody, it's absolutely insanely fantastic.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.320]   Yeah, the Colin Brothers and Wes Anderson
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.080]   are both the same level for me.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.480]   I mean, who needs Facebook?
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.040]   Why not just get a podcast?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.840]   And then everybody will know what you're doing through that.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.600]   This guy complains that his girlfriend
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.160]   bought him gloves for Hanukkah.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.800]   No, she bought her gloves for Hanukkah.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   And she found out about it because it said on Facebook,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.560]   "Hey, your boyfriend just bought gloves."
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.600]   No.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   And he's mad.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.520]   Just the one Leo where he was,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.240]   the guy was complaining about privacy concerns.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.920]   And he says, "What if I was seeing Fred Claus?"
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.520]   That would have been much more embarrassing.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.200]   That would be embarrassing.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.520]   Well, that's why I used Enchanted.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.240]   That's kind of embarrassing too.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   What is it all like?
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.800]   So what do we think about this?
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.840]   I mean, obviously Facebook, to get this whatever 800
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.160]   resilient dollar evaluation has to do something
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   to make some money.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.440]   You know, hey, can I say something here
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   just out of the blue?
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.440]   No.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.200]   So I finally signed up for Facebook.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   OK.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.560]   I'm the last scan of block here.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   Right now I'm the big group.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   Can you be my friend?
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   What is your--
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   It sucks.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   It stinks, OK?
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   That's all I got to say.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.080]   Well, I'm kind of in the same camp with you, John.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.280]   I don't get Facebook.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.840]   I have not adopted it at all.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   And I'm trying to.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.280]   Calla Canis talked about it on the last Twitter.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   Two tweets ago.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.320]   Calla Canis said that Robert Scobull's 5,000 Facebook
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.480]   friends are worth, what do you say?
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   20 cents each?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   He said a lot.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   Something like that.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.200]   And so, I mean, he kind of got me interested in trying to adopt it.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.880]   But I still haven't gotten there yet.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   I'm using it.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   I've approved everybody.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   I've got 1,500 friends.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   Now, who are you?
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.240]   Are you Dan Devorak, Angela Devorak, Christina Devorak, Jacob
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.800]   Devorak, which Devorak are you?
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   What difference does it make?
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   The thing stinks.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.120]   Why don't you like it, John?
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.280]   I don't like the interface.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.920]   I don't like the Mickey Mouse aspect.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.080]   I don't like the redundancies that are all over the place.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.640]   I don't like the layouts.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.920]   I don't like anything about it.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.960]   I don't like one thing about it.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.440]   I don't like the idea.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.800]   I don't like its trendiness.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.680]   I don't like anything about it.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   It's a joke.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.360]   You know what I like about it?
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.600]   I like it that I see I have all these friends, right, who are mostly fans.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   But that's fine.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.840]   These are your P1 fans.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.720]   These are the guys you really want to encourage because they care so much.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.640]   They want to be your Facebook friend.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.400]   What I do is I do it like the president.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.680]   The president, if you're over 100, you get a birthday card from the president.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   So what I do is when you have all these friends, every day, there's five or six people who
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   are having birthdays.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   I'll send them all greetings.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   Oh, that's fantastic, Leo.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   You're so nice.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   Is that nice?
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.920]   I think you like the president of Twitter.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   And then they feel like they were touched.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   They were touched by me.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.960]   I tried to do that with my space, but gave up on it quickly.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.520]   You know, I have to say everybody that's on these systems knows how sincere this must
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   be on your part.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.200]   It doesn't matter if you're sincere.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.960]   The matters you did it.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   You are being sincere by actually doing it.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   Isn't that the point?
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   He's not doing it.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.600]   It's all automated and everybody out there knows that a black so happy birthday is just
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.960]   as crappy and phony as a Facebook happy birthday coming from an automated robot.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.560]   I just typed happy birthday, Leo, to a guy named Andrew.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.760]   I better change that.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.760]   No, no.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   There we go.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   Andrew Kehaney's birthday.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   Isn't that cool?
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.400]   See, you know this stuff about your friends.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   You know what movies they see, what gloves they buy.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.600]   I think it's fun.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.840]   Now Robert, are there your, but they're not really your friends.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   Are they?
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   They're my community.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.960]   What your friends were seeing at the movies, you'd ring them up, wouldn't you?
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.200]   Well, I don't want to allow real friends on Facebook and Robert and others like him,
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.800]   like Justine convinced me that it was a valuable thing to Jason.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.080]   That was a valuable thing to add.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   Anybody who asked.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.760]   And now Robert's because Robert has like 7000 Twitter people he's following.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   And I asked you that, Robert.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   I said, isn't that crazy?
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   You see all this stuff?
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   You said no.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.480]   You said it's cool though to see what's going on.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   Absolutely.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.080]   And I have to say on Facebook, even though I only have 1500 friends, it's kind of cool
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.480]   to see all this activity.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.960]   And it's like having real friends.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.240]   They get out of that house once in a while.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.120]   It's kind of like having real friends.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.760]   Only you don't have to pay either a restaurant bill at the end of the night.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.360]   I'm going to start peeing in jars so everyone can leave the house.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.120]   Well, I think you've convinced me maybe.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   To me, Facebook is terrible.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   Facebook to me is a rolladax.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   It's like a white page phone book with benefits.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.800]   If I get to see a lot more detail about all my friends that I put in there.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   I like the idea of giving it, having a community of your kind of closest fans.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.920]   I mean, for a public figure, if somebody's broadcaster, for instance, this is a great
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.440]   way of cultivating the people who care so much that they actually look you up on Facebook.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.040]   I think that's those are people you want to cultivate on.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.640]   And I don't mean that in the phone.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.080]   Leo, you don't even answer your email for God's sake.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.040]   Well, this is a way that that's exactly what this is.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   This is a way to participate.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   You're not to answer your email.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Oh, believe me.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   I got so much.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.800]   But I have to stop the stop the stop the music because this is now officially the largest
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.000]   Twitter panel ever joining us now.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Patrick Norton.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.480]   Patrick, are you there?
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480]   I'm here.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   Wow.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.000]   So now let me just recap.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.400]   We've got John C. Devorak.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.360]   We've got Callie Lewis from Geek Brief TV.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.160]   We've got Will Harris from channel.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.640]   Kelly, you've got.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.240]   We've got Don Liza here from the digital home.cnet.com.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:13.160]   We've got Robert Scobel from everywhere.com.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.320]   And now ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.440]   The only guy who doesn't have his own web page doesn't have his own Facebook, doesn't
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.320]   have a Twitter, doesn't have nothing, but he has a baby and a wife.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.480]   Hey, I have a Twitter and a Pounce account.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   You do?
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   Have you ever posted there?
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   Yeah, once in a while.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   I have to add you to my Twitter.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   Wait, what is yours?
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.920]   I have to look up my Twitter.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.840]   I've completely forgotten that.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   What's your pound?
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.920]   Yeah, some important it is to them.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   I know it is Erzatz friends, but I kind of like the idea.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Oh, you need to use that hard up for love Leo.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.280]   That's why I'm a broadcaster.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.480]   That's all we ever want.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.280]   Just the love and approval of all of our friends that we never met.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.760]   You're just a friend I've never met.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.080]   Am I imaginary friends?
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   Yes.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.080]   I don't like friends.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.720]   John doesn't need friends.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.920]   John doesn't need anything.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.560]   John needs a good pulled pork once in a while and he's happy.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.840]   I had a lot of sight pulling my pork.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.280]   What I really need is to clean my office.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.960]   Oh, I need that too.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.760]   I don't need to be twittering around and going on to Facebook and pretending to be friends
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   with people I've never met.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.080]   But John, what are you doing instead of it?
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.120]   I need to finish my book for God's sake.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   You're not doing any of that.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.080]   I need to get that free West Virginia hoodie.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.440]   That's what he really needs.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.840]   My real problem is the fact that number one, I don't think anyone really cares what I'm
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.400]   doing at any point in the day.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.360]   Or two, to be honest with you, I don't really care what anybody else is doing.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.360]   I have a PALS account and I don't even use that.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.840]   I think the ones where people tell you about their lunch are annoying, but every so often
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.560]   you get this stream of incredibly useful information.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.320]   I think a lot of it depends on who you're paddling around with.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.320]   Well, that could be too.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.600]   I try to make it useful.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.840]   I found Twitter to be extremely fun and useful at times.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.240]   You can get into these conversations.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.120]   I try not to have conversations spam if that's what you want to call it.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   You have to be careful.

[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   You have to be careful.

[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   You have to be careful.

[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   You have to be careful.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   You have not been listening long enough, Robert.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   This is the man who gets no spam.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   Are we offended by beacon, Facebook's beacon or should we just move on?
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   God.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   Remember that story?
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   How about Firefox?
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   Firefox 3.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:21.120]   Do I see these beacon things that the developing story will get to it next week?
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   That is right.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   Like the Kindle, we will talk about it next week.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Amazon has backed down over the one-click pattern.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   A New Zealand actor challenged Amazon.com over its one-click pattern.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.120]   He has been fighting for three years.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   He says I invented one-click.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   According to documents posted last month in the US patents and trademark office, Amazon has amended its claim
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   over the one-click patent to include Peter Calvelli.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   It is narrowing down their patent claim, which is what he wanted.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.120]   He says this breaks the monopoly of shopping with one-click.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.120]   It is exactly what I wanted.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   Victory!
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   Woah-hoo!
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   That one-click shopping.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   I do not know what is in the monopoly.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   I love one-click.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   It has cost me a lot of money.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   I just keep clicking all day.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   We do not have to go on.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Go ahead, Josh.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   Well, I am just saying, let's get back to the Firefox 3.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.120]   Is anybody upgraded to this thing I have?
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   I did not like it.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   Anybody?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   I have.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   It seems faster.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   You learn?
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   There is a little faster, but you keep...
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   There is a bunch of messages that come up.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   It says you are going to an encrypted page.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   Is that okay?
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   And then it says, "Do not show this anymore or show it anymore.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   I keep getting this message and I clicked it so I would stop getting the message.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120]   I still get the message."
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   We are all suffering now because there are so many stupid computer users.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   Now we, who understand how this stuff works, have to click every five seconds to say, "Yes,
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   I did mean to do that.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   Yes, no, okay.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   Yes."
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   And it is because there are so many morons.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   Do you ever think there needs to be a Firefox or Windows power user edition?
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   Where it is just like stripped back.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   There is no prompts you get access to.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.840]   You go into C drive and it does not tell you that your C drive has protected files that
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.920]   you should not access.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.120]   It just lets get us out of the way.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   You should be able to root everywhere.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   Yeah, there should be an advanced user's download.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   Definitely.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   You know what?
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   You should have a stupid person computer and make sure all the stupid people buy that one.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   You know what?
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   I am going to be really controversial though.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   So if you want the power user computer, just go buy a Mac.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   Mac, you know, it is what I think.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.120]   What makes Mac so power user at this point?
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   Well, hey, it has got the most insane multitasking like built into the OS and V.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   And screaming and howling was heard from the entire open source community.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   Hand-pointed people over the sun.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   Oh, come on.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   You know, who really uses open source anyway?
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   Oh, heresy.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   Well, I never got a bad one.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   No, I mean, I'm sorry to sound like you're a Frampton on the double album.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   So, I mean, I get Firefox on the Mac though.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   The new Firefox 3's biggest claim to fame is its native UI.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   So if you're using Vista, it looks like Vista.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.120]   If you're using OS 10, it looks like OS 10.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.120]   Yeah, it's also an alpha.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   It's very early, right?
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   I don't know.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   Yes, actually, the best Firefox was 1.5, frankly.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   I think 2.0 hasn't been that great.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   I agree with you there.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   What would happen if I was 5?
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   You guys have a problem with 2.0?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.120]   Yes, haven't you?
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   No.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   It's great.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   Finally, somebody's having problems and I'm not with an app.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   It's great.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   It's your day.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   I think it could be extensions based, but the main reason to use Firefox is all the extensions,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   right?
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   I mean, that's the point.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   No, I use Firefox because it sucks a thousand percent less than Internet Explorer.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   I think IE7 is actually pretty good.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.120]   Now, the new IE6 was getting to be in that.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   IE6 was awful.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   IE6 was awful.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   Still clumsy.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   I do a lot of feed reading and Google Reader and Firefox is way faster on Ajax pages.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   Safari is pretty good, though, on the Mac.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   I think it's very fast.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   Oh, I hate Safari.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   I don't like it either.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   I hate it too.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   It blows up too many pages.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   Hey, I got the -- by the way, just to kind of circle around on what we were talking about
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   a couple of weeks ago with you, Patrick, I got the Asus EEPC.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   Patrick didn't like it on the other hand.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   I think it's fun.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   I mean, but I think it's too expensive for what it is.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   We'll like it.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   But we'll think Mac is the only fricking multitasking power user.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   Well, I tease well because I care.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   The bad news for me, anyway, is my dog ate a power adapter.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   I only got to use it for a day.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   I liked it.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   I was able to type on it and stuff.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   I'm looking forward to trying it more.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   It looks like the Kindle adapter is exactly the same adapter.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   So I'm hoping that we'll plug it in and see what happens, Leo.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   Just go to Radio Shack.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   I thought it had a regular -- no, it's not.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   It's some weird, you know, nine volt.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   It's very strange.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   It's not a normal adapter.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.120]   Is it a weird pin or a weird voltage?
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   Weird voltage is easy.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   Weird pin outs are hard.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   I don't know.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   I have to look at the -- I think it's a standard pin.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   Yes, it looks like there's some dog crap to find it.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   No, he didn't swallow it.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   He just chewed it and spit it out.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   I hate that.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   He nodded.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   He broke it right in half.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   I hate that.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   I hate it when that happens.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   How's the baby Patrick?
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   The baby's good.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.120]   You sleep last night.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   Not even a little bit.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   He's sleeping now.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   Yeah, they always sleep when you're awake.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   Midnight until 2.30 last night, he was eating and fussing and eating and fussing and, you
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   know, then did the whole pooping thing.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   How old's your kid, Patrick?
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   Oh, just hit in five weeks.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.120]   Yeah, one, eight weeks.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   It's amazing.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   Not soon enough.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   Alex Lindsay had his baby yesterday, by the way.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   He had a boy.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.120]   Don't know what the name is yet.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   So we have all of -- it's amazing how many babies.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.120]   Twit babies here.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   All at the same time, it's time for a cage match.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   With the babies of the parents.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   Well, actually both.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   Who can change a diaper fastest, right?
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   So here's a --
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.120]   He's changing a diaper without opening my eyes now.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.120]   It's funny.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.120]   The first time he changed a diaper, it's hard.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.120]   It's pretty steep learning curve.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   You get over it really quick.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   It doesn't take a long time to learn.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.480]   Well, I'm quite impressed with both of you that you've been able to keep up with everything
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.120]   that you're doing, having just had a baby.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.120]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.120]   Well, you know, it's funny that way.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   Rent, food, bills.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   Actually, that winged the thing about the kimbles.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   You can read a book while holding the baby.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   You hold one in the palm of each hand.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Once you figure out how to hold it.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   But the baby --
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   The baby or the kimbles?
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120]   The kimbles.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   No.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   That's a baby.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   Rather.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   By the way, I'm loving Tekzilla.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   You're doing a great job, Patrick.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   It's just getting better and better.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   It is really an enjoyable show.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   As long as we're giving that plug, I want to make sure people go to revision 3.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   .com/tekzilla with a K and a Z.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   Hey, T-E-K.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   I have like the --
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.120]   Z-I-L-L-A.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.960]   What is this rumor we're seeing that Murdoch's going to buy dig and that maybe you would
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   be going along.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   Revision 3 would be going along.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   Have you seen this rumor?
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   No, that's news to me.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.480]   I think the best part about working -- because I've worked for startups before, so if you
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.640]   Leo, but this is sort of the most silicon-valleyish startup I've ever worked for.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Which means we actually have all these VC involved, which means, hey, you know what?
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.200]   Maybe we're getting sold right now.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   Somebody could be signing contracts.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   Right.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   I hate that feeling.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.320]   We had that feeling at Tek TV for like three years.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   It was god awful.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:33.200]   Well, there was a difference between the thing at, you know, the Ziff Davis -- I should say
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.680]   not Ziff Davis, the boy, Paul Allen, Volk Adventures.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.600]   Volk Adventures was just a whole fascinating experience to its own self.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.520]   I don't have that feeling here.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.280]   But hey, who knows?
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   Digging gets sold tomorrow.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   Revision 3, he gets sold.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Well, here's what happened.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.320]   This all comes from ValleyWag.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   Here's what happened.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   Women, the old pro-
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   DIG.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   All articles on W.S.J.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.480]   dot com, the Wall Street Journal's online site, have dig buttons now.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.720]   You can dig a story.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   And once you do, that story becomes open to the public.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.480]   It no longer requires a subscription to read.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.080]   So there is something going on between Dig and Wall Street Journal and Rupert.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.560]   Well, I mean, Wall Street Journal's playing catch-up, right?
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:40.960]   The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, I mean, what's kind of funny is like, you know,
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.320]   you think of Wall Street Journal as the home of one of the most powerful journalists in
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.360]   technology, but they haven't been as advanced online as maybe they could be.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.000]   The Times has played around with some stuff.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   They're still playing catch-up.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Adding dig buttons.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.360]   You know, you see dig buttons.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.400]   Then half does another kind of social networking site button starting to show up on articles
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.920]   on a lot of very mainstream web.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.080]   The Times has been doing it for a while.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.600]   But the difference is that all of a sudden these subscription-only articles are now suddenly
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   open to the public.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.080]   Well, I think that's smart.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   Yeah, I guess it's...
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   You've got to remember something.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   It's a...
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:18.040]   You know, this still comes down to a "I need eyeballs to look at web pages."
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.280]   And this is probably...
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.800]   This is a very trackable experiment in revenue, right?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   So how are you going to feel when...
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   It's about an use.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.080]   How are you going to feel when Texilla is available only on Hulu.com?
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.800]   I don't even know what Hulu.com is.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.520]   Oh, well, see, that's Google Murdoch and NBC's website.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.760]   By the way, I finally got my invitation to visit Hulu.com.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.040]   This is where the office went and what a crappy site.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   I don't...
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   Has anybody else used Hulu?
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   I had it.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   I don't have an invitation.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.560]   You can't invite you, Kelly.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.720]   You have to go to Hulu.com and apply.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.760]   Yeah, I guess all of us here probably could.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   So Don...
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.080]   It's just a flash-based.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   You can expand it.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.800]   There's one weird thing which is that you can embed anything into a website like YouTube.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:06.120]   So I guess they're encouraging people to put their videos on their site.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.120]   Hulu is?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.680]   Well, this Hulu is pretty mainstream.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.680]   I mean, at least it looks like...
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.680]   Oh, it is.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   It's NBC.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   It's going to help.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.280]   You find and enjoy the world's premium content when, where and how you want it.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   Well, no, this is great.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   But they obviously...
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   They've read the revision three manifesto.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   No, no.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.680]   That's what happened when NBC pulled off of iTunes.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.080]   And Fox pulled off of iTunes and said, "No, you cannot sell our shows.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.600]   We're going to make people go to our proprietary site and our flash-
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   It says right under Hulu.com/splash/boughts about us.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.920]   We're going to help you enjoy the world's premium content when, where and how you want
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   it.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   Oh, hallelujah.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   Thank goodness.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   And I thought it was a profit thing.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   A closed flash system?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.480]   Oh, of course it's a profit thing.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.840]   You can't download the files.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.560]   You can't put them on any player.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.560]   You can only...
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   The only thing you can do is embed them.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.960]   Well, is that because they can't do it or because they're waiting for Adobe to finish
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   their cool guy?
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   That might be interesting.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.320]   VRM management software that will allow that, the flash-based stuff that they've been working
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   on for you.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   Right.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.320]   That could be.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   You might be right.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.680]   So on Friday, ValleyWag says, "As if the Dig News Corp deal is done, will Dig News Corp
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.920]   deal include revision three?"
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   I don't think any of this is true.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.560]   Hey, who knows?
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   The room is...
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.160]   Sometimes he's on a dog's ass once in a while.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:27.000]   We've heard a very specific number rooted about News Corp rumor has it would pay $340
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.720]   million to buy Dig and would, according to this, take a Steak-in revision three.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.640]   Well, a Steak-in revision three isn't the same as owning revision three.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.280]   No, that's true.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:45.960]   There was talk at some point about Fox or Rupert Murdoch buying into Ziff Davis and
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.680]   door tech TV.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.440]   And at that point, I kind of got queasy.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.280]   I wasn't anxious to do that.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.640]   Well, I mean Rupert Stark, he's just bought the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.120]   He obviously has a bit of success, both with his investment choices and his history in
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   publishing.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.360]   You know, if he ends up owning it, hey, you know what?
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.200]   Maybe I'll be replaced by someone younger, attractive and more smarter, maybe with a degree
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   in engineering.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.960]   Like as they told us in the screensavers, all of these is more cleavage.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   Well, what was the...
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.740]   Crazy was at the end of that Valley Web rumor was that Murdoch really wanted to stake in
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.520]   revision three because he wanted Kevin Rose to front the Fox Business News Network technology
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   approach.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.400]   Okay, I'm going to take that story off the list.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.960]   I didn't get that far.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.080]   Yeah, hi, it's Kevin Rose and I'm drinking very early.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   No, no, no.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.880]   Also, once he used Rose, Kevin Rose for coverage of CES, the large gadget trade show in January.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   Well, that would make sense.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:44.080]   Which is a kind of an interesting...the Fox Business Network needs eyeballs, right?
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:50.880]   So they hired Kevin and Kevin has the core, you know, dignity audience plus the core dig
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.440]   audience potentially giving them more traffic.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   That would be very smart.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.760]   So I can see where that might actually be useful to them.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.880]   That's a very not traditional media way of thinking about it.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.280]   What are your guys' plans for CES?
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.840]   I think we're sending a small crew down to film for TEXA.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   Nothing.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.440]   No live shows down there this year.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.480]   Will you going to be going to CES?
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.160]   You know, I'm thinking about it.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.040]   The trouble is, you know, as John says, it's completely over-covered.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.640]   And so it's like, what can you really bring to it that a million people aren't already
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.680]   bringing with bigger budgets.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   So I'm dubious about it.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   How about you, John?
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   CES?
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.760]   You know, I have to go because there's a...PC Magazine has a party on Tuesday night.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.880]   And so they want me to show up.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.440]   So I'm going to probably fly down there and then fly back the next day.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.520]   I can't see really spending much time with the show because it's just...like, you know,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.560]   we'll said that I said, which is it's over-covered.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.400]   I don't...I can get more out of reading the coverage and then analyzing that.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.840]   And I can't actually be on the show floor.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.240]   I do like to bump into a bunch of people and say, "Hey, I haven't seen you for a year.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.240]   Let's do lunch."
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   And then they never see them again for another year.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.000]   I mean, I'm getting sick of that too.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.760]   But the one thing is walking around the floor last year, I was watching in gadget and Gizmodo.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.360]   And I knew, you know, everybody on the show floor knew what Steve Jobs had done.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   And he wasn't even at.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.680]   They were all following the match because Macworld coincided last year.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   This year it will not.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.920]   There will be different weeks.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.360]   We're still doing the blog house, by the way, at the Bloggio.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.560]   Well, that'll be fun.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.200]   I'll get some free bandwidth.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   That's for CES.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   That'll be a lot of fun.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   There's a lot of fun left here.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   We had 600 bloggers come through there.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.840]   I would be down there doing the radio show if we're over a weekend, but it's not.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.480]   I will in 2009, but I can't do it in 2008.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.240]   Steve, Bill Gates last keynote, right?
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.320]   Is that going to be exciting?
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   Oh, boy.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.760]   Callie, you're going to be there covering it?
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   I'm just that.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   Wait.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   Will you be there covering it?
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.520]   Maybe you could make a little Bill Gates screensaver for the iPod.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   Maybe I could.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.160]   Yeah, I'll be there at least for a day.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.040]   I don't know how long we're going to stay.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.720]   We haven't quite figured that out yet.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.040]   John has a great video you could use.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.040]   Used to use that in your speeches.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   Didn't you, John, of Bill Gates going, "Loop, loop, loop."
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   Oh, no.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   I like Bill Gates.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.640]   Yeah, well, you would.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.040]   I have the, yeah, go out.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.000]   Not to be palmer, but he gulps and gulps and gulps.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.280]   So you took, this was back when you had a video toaster.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.520]   I think he took all the gulps and strung them in one long video.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.520]   It was like an hour of gulping.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   I'm making a, you put that on the iPod.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.240]   Maybe some music by Jeff Smith.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.640]   You got something there.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.480]   Yeah, I'll have to get that video from you.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.160]   Here's a story from Edinburgh.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.880]   I'm really reaching for this one.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.280]   Robert, let's see.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.480]   Guy's name was Mark Morrison.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.240]   He called in sick, but he did it in a way that business didn't approve of.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.640]   He texted in his sick.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.200]   He says, "I can't come to work today."
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.920]   Then he didn't show up again.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   They finally fired him.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   They said, "The company says you have to call or use our official system."
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   You cannot--
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.360]   He should have fired him with a text message.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   Well, the good news is, in Edinburgh Court, they call it a tribunal, says that the company
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.280]   is wrong and they awarded them compensation of 6,977 pounds, which in the US dollars is
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.200]   like $4 million, I think.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.880]   Give or take.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.240]   And overturned the ruling.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.240]   So there you go.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.480]   So it's okay to text in sick in Edinburgh.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.440]   So they fired him because of the text or because he kept calling in sick.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   What was the reason?
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.800]   They fired the reason was because you're not allowed to text in sick.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   You have to call.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   God.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.600]   It seems like we could have called it a better.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.040]   How lazy do you have to be to not even--
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.400]   I mean surely it's actually more work to text than it is to be.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.760]   And you don't have to prove anything when you text in.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   You don't have to go.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.560]   Yeah, I'm not feeling text.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.080]   If you're bad at having a sick voice, you're good to go.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.280]   Ferris Bueller would have gotten a lot of mileage out of that.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.960]   Most of the people under 25 years of age, they do almost everything in texting.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.320]   I don't see that it's a big deal.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.960]   Yeah, I think this is the future.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.680]   Well, it is that they don't text, say, their boss or they don't.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   If you've got a--
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   Don't text the old guys.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   Well, no.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   I mean, think about this way.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.080]   If it's a job where you got a-- and it sounds like it's probably--
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.240]   is he waiting tables?
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Is he a school teacher or something?
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.160]   Is it a job where they need to get somebody in the cover of his shift?
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.880]   And one random text may not get to the person who actually has to do all the stuff to cover
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.080]   that guy's slot.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.560]   I don't know.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.120]   It seems like it's not that delete, exploitive, hard to make a phone call to say you're not
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   going to be in work.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.120]   Well, you--
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   You had Edinburgh tribunals disagree.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.120]   And Patrick, that sounds like an old fart talking.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   It's been--
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   I'm the oldest fart in this--
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.240]   Now that he's a papa, he has to be an old fart.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.360]   No, I've been an old fart for a long time.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   Right.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.200]   You've always been a little older than your age.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.920]   The Mall of America is using text messages.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:09.240]   When you park at the Mall of America on Black Friday, a day before yesterday, you could
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.600]   text-- send a text message to a short text and it would send you your location where
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.240]   you left your car.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.800]   Apparently, the Mall is so big about 50 shoppers lose their car every day and the day after
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.440]   Thanksgiving, they expect about 400 people to lose their cars, so they want you to text
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   it.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   That's awesome.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   It's a piece of wall.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.440]   Isn't that great?
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   Have you ever seen--
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.440]   Do you guys have a store around there?
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   Say again.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.280]   Are the parking lot there?
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.480]   They've got hundreds of acres of parking around there.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.280]   Yeah, they got like eight parking lots.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.800]   Do you guys have the system in the states of the-- of like, where you text to pay your
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   palm?
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.200]   Oh, it's the worst thing in the world.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   You don't like it?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.840]   Well, it's a version over here.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.840]   It is terrible.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:55.520]   I mean, you phone it like-- so you're in a rush and you want to go buy a-- you know,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   put a quid in the ticket.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.520]   Oh, you have to wait.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.520]   You can't do that, right?
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.720]   You have to phone this number and it says, right, where are you?
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.000]   And they say, right, Oxford.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.120]   Do you mean, you know, Worcester?
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   No, Oxford.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:13.440]   And you're like, OK, what's your-- you say, what's your license plate for your car?
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:21.920]   It's like, you know, F, D, 7, A. Did you mean S, B, A, 9?
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   No!
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.160]   I've missed trains trying to get this blinking.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.640]   Unless you have great things.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.000]   They do it in the train station, right, by in Oxford.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Right.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.560]   But whenever there's a train on the platform, the ambient noise is such that the system
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   can't hear you.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.560]   That's good.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.480]   So if you get to the platform, get on a train and you're trying to pay for your parking,
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.480]   you can't do it.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.720]   It's the train that you want to get on to leave before you can pay for the parking.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   So you can't get back to your ex-girlfriend.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.720]   That's good.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.480]   Oh, I want to remind you this program brought to you as always by Audible.com.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.800]   We're not going to do a long book.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.280]   We did a long book talk last time.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   That was kind of fun.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.120]   And by the way, John, I went out and I bought the Jacques Ilul books.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.800]   I got them, the Technological Society and Propaganda.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.640]   Ah, good.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.440]   The type is so small.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.960]   Well, on Technological Society and that Propaganda.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.440]   Did you get an old card copy?
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   No, they're paperback.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.920]   They're still in print.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:22.520]   But I'm going to have to scan it and put it on my Kindle just to read the damn thing.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.440]   Anyway, Audible.com/twit.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.000]   This, I think maybe it's just because I'm getting old or something, but I like it that
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   I can listen to a book.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.320]   I don't have to worry about how big the print is.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   I can listen.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.600]   And I somehow, for me, I absorb the information.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.920]   But I love audiobooks.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.600]   And Audible.com has 45,000 plus titles.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.480]   They play on pretty much any device.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.960]   Now through November 27th, half price on 1,000 plus unabridged titles.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.880]   So it's a great way to stock up.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   That's the nice thing.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.800]   There's no term on these.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.600]   As long as you want, you don't have to wait till you don't have to send them back after
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.040]   a month if you don't get around to reading it.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.560]   Well, you keep it and you read it when you feel like it.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.080]   I have hundreds of books on my iPhone, which I love it.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.360]   So anybody have a recommendation for an Audible book they've listened to lately?
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.280]   Because I have some if you don't.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.200]   But I like to give you the opportunity.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.840]   Now I'm looking for Stephen King's The Mist.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.360]   Have you seen The Mist yet?
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.160]   I've seen previews.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   I haven't seen it.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.480]   It's supposed to be really scary.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.800]   They have a lot of Stephen King books.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.160]   I'm just wondering if they have the shining.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.720]   They have Carrie.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.800]   69 Stephen King books.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.240]   They must have The Mist.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.080]   Anyway, if you're a Stephen King fan, Salem's lot, there is nothing spookier than turning
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.920]   out the lights.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.880]   Listening to a great reading of one of his books.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Audible.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   Hearts in Atlantis.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   I read that one on Audible.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   That was great.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.160]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.920]   I'm still looking dream catcher.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.920]   Bag of bones.
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   Oh, on writing is a great.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   You're a writer.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   Oh, on writing is awesome.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   Great book.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   Yes.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   Sorry.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.080]   No, I didn't know.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.440]   It's kind of a half memoir half about how he writes.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.840]   I thought it was really useful for writers.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   You're a writer.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.560]   Callie, you write.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.080]   You're writing a book right now.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.480]   I think you and Neil, right?
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:26.560]   Well, ever since we started Geek Brief, we started that it'll be done, but we have
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.120]   to figure out how to get some time to ourselves from Geek Brief.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   Well, just watch.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.120]   And I, you'll learn everything else that we're doing.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.320]   Fire this you log thing is going to be huge.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.880]   You're going to be able to write that book finally.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.040]   Thanks to the you log.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.720]   Many of these Stephen King books unabridged and half price.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.000]   So it's a good time to stock up on Stephen King at audible.com slash twit.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.240]   Go there by the way to get a credit toward a free book when you join up.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.360]   And it can be a Stephen King book.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   Audible.com slash twit.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.680]   We do thank them for their support this week in tech.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.200]   Has anybody played any new games?
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.560]   I've been playing Assassin's Creed really enjoying it.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560]   Anybody played crisis?
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560]   You played crisis yet?
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.800]   Well, I've been playing it all day today.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.880]   It's quite funny.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:16.480]   So I quite like it, but it's one of those games like unless you have an absolute monster
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.560]   of a PC like a monster don't even bother because you might as well take like a brand
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:29.120]   new HD movie and play it on like a 14 inch tube with, you know, mono sound or something.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.920]   You just don't want to do it.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.320]   And so if you can't play the game on the absolute top settings, don't even bother.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.440]   It's my is my opinion.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.040]   I have a crossfire system.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.680]   So I should be able to do it on that, right?
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.520]   No, probably no.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.240]   No, it's a crossfire.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.960]   It's optimized for Nvidia.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   I hate it.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   But I do that.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.040]   Does Nvidia pay these game designers to do that?
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.560]   Is that why that happens?
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.920]   No, well, it's not that they pay them.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.360]   It's just they have a lot more money in the first place to help them out.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   Oh, help them out.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   Oh, we help.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   Here's a bag of cash.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   We're going to help you out with the development.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.440]   I mean, Nvidia can pay for engineers to go and like just sit in these game design studios
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.520]   for weeks on end and optimize code.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.720]   So I like this crossfire system.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.680]   So you say it plays BioShock.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.920]   Well, you're saying it won't be enough?
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.560]   I mean, unless it plays BioShock at like, you know, a high resolution with everything
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.280]   turned on at 60 frames a second.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   Exactly.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   And we'll do that.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.280]   Oh, well, you might get away with it then.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   It's pretty high, actually.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:39.000]   But I mean, I'm playing on an 8800 GTX, which is the single fastest, basically Nvidia card.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.880]   And I'm getting like maybe an average 20 frames a second.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   What?
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   Really?
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   But you have...
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.440]   Well, this is with anti-aliasing and shading and all that.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.040]   And then, no, no, no, that's with all the details on high, no anti-aliasing whatsoever.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   What?
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]   You just can't turn it on.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.080]   How can they design a game that's so tough that even the highest end system can't play
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080]   it well?
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   Well, I mean, that's it.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.480]   You only get the most out of it if you've got a quad-core CPU because it does all the
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.920]   physics and AI on different cores on the CPU.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.160]   And then you need a dual graphics, preferably high-end Nvidia graphics system to be able
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   to play it.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.520]   You're describing a $5,000 machine to play this game.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   Pretty much.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.520]   Apparently, I mean, on May 8th, I'm only playing at 1280 resolution.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   That's true.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   That's true.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.080]   You're trying to kill off development so they can go off console.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   Maybe.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.120]   I mean, that's the advantage of these consoles.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.680]   You don't have to worry about that stuff.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.360]   But you'll never see anything as good as crisis, or will you?
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.080]   Well, in a couple of years, maybe.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.960]   But the crisis, right now, I can't see anything in the next 12 months on the development cycle
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   that looks as good as crisis.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960]   I'm going to buy it.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   Can you buy it?
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   It's still just download.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   No, it's out.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   It's out.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   How about you, Don?
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   What have you been playing lately?
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.320]   Well, I haven't played crisis.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.520]   I don't really do the PC stuff.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.240]   But I think I'm going to get lots and lots of bad emails for this.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.160]   But I've been playing Super Mario Galaxy.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   I play Assassin's Creed.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   No, you know what?
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.960]   Everybody's telling me Super Mario Galaxy is the best game ever.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.920]   Well, I'm telling you that it's not.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920]   I don't really--
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   You know, I can't--
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   It's not that great.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.920]   My daughter plays it.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   It's OK.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.160]   It's the Wii killer game, everybody's saying it's a game.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]   You know what?
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   I can't stand.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.240]   Number one, OK, I know it's Nintendo.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.760]   I know they've been doing it for years.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:29.200]   But why don't I have to sit through the awful and boring and disgustingly awful text messages
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.200]   that we have to sit through.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   Oh, I know.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   They talk.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.040]   And then, of course, this is what really gets me and I can't get over it.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.720]   This stupid shaking my hand.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.040]   It's a gimmick and I can't stand it.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.040]   I can't stand it.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.440]   Why don't I have to sit there and shake my hand at it after everything I have to do for
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.440]   no good reason?
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   You don't like the Wii Mo.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.600]   No, not even-- no, like in the game.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.760]   You have to shake your Wii Mo in order to do a few things.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   You have to--
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   You have to do what?
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   Can you say that again?
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.920]   All right, let me try to break it down a little bit.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   Make it G-Ray.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.680]   Basically, shake your Wii Mo and--
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   What do you call it?
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   --mario spin a little bit.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   And Wii Mo.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.680]   You're talking about the Wii controller.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.680]   Yes.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.680]   You're Wii Mo.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.680]   Oh, I'm not talking about something.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680]   Hey, it's Mario.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.000]   I thought we were-- I didn't know where we were going with that one.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   No, but I don't know.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.560]   I don't like-- I think it's a gimmick and I don't know.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   I've been playing it.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.520]   I've played through about half the game, I'd say, by now.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.560]   And so far, I'd say, eh, it's OK.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.160]   In my mind, there's nothing special.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   I mean--
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.800]   But I know I'm going to get lots and lots of bad emails for it.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   But eh, whatever.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   Hey, I'm Mario.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.600]   Come on, shake your my Wii Mo.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.240]   Yeah, the only thing I'm playing right now is Portal.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240]   Portal?
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   You mean, Portal's great.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240]   I love Portal.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.840]   I haven't got the Xbox yet.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   No.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.520]   We played this song, though, the other show.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520]   I got to beat it.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.520]   Play it there.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   We got some friends of some--
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.520]   The game that is, or something.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.960]   With Portal?
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   Mass Effect.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.440]   Oh, Mass Effect, I can't wait to get.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.320]   I hear that's going to be-- that's an Xbox 360 game.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   That's supposed to be--
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   Yeah, a couple of friends.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   I've just completely dropped off the radar.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.920]   I think this is going to be a good holiday season out
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.560]   for all three game machines.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.200]   The Nintendo Wii, though, is pulling ahead.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.640]   They're now tied for market share of the Xbox 360.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.000]   And I think they may start to pull ahead a little bit here.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.840]   I'm still of the opinion that the Wii is a multiplayer mini-game console.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.600]   And I don't think it has longevity right now.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   I really don't.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.680]   You're a 360 guy or a PS3 guy?
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.440]   Well, right now my PS3 is collecting dust.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.120]   But I play my 360 every now and then.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120]   I play all three.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.280]   I try to do as many as much as I can.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.280]   Apparently it doesn't play anything.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   I just shake my we-mo.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.200]   That's enough, frankly.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200]   That's all I need to do.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:45.840]   How many--
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.520]   Scoble, do you play any games at all?
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.840]   Yeah, barely.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.400]   You don't have time.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   You got a baby, too.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.280]   I got a baby.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.760]   My son plays games when I watch him.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.040]   He's a world of Warcraft or--
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.000]   Patrick, yeah.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.480]   He played Halo 3 in a weekend.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.920]   My son--
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.600]   We're looking at a really interesting situation
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.000]   where if the Wii does go past the Xbox 360
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.680]   and turns into like installed base,
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.520]   it's not inconceivable that it could go past the installed
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.280]   base of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 combined.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.600]   And then suddenly, if you're a game developer,
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.640]   the largest market is Nintendo Wii.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.240]   And you're looking at a backward step, practically.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:20.760]   Wow.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.840]   The console development.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   Wow.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.340]   I mean--
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.600]   That's why it won't happen.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.160]   They won't let it happen.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.520]   And video take pockets of money over there and say, it's--
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.600]   This isn't going to happen, is it?
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.760]   You're going to get out of the business, aren't you?
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   I don't know.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.840]   I think the real gaming marvel right now is a DS.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.160]   I think the DS is unbelievable.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.440]   Yeah, people love the DS.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.640]   What game are you playing on the DS now, Don?
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.080]   I play Zelda--
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.880]   Oh, because I need a DS game.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.720]   I got my DS here.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.220]   But--
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.480]   The new Zelda game is hot.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:51.980]   Zelda.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.480]   All right.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.240]   What the hell's the name?
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.480]   I can't remember the name.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.080]   I'm not going to go.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.400]   Zelda is hot.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.920]   If in an hourglass-- thank you.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920]   Yeah, they're--
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   Phantom Hourglass.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   All right.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.720]   I mean, honestly, if you look at Nintendo's cycle of handheld--
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.920]   obviously, the upgrade I've ever
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.760]   seen in the game, I've never seen it before, but the Game Boy
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.200]   lasted about 15 years.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.480]   And it's, you know, it's sold quite-- obviously, I think
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.240]   it's the best selling of all time.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.520]   And if you compare-- I wrote about this on C9.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.120]   I did some research, and I found out that the DS is actually
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.080]   selling far better right now than the Game Boy at the same
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:24.560]   stage.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560]   And it's actually over time.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's doing quite well.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.280]   And if Nintendo can stick to this 15-year upgrade of the DS,
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.080]   and obviously, you can do it with all the DS, you might see
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.400]   this become bigger than the Game Boy.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.240]   Oh, I think we should wrap this guy up.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.480]   It's our Thanksgiving leftovers show, and we had more
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.520]   leftovers as usual than ever.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.160]   You guys all have a good Thanksgiving.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.040]   Will Harris, I know you didn't.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:47.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.960]   What's Thanksgiving?
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.160]   How was Guy Fox Day?
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   Was it a good day for you?
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.760]   Did you burn the guy?
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.040]   No, I hear somebody raised a lot of money, though.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.200]   For Guy Fox?
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.440]   No, it's the whole Ron Paul.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.280]   It wasn't Ron Paul raised $3 million.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.960]   Oh, I got Guy Fox Day.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.840]   I didn't put the two together.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.880]   Did it have anything to do with Guy Fox?
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.160]   Because you could look for a moment.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.080]   Yeah, and Ron Paul is going to let you know.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.400]   Blow it low up the American.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:13.920]   Right.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.120]   Institutions with government.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.960]   I had somebody you want to associate yourself
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.040]   with for your political campaign, Guy Fox.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.480]   That's good.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.680]   See that in the labor party.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.920]   That's good.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.800]   Patrick Norton, I hope you're having a great time
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.360]   with your little baby, Seamus.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.920]   Does he have an Irish accent, Seamus?
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.560]   It's hard to tell.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.160]   Sniff, he's renecked them all, yeah.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.320]   That's pretty much where it's at right now.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.920]   I've heard that a little bit.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.320]   You know what?
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.160]   It goes faster than you think producing their teenagers
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   and they hate your guts.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.640]   So enjoy it now.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.000]   Well, he's already peeing on me.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.920]   So I think I have this sort of non-metaphorical kind
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.280]   of appreciation for the--
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.160]   It's after the battle.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.040]   It begins already.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:52.520]   Oh, man.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.960]   You catch Patrick on "Texilla" with a lot of people.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.040]   You're using everybody now.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.280]   I saw the other day I saw Veronica on it.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:09:59.840]   It's great.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.280]   It's just really a fun show.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.960]   I haven't been on it yet.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.080]   You want to be on it, Scoble?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.560]   I'll be on it.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.800]   Patrick, I'm going to hook you up with this guy named Scoble.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.520]   I've heard of him.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.280]   He's a blogger.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.640]   He knows everything there is to know about social networks.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.120]   He can come on.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.720]   He can bash the Kindle.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.280]   Have you had anybody bash the Kindle yet?
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.960]   No, we're actually trying to get one in for review.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.120]   Robert has one.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.000]   Come on, Robert.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:21.960]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.040]   There we go.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.280]   "Texilla."
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:23.480]   See?
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.000]   Tempting.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   Oh, and we did the $500 PC is back.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:27.760]   Oh, good.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.280]   I love that.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.800]   Although, apparently it won't play any video games ever
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.000]   other than like bejeweled.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.440]   But, you know, it's $500.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:33.920]   It's got to start something.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.920]   What do you want?
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.320]   Patrick Nordock.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.720]   Actually, it's amazing how much power
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.120]   you get for $500 these days.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.960]   "Norton and Corbin, just go to revision3.com/tekzid double A.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.480]   "Texilla."
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.880]   "Hootman."
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.400]   Will Harris is at channel flip.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.560]   He's got TV too, channelflip.com.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.480]   I hear Robert Murdoch is going to buy you and use you
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.040]   to host all future Wimbledon coverage.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.440]   Isn't that exciting?
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   As long as not future coverage of the football team,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.360]   then could be that.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.320]   Could be that.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.680]   The NFL in Britain.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.600]   It's going to be huge.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.000]   Channelflip.com.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:13.640]   What's your latest?
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.960]   Do you got anything you want to mention on there that's
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.320]   coming up?
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.200]   Yeah, we had a cool--
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.120]   if anybody wants to see me make an ass of myself skateboarding,
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.280]   I did an awesome review of the Tony Hawk helmet cam,
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.320]   which it's like this camera that attaches to your helmet
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.880]   while you're skateboarding and films you as you skateboard.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.520]   And we did a very neat video of that.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520]   It's pretty ludicrous.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.560]   I got to hook you up with--
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.040]   Selling that.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.200]   Sorry.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.440]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:40.960]   Check that out.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.160]   At least they get kids to wear helmets.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.000]   I got to hook you up with Brandon Speck.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   He's a Twitch fan and a skateboard fanatic and expert.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.760]   Oh, brilliant.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.680]   I'll hook you up with him.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.440]   Brandon, Will Harris needs some help with his Tony Hawk
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.000]   skateboard helmet cam helmet.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.320]   That was a very cool video.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.520]   Ah!
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.960]   Yeah, there's one shot of me where I do this trick.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.360]   And basically, it all goes wrong.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.040]   And if you play it in slow-mo, you can actually see my leg
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   crumpled backwards beneath me.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.520]   Oh.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.640]   And I feel like a support thing on my knee
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.760]   for the last two weeks.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.280]   Ow.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.720]   So do you ever get on a skateboard?
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.440]   Was this your first time or one of the only times?
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:17.840]   You know, what?
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.520]   I used to be really good when I was a kid.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.040]   When I was like 10, 11, 12, I was brilliant.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.520]   And I hadn't been on a skateboard for about maybe five years.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520]   I thought no worries.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.800]   I can hand--
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.400]   and I just spent a lot of time falling on my ass.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.240]   But through the magic of Final Cut Pro,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.360]   I look like an absolute Tony Hawk genius.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:35.880]   [GRUNTS]
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.760]   And if you play it really in super slow-mo,
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.520]   you can see him shake his we-mo.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.360]   Callie Lewis is, of course, the host of geekbrief.tv.

[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.000]   Of course.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.720]   That's really-- I'm going to put that right now on my iPhone.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.600]   Did you have you guys heard it?
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:01.880]   No.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.920]   It's very pleasant.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.960]   Let me just pull it up here.

[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.280]   I want to make Callie a million bucks with this thing.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.920]   And then I won't have to compete with her any longer.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.160]   [LAUGHTER]

[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600]   I did at the very end.
